I have no\n qualification to speak, yet by your mercy, a humble desire arises within me to offer these\n reflections in appreciation of your compassion and shelter.\n Whatever small understanding I have received in my spiritual life is entirely due to your mercy.\n Even one as weak and unworthy as I am has been given the opportunity to take shelter of Lord\n Krishna, to hear His pastimes, and to serve His devotees - all because of your kindness. I\n cannot fully comprehend the depth of your mercy, yet even a small part of it has brought a new\n life of devotion into my heart.\n By your inspiration, I have come to see that surrender to Lord Krishna is not merely a ritual, but\n a humble offering of the heart - free from personal motives, steady in faith, and grounded in the\n wish to please Him. Although my understanding is limited, your association has planted the\n seed of devotion within me, which continues to grow by your guidance.\n Through your mercy, I have begun to experience bhakti, the eternal function of the soul - a\n natural readiness to serve the Supreme Lord, not for reward, but out of love and humility. I know\n my own limitations, yet your guidance has allowed me to hear the teachings of the Bhagavatam\n attentively, chant the holy names with care, and serve the devotees to the extent I can. These\n are blessings I cannot repay, and I remain deeply grateful.\n By your example, I have also learned the meaning of compassion and respect for all living\n beings. Even I have been inspired to see souls as parts and parcels of Lord Krishna, worthy of\n kindness and care. I bow to this vision, knowing it comes entirely from the shelter of your lotus\n feet.\n You have inspired me to visit the holy dhamas - places where the Lord’s pastimes are eternally\n manifest. With your guidance, I have had the privilege of walking in Vrindavan, Radha-kund,\n Shyama-kund, the Krishna Balaram Mandir, Govardhan, Mayapur, and Jagannath Puri. These\n pilgrimages have awakened humility in my heart. I know that any merit of these holy places\n comes through your mercy, not through my own worthiness.\n You have also given me the treasure of devotee association, which has become my shelter and\n strength. Through your care, I have learned to rise early, attend mangala-arati, hear\n Krishna-katha with attention, and serve the community without expectation. These simple\n practices have brought discipline and devotion into my life, and I know I could not have received\n them on my own.\n By your mercy, I have seen gradual change in my heart. While my faults remain, I notice that\n anger, greed, and dishonesty are losing their hold, even as I continue to stumble. I offer these\n small changes at your lotus feet, fully aware that any goodness I may show is only by your\n mercy, not by my strength.\n \n I have also come to understand that difficulties and inner obstacles are not obstacles but\n humble reminders. They bring me to my knees, showing me that I must rely not on myself, but\n on the shelter of Lord Krishna, on your guidance, and on the mercy of the Vaishnavas.\n I offer my deepest, most sincere gratitude for:\n ● Your unceasing kindness and shelter\n ● The association of the Vaishnavas, which has become my spiritual family\n ● The opportunity to hear and study Srimad Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad-gita\n ● The chance to visit the holy dhamas\n ● The simple blessing of chanting, serving, and hearing - even to the small extent that I\n can\n Realizing my own inadequacy, the only thing I can place before you is my sincere desire to\n serve - however small and imperfect it may be. I pray that I may be allowed to continue serving\n this mission, this community, and this shelter with devotion, steadiness, and gratitude.\n Your unworthy servant,\n Aaradhna Devi Daasi"

The most recent is the Kartik Yatra at Govardhan. This is the mercy I await for the entire year. This year at Govardhan, by your causeless mercy, I was fortunate to assist in Mega Kitchen under the inspirational leadership of HG Gauranga P. I was assisting HG Ajit Mukund P for the pre-processing Seva, which begins very early in the morning at 2 AM. It is a life-memorable experience in assisting cooking Seva to receive the immense blessings \u0026 mercy of thousands of Vaishnavas from all around the world. I am very, very grateful to you for giving me this divine opportunity and eagerly await to continue this Seva for many more years to come!\n Another blessing is the wonderful association I have received here in Damodardesh under the leadership of HG Sri Vallabha P. Here also, I am trying to assist HG Jai Govind P in kitchen Seva weekly. I try to go for the Seva most Sundays. And I am very excited to share the news that we are going to cook for almost 3500 devotees for the yearly most awaited Kirtana Rasa 2025 for three days: breakfast, lunch \u0026 dinner. So I seek your blessings and prayers so that we can serve in the proper mood!!\n Also, I am part of the Bhakti Vriksha group of HG Vrajalilanath P, who is an amazing Vaishnava, where I try to assist in various services like cooking, doing kirtan, giving class, etc. Prabhuji has a very wonderful Bhakti Vriksha group where we celebrate various festivals. We have every Saturday morning Mangal Arati at different houses, and the biggest is the Damodar Arati, which was started by HH Jayapataka Swami here in Damodardesh. So, in every Kartik month, we reach out to thousands of houses and perform Damodar Arati. Recently, we had the grand finale of the Damodar month celebration, where more than 400 devotees came, and we had various cultural programs and amazing kirtans throughout from 6 PM to 10 PM. Also, I try to assist in our Damodardesh Yatras to various holy places in India. All these things I am able to receive only because of your causeless mercy, dear Gurudev, and I am very, very grateful for that!\n Every day, I try to chant my rounds attentively, but somehow there is distraction due to various circumstances. Also, I am not consistent in reading Srimad Bhagavatam, so I seek your blessings so that I can do my sadhana very sincerely for the pleasure of you, Srila Prabhupada \u0026 Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Shyamsunder, and for my purification.\n My sincere prayers for your good health, dear Gurudev, so that you continue your service to your dear spiritual master Srila Prabhupada \u0026 your dear Lordship Sri Sri Radha Gopinath.\n Kindly forgive me for any mistakes or offenses I might have committed in performing the devotional service and seek your divine guidance in improving the quality of consciousness while performing devotional service.\n Thank you very much for everything!!\n Your insignificant servant,\n Abhay Nitai das."

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj.\n Please accept my humble obeisances.\n \n What can I say Maharaj, I am a fool blessed by your mercy. I don\u0027t know what unimaginable mercy has come upon me. I can only remember the day when we caught a train early morning from Pune to reach Chowpatty for your SB class. All the VOICE devotees had planned to come. In rushing to catch the train, I fell down at the gate of Kunjabihari mandir, ISKCON Camp Pune, and both of my knees got bruised, but still, we went ahead and caught the train and reached CST. And from there, we came to your SB class. I don\u0027t remember much of the class, but after the class, you were strolling around the temple, and suddenly some devotee said this is the opportunity to touch the lotus feet of Maharaj. All matajis were touching your feet, and I also felt I should not miss this opportunity. I could touch your feet and soon I thought, what a fool I am, so arrogant to touch your feet.\n I was feeling very sorry, but then I thought I could ask for forgiveness. Then soon I was standing in the courtyard of Radha Gopinath mandir, and you came. I bowed down and in my heart offered a prayer and asked for forgiveness, and you compassionately gazed at me as if you understood everything. After this, only my spiritual life took off. From this day onwards, I never looked back. All my life is just a smooth journey personally orchestrated by Krishna. Only thing I regret is I could have taken birth a little earlier and helped you in manifesting the Chowpatty project. My only aspiration is in the next life, I assist you very closely in making another Chowpatty Mandir in some universe right from the scratch.\n Here now, as I am serving in ISKCON Pune NVCC as a brahmacari, what a great blessing it is to be here under the care of HG Radheshyam Prabhu. Who is an apt representative of yours. Only by the great inspiration of HG Radheshyam Prabhu did the devotees come into my college, and I could get connected. He is like a great father, only because of whose timely guidance I am in the brahmacari ashram today.\n Dear Guru Maharaj, in the recent Kartik Yatra in Govardhan, when you were doing kirtans, you were repeatedly saying, \"Let us give our self fully to the Holy Name.\" This gesture of yours has deeply empowered my chanting. Whenever I now chant, I chant with this effort of giving myself fully, and I feel I am more closer to the Holy Name. Whenever the mind is trying to cheat, your rock-solid and steady image gives me so much solace and strength that I feel I will surely make it in this lifetime by your grace. I wish in some lifetime I come with you, catching your hand at Radha Kunda, the same famous painting where Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Prabhupada is giving his instruction to our Srila Prabhupada at Radha Kunda, and Srila Prabhupada\u0027s son is catching his hand. I am an ignorant fool to think and imagine like this, but this is only what I can think of. Thinking of meeting Radha and Krishna is beyond my scope, but surely I can assist you in your service to Srila Prabhupada.\n And since it is Srila Prabhupada\u0027s glorification, if I don\u0027t do it here, you will not like it, so I will put my best effort to glorify Srila Prabhupada also. I can only dare to hear the sound of the waves on that ferocious ocean in which Jaladuta was crossing the Atlantic. I can\u0027t dare to imagine the seasickness there and what pain Srila Prabhupada could have undergone is unimaginable. I wonder what kind of determination that is; it is humanly impossible. Such tolerance and such burning desire to fulfill the words of Guru. How much faith Srila Prabhupada had on the Holy Name and the message of Srimad Bhagavatam. His love for His disciples is beyond measure.\n So much he has given Himself to everyone. So much he tolerated. And what a compassionate friend He was of Gandhiji. That at the fag end of Gandhi\u0027s life, Srila Prabhupada remembered him. He wrote him and advised. Who else can be such a well-wisher of anyone? He was indeed the ever well-wisher of everyone. His love is beyond comparison. Love of a million mothers is insufficient in front of Srila Prabhupada. So much focus Srila Prabhupada had on the mission. Tireless translations and classes with the clarity of diamond. This certainly can\u0027t be imitated. He envisioned a future of which today I am reaping immense benefits.\n He is still there in the very same temple I am serving, so much accessible through His books. He is an acarya. He can never leave us. He is watching me. I feel I am not doing my best to please Him. Some day I can serve my best to please Him. He speaks with the authority of all the acaryas and yet is as gracious as a swan. He speaks like a concerned father calling his loved son - \"Brahmananda\" or \"Bali-mardana\"... \"You can take charge of this project here.\" So much encouragement and empowerment He gave to all. I can feel a tinge of the loss the disciples of Srila Prabhupada might have felt when He left the planet.\n As an irreparable loss, this is like a calamity. But Srila Prabhupada lives in His instructions and the faithful followers. As a constant guide, He is there in His books. I have no more words to speak. I wish to just try to follow to the best of my capabilities the teachings of Srila Prabhupada. The mountain of anarthas in my heart is huge, but there is hope in the power of the Guru parampara.\n Srila Prabhupada was a fearless preacher, always thinking big.\n Dear Guru Maharaj, as you rightly know me as a fearful and timid servant, you have rightly blessed me by your mercy to take shelter of Srila Prabhupada.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Abhaya Govinda Dasa."

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna\nRespected Maharaj\n\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada\n\nThis is our first offering to you Maharaj after initiation, which happened last year on December 27. We feel more connected to you and Sri Guru Parampara, praying daily on the beads you had kindly chanted upon. Although there is a deep sense of satisfaction for myself, yet, I feel sad for the devotees who missed initiation, which was scheduled for the next day. So many devotees who were much more qualified than me should have received shelter, at least before me. They were waiting for the next day.\n\nYet there is a positive aspect too. By Srila Prabhupada\u0027s grace, so many devotees are\neager to surrender to chanting of the Holy Names. The preaching is increasing, and thus ISKCON as a society is also growing! And I feel very grateful for the efforts you have put in, from the very beginning of accepting Krishna Consciousness to the advanced age today—we always see you tirelessly serving Srila Prabhupada and his divine instructions.\n\nTaking so much effort, every single year you have taken Kartik yatra for all of us. This one festival of coming together, leaving aside as much as possible all our worries and anxieties over petty issues of life, and taking our time for pure Krsna Katha and seva to devotees, is a panacea for continuing us year after year. Hearing from you, we understand how easily we forget the most basic principles of Krishna Consciousness! But it is to our great fortune to be reminded by the words emanating from your lotus mouth. My only wish is to have my consciousness purified by these words and instructions.\n\nGuru Maharaj, in trying to serve in our respective teams, we are also now getting exposed to more and more of the organizational side of ISKCON. Unfortunately, long gone are our days when we were new, thinking everyone to be a pure devotee. Now every single incidence and every involved devotee no longer feels perfect, either within the team or across various teams and various leaders. The issues we face within our team are still overcome, thanks to the able guidance of our seniors, who are following your footsteps. But now, growing up in society, there are more organizational challenges being faced with other teams.\n\nThis year the third time in three years we see a similar situation evolving, where all our efforts are put on toss for some little misunderstanding or underlying emotions against us. As a team, we have suffered various setbacks earlier, and only by the causeless grace of the Lord were we able to come out of these. Yet repeated failures, born not directly out of our mistakes, are deeply saddening. And as we understand, this is because of the material attachments which these leaders bring into devotional service: attachments like possession of money and land, ruling over followers and properties, and needless to mention, strong non-KC attachments for wife, children, and family.\n\nIt is certainly because of my imperfect vision towards devotees. And the very reason I am pointing this out is because these issues exist within my very self. Swearing on our beads, I don\u0027t share this to complain, Maharaj, but only for the reason that a child can cry to his parents. And also, because these setbacks make devotees go through enormous pain. Please pray for these of your crying children, Maharaj. We need strength to carry on following your footsteps. Attachment to your lotus feet is certainly the perfection that will fulfill all our desires. For not only are your lotus feet our shelter, but they have shown the path to walk on the thorny roads of this material world. We have faith; if we stick to the example you have led, we will one day be able to please Sri Sri Radha Krishna.\n\nMaharaj, I feel the need of your blessings, mercy, and prayers even more than ever. On this auspicious occasion of Sri Vyas Puja, I also beg for forgiveness for the countless offenses I have committed at your lotus feet. Please save us from the very anarthas that we are realizing in ourselves. Please award us the service to Vaishnavas.\n\nI also pray to always feel this dependence upon you every moment and aspire forever to serve your lotus feet.\n\nYour servant"

Your every action and word embody the quality of humility and surrender.\n I was very fortunate to have the association of your Holiness at the Kartik Yatra at Sri Govardhan Dham. Nectarean katha and ecstatic kirtans transported myself and thousands of others back to the time when the Lord performed his all-attractive pastimes.\n It’s only by your blessings and the mercy of devotees that I could move into a VOICE Centre recently in association with wonderful devotees.\n As we celebrate your 75th Vyas Puja, I pray to please bless me, so I may eternally chase after those two most precious lotus feet of yours. For I am sure they will lead me directly to the sankirtan party of Gauranga, that is steadily flowing towards the forests where my Srimati Vrndavanesvari Radhika and Shyamsundar perform their eternal pastimes.\n I pray for your health, so that your physical body can keep up with your most thundering, all-consuming, and all-encompassing desire to execute the order of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. I pray for your compassion, Guru Maharaj, to bless me with sincerity and wisdom to make this gift of human life successful by becoming a humble servant of the servant of devotees. I seek refuge at your lotus feet and pray for your forgiveness.\n \n Sri Guru Charane Rati ayishe uttama gati, je parsade pure sarva aasha.\n Most undeserving aspiring servant,\n - Abhinav Gupta."

The day of your appearance is significant for many conditioned souls in this world, and for your disciples it is indeed worshipable. I feel unable to glorify you suitably, but at the same time, I feel very thankful and obliged to you. Therefore, I will make an attempt for your pleasure.\nYou are pure and transcendental, you are full of divine bliss, you are a vast ocean of real knowledge which shines out through your very form and mouth. But you are humble and compassionate to the conditioned spirit souls, for you are Krishna’s pure devotee and His true representative.\nYou are a real and chaste disciple of Srila Prabhupada. Your heart is entirely devoted to him with love, and your relationship with him is so strong and potent that it binds up emotionally even my steel-framed heart.\nYour preaching, with powerful words and with your very presence, brings conditioned souls from Maya’s lap to the lotus feet of Krishna. Thus, you are changing many hearts, planting in them the bhakti lata bija. Then you pour your mercy upon us in the form of your ecstatic kirtans, emotional bhajans, enlightening and inspiring lectures, confidential and delighting darshans. Your holy presence dispels all illusions and doubts and makes our minds peaceful and our hearts blissful.\nYou are tolerant as a careful, loving father for his children. Your mercy is equally distributed, but some are taking more advantage than others. Let me always be a servant and let me always have the association of those sincere and dedicated disciples.\nThis is only a glimpse of the qualities of your transcendental bhagavata personality which I am able to perceive with my limited, contaminated consciousness. Thank you Gurudev.\n\nYour Servant\nAbhiram Das"

I strive to embody the qualities you instill in us: humility like a blade of grass, tolerance like a tree, and offering respect to others without expectation.\n \n The recent Kartik yatra 2025 was life-transforming for me, seeing how much you love Krishna and are absorbed in Krishna. Please bless us to get a little of that attraction to Krishna. This humble soul is waiting for your mercy for more than a decade now, hopefully this year I may be able to get connected to you more authentically.\n \n Your absorption in chanting and kirtan/katha inspires me, granting strength to overcome anarthas impurities.

Through your vani, we are understanding spiritual subject matter properly.\n\nWe are always attached to material sense gratification, but through your vani, you cut down our attachments. An Acharya is one who teaches through example, and by your example, we have learned to be grateful and humble in every situation.\n\nI heard one incident from your life from HG Vrindavan Prabhuji when you were going to give a lecture at one place. There, all the shoes and chappals were scattered here and there, and you gave your beadbag to HG Vrindavan Prabhuji. He entered the hall, but you didn\u0027t. A long time passed, so Prabhuji came to see what you were doing. You were arranging all the shoes and chappals with your hands nicely so that you wouldn\u0027t cross them by putting your legs.\n\nIn that same lecture, HG Vrindavan Prabhuji asked why you did that. You then told another story: once, a Mataji saw you sitting in excitement and threw her sandals/shoes here and there to come to you. You noticed that and in a very grave voice, you spoke, \"Why did you do that?\" That Mataji didn\u0027t understand, then you further spoke, \"Can you imagine your life without chappals? So much service they offer to you.\" So, you even see the service offered by non-living things, as in the spiritual world, everything is cetan, everything has life.\n\nAfter hearing this incident, I was amazed.\n\nYou often quote the verse of Sikshtakam in your lectures, \"trinad api sunichena....\" Without following this verse, one cannot chant the holy name properly and constantly, and you, through your life, teach us how to live this verse practically.\n\nI am remembering one incident which shows your quality of tolerance, which I heard in the lecture of HG Vrindavan Prabhuji. Once, a devotee offered you a garland which had ants in it, and you were singing Jai Radha Madhav. Even though red ants bit you, you were still so absorbed in singing Jai Radha Madhav that you didn\u0027t notice.\n\nWhile I am writing, I am remembering so many things, but I need to stop.\n\nThere are so many incidents and stories of yours through which you teach us all the 26 qualities of a true devotee.\n\nOh Gurudev, please, please accept this ignorant fool, attached to materialistic sense gratification, as your insignificant servant. I don\u0027t have any qualifications to even write this offering for you. What is my qualification to speak or write about great souls? But just for my own purification, I have made this attempt to write this offering.\n\nYour insignificant aspiring servant and beggar of your mercy,\nAbhishek"

Whenever I feel low in my spiritual life, just one sentence from you inspires me much and elevates my consciousness. Your classes are very potent with realizations, compassion for us, and love for Krishna. You always teach us through your classes and personal example the life of an ideal devotee.\n \n 1. **Gratitude**: You always put a lot of emphasis on gratitude. I remember in most of your classes, you say, \"Gratitude is the womb of all qualities; without gratitude, we are dead.\" You have so much love for your spiritual master, so much so that you are ready to sacrifice your life. During the days of New Vrindavan, you suffered a lot through the pains and freezing cold. This shows your complete surrender and dedication to your spiritual master\u0027s instructions. Many times, I often take gratitude on a theoretical level, but in one class, which was my first offline class in Chowpatty from you, you were mentioning that gratitude doesn\u0027t just mean saying \"thank you\"; it means acting on it in reciprocation with whatever is done for us. You gave an example of HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj, how he sacrificed for SP.\n \n 2. **Enthusiasm**: You put a lot of focus on enthusiasm being a very special quality in devotional service. Enthusiasm with patience is a very good combination for Bhakti for the development of faith in one\u0027s KC.\n \n 3. **Humility**: In every lecture of yours, you give a lot of importance to humility because it\u0027s the quality which attracts the heart of Krishna and Vaishnavas. If we are humble, then progress is very fast, as there will not be any offenses.\n \n Your dealings with your godbrothers attract others\u0027 hearts and teach us lessons which are beyond any sadhana and hearing. Your affectionate nature and concern for each and every devotee are exemplary.\n I am just an insignificant servant, trying, failing, trying again and again to somehow or other serve in my small capacity. But if you desire and are pleased by my little endeavor, then it is success. Your pleasure means my superiors should be pleased with me. I will try to follow their footsteps in any circumstances, as they represent you and your instructions.\n Please bestow your causeless mercy upon me.

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna,\n Dear Guru Maharaj,\n \n You are ‘The Most Ideal’ in all aspects. Whether it is your chanting, giving a class to a few devotees or to 12,000 devotees together, or offering a simple flower or lamp to Their Lordships. In one of your lectures, you mentioned ‘Bhakti’ in one word. You said that ‘Bhakti’ means ‘Absorption,’ and throughout all the various aspects of your life, you show us what absorption really means.\n \n If we consider the time you spent physically with Srila Prabhupada, it was very little. You had hardly a few interactions with Srila Prabhupada. But somehow, many times you associated with him through vani, books, or perhaps through dreams or some other mediums. Through your words and actions, we get to see how strongly you are connected with Srila Prabhupada and the entire parampara. In your classes, we learn about the deep affection you have for Srila Prabhupada and our acharyas. When we hear your classes, we get some glimpses of that deep affection. The way you narrate the pastimes is truly extraordinary. They have helped me in various aspects of my life.\n \n I still remember during the lockdown, after one of the online classes, we stayed back in the meeting and thought to ask for prayers for our preaching. We did that, and you blessed us. In that batch, we received wonderful devotees at our center. Many of them have become very good leaders now. This year, I am again praying at your lotus feet to bestow your blessings on our tiny preaching endeavors.\n \n In my life, I have committed many mistakes, but one of the biggest mistakes I feel I have committed is that when there was an initiation interview for the first time, I said ‘No’ to taking initiation, as I was not feeling ready for it. It was the year 2022, and the initiation was supposed to happen in 2022 itself, but it happened in 2025. So, I don\u0027t know when it will happen for me now. But I request you to kindly shower your mercy on me and initiate my spiritual journey.\n \n Thank you very much, Maharaj, for everything you have given us. I am very grateful to you. Kindly forgive me for disobeying your instructions multiple times. It will take so many lifetimes for me to come to the platform of following your instructions.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Abhishek Zargad"

They explained to you that they had some concerns with management. So you immediately called me into your room in their presence. You then asked me to explain what problems they had with ISKCON Kolkata management. Then they mentioned that they had no problems with ISKCON Kolkata management, but they had problems with the ISKCON Bureau and ISKCON GBC.

        "Your Offering ":  "My dear Guru Maharaj, please accept my humble obeisances.\n I am very grateful for your lectures and what you said, that my personal instructions are in your lectures, and also your each action or movement is an instruction. So I am trying to follow that.\n \n 1. In one talk, HG Amogh Leela prabhu asked you that Maharaj, why you don\u0027t have your deities? Then you replied him that, \"My personal deities are my beads.\" And then he said that you change your bead bag on a daily basis, as in ISKCON we change deities\u0027 dress daily and keep a clean bead bag. So I am really inspired by hearing this, that the holy name and beads are the personal deities of each individual devotee, and we should respect them like deities only.\n \n 2. Today I was hearing your lecture in which you were narrating the Kaliya Naag story, and in that, you said that Krishna forgave Kaliya Naag and said to him that now Garuda death personified for snakes will not touch you because my lotus feet impressions are there. By seeing them, Garuda will not touch you. Then you said that the Tilak on a devotee\u0027s forehead also compares to the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krishna. And Yamraj gave orders to his servants, \"Don\u0027t bring to me who chanted even once Lord Krishna\u0027s name.\" Then what to say about those who are Krishna\u0027s devotees?\n \n 3. HG Vishwaroop prabhuji was telling that Maharaj told them that we should give an asan to each paraphernalia which is used in the Lord\u0027s service because these are all Lord Balaramji\u0027s expansions in the form of that object. So he told that we should give an asan to the sound box till the time it is in an active state or in service.\n \n So in this way, I am trying to focus on each statement and considering it as a personal instruction from you, Guru Maharaj, and trying to follow that as far as possible.\n \n One time, I discussed this point with HG Antardweep prabhu and said that we can list down Guru Maharaj\u0027s statements or actions like paying dandavat to Srila Prabhupada and offering flowers to the deities, serving and honoring prasad. In all these actions, your mood is always absorbed in thought of Krishna. And also, you said many times, \"How can I serve all of you by being a spiritual guide?\" We can follow and apply these in our daily routine life, and in this way, we can follow your instructions as far as our best possible way on a daily basis and keep remembering you.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, please bless me on this auspicious occasion of your appearance day. As we heard that on appearance day, one is simply in a giving mood, so please give your blessings and mercy so that I can imbibe even a drop of good qualities from your ocean of good qualities.\n \n Please forgive me for not being able to follow your basic instruction strongly, that is, attentive chanting and the four regulative principles. I am just completing the rounds grossly but not subtly following the four regulative principles.\n \n Thank you very much, Guru Maharaj, for accepting me as your disciple even though I am not qualified.\n Your servant,\n Achintya Balaram Das"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n Wishing you a very happy 75th Appearance Day!\n As this is such a special milestone, the first and foremost thing I want to say is — “Thank you.”\n Thank you for impacting my life in such a deep and transformative way. Thank you for touching the lives of my wife, my daughter, my parents, my sister, my brother-in-law, my sister-in-law, and so many other struggling jīvas all over the world.\n In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 8.7.44, there is a verse glorifying Lord Śiva:\n tapyante loka-tāpena\n  sādhavaḥ prāyaśo janāḥ\n  paramārādhanaṁ tad dhi\n  puruṣasyākhilātmanaḥ\n “It is said that great personalities almost always accept voluntary suffering because of the suffering of people in general. This is considered the highest method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone’s heart.”\n Whenever I remember the story of how an Indian immigration officer once denied you entry, saying, “We already have enough beggars,” and how your response was so humble and full of compassion — that one day, you would do good for the people of India — I feel deeply moved. Despite immense hardships and personal inconvenience, you went on to establish so many wonderful projects for the welfare of society, such as free meal programs, the Barsana Eye Camp, Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Govardhan Ecovillage, and many more.\n Like Lord Śiva, you have prioritized relieving the suffering of others, even at the cost of your own comfort. At an age when most would prefer to rest and minimize travel, you continue to tirelessly travel the world to give your valuable association and share Krishna katha with everyone.\n One special quality I want to highlight today is your unique way of sharing Krishna consciousness — much like Śrī Nārada Muni. You can connect with people from all walks of life, from simple village ladies cooking rotis during yātras to highly educated IIT graduates. Your words carry a divine potency that can transform anyone’s life if they simply hear from you.\n In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 11.26.26, it is stated:\n tato duḥsaṅgam utsṛjya\n  satsu sajjeta buddhimān\n  santa evāsya chindanti\n  mano-vyāsaṅgam uktibhiḥ\n “An intelligent person should therefore reject all bad association and instead take up the association of saintly devotees, whose words cut off the excessive attachment of one’s mind.”\n Your words indeed cut through material attachment and awaken devotion.\n Whether speaking compassionately for hours with a humble watchman guarding the Salesforce tower or inspiring a chief executive of Barclays Bank in London — who, after hearing you for just 20 minutes, sold a $10 million property to the devotees for only $0.5 million — your presence and words can melt even the most astute and financially shrewd hearts. He said, “If this is how these Hare Krishna people are, give them the building.”\n Just as Śrī Nārada Muni delivered Mṛgāri the hunter, you have gone even further — delivering not only people involved in animal killing or material life but also extending compassion to animals and plants themselves. Through Govardhan Ecovillage, you have inspired the care and service of cows, bulls, sheep, donkeys, birds, chickens, and even thousands of plants — all connected to Krishna’s service.\n On this most auspicious day, I once again thank you from the core of my heart and pray for your mercy — that I may serve the Vaiṣṇavas, Guru, and Krishna with even a fraction of the selflessness you have demonstrated all these years.\n I also pray to Śrī Śrī Rādhā Madan Mohan to bless you with a long, healthy life and ever-increasing spiritual strength.\n Your servant,\n Acyuta Chaitanya Dās"

All glories, all glories to You, Śrīla Prabhupāda and Gaurāṅga.\nWishing you a very happy and joyful 75th appearance day and Vyāsa Pūjā. Thank you for appearing in this world, to extend Your causeless mercy to inspire and show us the real home, and real path to our supreme beloved Lord Kṛṣṇa.\nThe purity and loving compassion, combined with the boundless mercy of Your divine grace, envelops us like an endless wave of Your deep love when You deliver Kṛṣṇa Kathā. One such wave of love struck me profoundly when You narrated the appearance of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The impact of that wave was so profound that I was swept away into the depths of Yamunā, as Nanda Mahārāja desperately searched for the drowning newborn Kṛṣṇa. As You narrated, I was immersed in the pastimes. That day, my heart clearly guided me to seek shelter in this divine personality. Thank You for sending that wave of love and carrying me under the wave of Your boundless mercy and divine affection, dear Guru Mahārāja. I was drowning in material suffering, unaware that I was trapped in an unimaginable and intricate web of inter-coiled miseries.\nSince then, dear Gurudeva, it is only Your words that have been working for me, and nothing else. I have been tossed from one wave of suffering to another, not even knowing that I am suffering, but this time, I am beginning to realize that I am indeed experiencing suffering.\nYour classes have the remarkable ability to uncover deeply rooted material miseries and perform precise surgery. I can feel Your presence in everything. Some anarthas are so profound that hearing Your words has helped me understand that they are not favorable for the soul.\nAfter a series of oceanic tides splashing and tossing me, one day, Your vāṇī echoed, “To the degree you have expectations, to that degree you suffer when those expectations are not met.” I realized that we shouldn’t expect anything from anyone. This realization lifted me out of the suffering ocean and onto the surface of a beautiful island of detachment.\nWhile I was chanting, my restless mind wandered over incidents, inflicts, and pulled me back to the ocean of justification, blame, and victimization. One day, with Your love, Your vāṇī echoed again, this time sternly, “Stop your chanting. Go to the altar and pray to Lord Caitanya, Lord Rādhā Madan Mohan for the well-being of the person who is coming and disturbing us while we are chanting.” As an innocent child, when I followed it, I was surprised. It took me back to a new beautiful island of forgiveness. This island is far superior to the one called detachment.\nBut wait, dear Gurudeva. Why does Your vāṇī echo again and again? Why do You come to save me every time? I pondered why You care so much about this wretched person like me. Each time You come, Your soothing balm of Your vāṇī, the breeze of Your glances, the soothing hugs when we meet, and the memorable interactions remind me of Lord Caitanya, who never leaves anyone—not just me, but all living entities.\nYou are that divine and magnanimous personality who touches simple people to celebrities. Your lectures are enough to spark a new revolution for challenged societies to return to Goloka.\nYour kīrtans are as powerful as Your vāṇī. They flood us with an overwhelming wave of love and affection.\nYour projects like annual Kārtik Yātras, Ulta Dunga Junction, Govardhan Eco Village, Bhakti Center, and Bhaktivedanta Hospitals create beautiful islands for all types of people to immerse, refresh, be cured, and emerge in the bliss of feeling the love of Lord Kṛṣṇa.\nAbove all, dear Gurudeva, as You said in Your vāṇī, anyone who comes to yātra can make tremendous progress in devotion, which would not have been possible even in millions of lifetimes. I am deeply grateful for the yātras that have allowed all of us to repair and redirect our focus on Lord Kṛṣṇa.\nWhat can a humble, ordinary, and low-class person like me offer You, dear Mahārāja? I will only try and try to be an instrument of Your beloved mission of serving Your Spiritual Master. I will strive to follow and serve Your mission.\nOn this auspicious day, I pray to all the Vaiṣṇavas, Śrīla Prabhupāda, our ācāryas, Ṣaḍ Goswāmīs, Śrī Śrī Nitāi Gaura Chandra, Pañca-tattva, Śrīman Mahāprabhu, Śrī Śrī Rādhā Madan Mohan, and Śrī Lakṣmī Narasiṁha Deva, Śrī Śrī Rādhā Govinda Deva, and Śrī Śrī Rādhā Gopinātha to bestow upon You long life, good health, energy, and bliss in Kṛṣṇa Prema, and may I eternally in some way serve You, dear Guru Mahārāja.\nWith deep gratitude!\nYour insignificant beggar,\nAcyuta Kumāra Dāsa"

You have shown that bhakti is not a solitary endeavor, but a relational one, rooted in humility and care for all living beings. Your heart beats for Brajwasis.\n\nFor me, you have been the merciful hand that pulled me from the darkness of illusion. You have taken my insignificant life and given me a glorious purpose: to read, imbibe, and distribute Srila Prabhupada books. It is by your grace that I have been serious and got the courage to commit myself to the spiritual path after reading “The Journey Home” book.\n\nI pray today for your well-being.

But your life is filled with examples. In every situation, you were looking for the essence behind it. Your friend\u0027s untimely death because his car skidded—you pondered about the uncertainty of life. Proposal from Irene—you contemplated the path led by great souls throughout history. Just sitting on the bank of the Ganges, you learned so much, without a single lecture or class, because of your hunger to see the essence behind it. Deadly passage of Istanbul, one night with a mongoose—just by reading that incident, one can feel horrified, but you were so grateful to the mongoose for teaching you patience. After one month of fasting, when you were about to break your fast, one monkey jumped and took away everything. A few peanuts fell, but another monkey came and not even a single nut was spared. Anyone can feel frustrated at such an incident, but you saw such a beautiful lesson: Material acquisitions are like peanuts in comparison to the spiritual treasure. How in material life people are lying, crying, and dying for a few of those peanuts… and there are endless examples in \"Journey Home.\" Every situation became an opportunity to deepen your spiritual wisdom and strengthen your connection with Kṛṣṇa. Thank you, Guru Mahārāja, for teaching by your example how to look for the essence in every situation. I beg at your lotus feet to bless me with strength to cultivate such spiritual vision, so that I don\u0027t get carried away by external situations but can seek the essence, learn the lesson, and gratefully thank Kṛṣṇa in every situation.\n\nys,\nAdishyam Das"

And this also shows that you were already quite and wise because you knew who the true Guru was and who could lead you to the right path, and that was our Srila Prabhupada, who showed everyone the path to Krishna not through miracles or powers, but through love.\nJai Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour love for Sri Vrindavan Dham  Your love for the people of Brij and compassion for all living beings, your humility, your perspective on every situation, your gratitude, and your deep connection with Sri Radha Gopinatha—these were the qualities that attracted me towards you. A devotee was explaining that communication doesn\u0027t just mean talking, but also listening. The way you listen patiently to everyone teaches us the true meaning of communication. And especially your understanding of how a community of devotees should be, how to move forward in devotion together, how to live in unity—all this especially attracted me to you. But the worry is how I will be able to please you because I am constantly worried that I am unable to surrender to Krishna, and that I cannot do anything properly unless Krishna is at the center. Srila Guru Maharaj, I cannot understand how to love Krishna, how to serve Him, how to please Him, and I am also saddened that I am not able to perform my duties properly.  I\u0027m not doing it, and I feel embarrassed about it. But now I\u0027m so tired of trying that I\u0027ve given up. I feel hopeless. Please suggest a way out.\n\nDespite knowing that Shila Prabhupada is my grandfather, you are my teacher, and he will never be pleased with such cowardly behavior, I still haven\u0027t been performing my duties properly. My mind has become so restless that I can\u0027t control it at all, and I don\u0027t know what to do, Guru Maharaj. Everything is going wrong.\n\nMaharaj, I want to see you more often, but it\u0027s rare to see you from where I live. I\u0027ve been waiting for you to come to Ujjain for ages, but I\u0027m so degraded that you only come to Madhya Pradesh once a year. This time, I got permission from my parents to go to Ujjain, but I didn\u0027t get a chance to have your darshan you. I won\u0027t get another chance to see you again, but if you bless me, it\u0027s definitely possible. I\u0027ll be waiting for you.\n\nWe  I pray to Lord Narasimha for your good health so that you can carry out Srila Prabhupada\u0027s orders well. I am a lowly soul and have no power to do anything for you, but it is the power of prayer that will help you accomplish your mission.\n\nYour unworthy daughter,\nBhaktina Aditi Krishna Bandhu,\nAshok Nagar Madhya Pradesh\""

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurudeva,\nThis is a very special year – the 75th year of your divine appearance on the planet. Right from your childhood, it was clear that while you were in this world, you were not of this world. The qualities of love, compassion, and humility were natural in your personality ever since you were very young. Your deep desire to find the truth led you on a journey, a journey where you not only found the purpose of your life but also helped millions of others find theirs. You faced so many hardships on this journey, including serious dangers to life, but you never stopped or thought of returning because your heart was always taking you to the place where you eternally belong – Vrindavan. Your love for Vrindavan is unparalleled, and this love and compassion have manifested in the form of GEV, giving everyone a chance to access Vrindavan dham in a way they can relate to. Year after year, in a tireless manner, you have been serving to fulfill the desire of your spiritual master, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, to spread the message of Lord Chaitanya, especially in western countries. Despite your health challenges and advancing age, your enthusiasm to share the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu never fades but only keeps growing, which is nothing but a testimony of your love and surrender to your Guru Maharaj. You are willing to give your life and soul to help devotees take up this message very seriously and surrender their lives at the lotus feet of your spiritual master. Every lecture, every instruction of yours is like an expression of your love for your Guru Maharaj and Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. This year\u0027s yatra was very special, at the foothills of Giriraj Govardhan. Your love for Vraja dham was easily seen in your kathas, as well as your interactions with Vrajavasis, who love you like one of their own. I want to express my sincerest heartfelt gratitude to you for giving us a tiny part of the love that you have for the dhamas and dhamavasis.\nI am a worthless aspiring servant of yours, and despite my so many shortcomings, I only see hope knowing your infinite compassion for all fallen souls. On this most auspicious day of your appearance, my prayers to the Lordships and Srila Prabhupada are to bestow good health and long life to you so that you keep sharing their love with the world through your instructions, your dealings, and example. I hope to be a speck of dust at your lotus feet with the only desire being to have no other desire but to serve your lotus feet.\n\nYour Aspiring Servant,\nAditya Malhotra\nDelhi"

The way you deal with your godbrothers is so heartwarming. Your lectures are always centered around cultivating the proper mood, not just doing things mechanically.

You also told that being a servant is a very, very deep subject; it is the conclusion of our entire Vedic literatures.\nSomehow, by your causeless mercy, you have awarded this fool the title of dās. I simultaneously feel so grateful and so unworthy to have such a responsible position.

Your visit in April for the Harvard Divinity School program, followed by your two visits in September — to meet Ambarish Prabhu and to grace the grand celebration of Srila Prabhupada’s 60th Arrival Anniversary — were truly transcendental moments for all of us.\n While the scriptures teach that vani-seva surpasses vapu-seva, for a fallen soul like myself, it felt like the greatest blessing to personally receive your causeless mercy during each of your visits. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for accepting my humble services.\n One of the most cherished moments of my life was when you mercifully named my Deities as Sri Sri Radha Gopijanavallabha during your April visit — the very Deities you first served even before meeting Srila Prabhupada. That sacred moment is forever etched in my heart, and I remain deeply grateful for your kindness and blessings.\n Having witnessed your humility and your mood of serving the Vaishnavas both in Boston and DeLand, Florida, I have gained complete conviction that you are the true embodiment of trinad api sunicena.\n Thank you, Maharaj, for so kindly accepting me. I pray that I may always serve you and Srila Prabhupada with faith, sincerity, and devotion throughout my life.\n Your most insignificant servant,\n Ajita Govinda Das"

My life has become transformed by coming in contact with you. You are distributing love of God far and wide, giving people the actual happiness they are looking for. You are a living Bhagawat. Your lectures touch the heart and answer all questions. You give wonderful insights on deep spiritual matters with your great realizations. I want to be the servant of your servants eternally. You teach this principle in your lectures, very mercifully. You extend yourself so much, in spite of health problems, just to distribute Krishna consciousness, out of love and compassion. Your heart is filled with bhakti. Krishna says, \"Bhaktya Mam abhijanati.\" You practice and teach this, how we should engage in loving devotional service with great determination and sincerity.\n\nYou kindly teach the principle of\nTrnad api sunichena\nTaror api sahisnuna\nAmanina manadena\nKirtaniya sada Harih\n\nYou always focus on chanting Hare Krishna Mahamantra very sincerely, from our hearts, serving Vaishnavas, and making the order of Guru as life and soul.\n\nI am a fallen fool Guru Maharaja. The dust of your lotus feet is the only hope.\n\nYou are inspiring people all over the world to chant and sing Hare Krishna. In America, so many clubs and societies are chanting Hare Krishna. They come to India also for visits. You have inspired so many of your disciples and other devotees to wonderfully spread Krishna consciousness all over the world.\n\nBy so many examples, you showed the power of unity, love, and cooperation, with Krishna in the center, with Prabhupada and Guru\u0027s service in the center.\n- By your inspiration, Chowpatty devotees unitedly distributed maximum books in the December Marathon.\n- Kartik Yatras. They are historic; such yatras are never seen before, as far as I can see. Over 12,000 devotees, many hundreds from foreign countries, Russia, USA, Africa, etc. First-class feast prasadam cooked for everyone for around 8 days. Over 150 buses for visiting holy places. Excellent management. All devotees chanting, dancing, and many crying out of ecstasy. They pay attention to so many details, due to their bhakti, to make devotees comfortable. You show how we should serve Vaishnavas. You are very dear to Lord Krishna and Prabhupada.\n- Govardhan Eco Village. You showed how a Krishna conscious community should be: simple living, high thinking. Millions of devotees visit there and find peace of mind and connect with Krishna.\n- Devotees from Chowpatty are very big donors for TOVP and Prabhupada\u0027s places in Kolkata.\n- Your disciples are humbly leading so many projects all over the world.\n\nChowpatty is a small temple with a big number of devotees with very big, compassionate hearts.\n\nYou kindly teach that a devotee should not hear criticism of another devotee or Lord, and should never engage in politicking. These destroy the devotee community and the faith of devotees.\n\nAnd you teach that we should serve under the ISKCON Authorities; that\u0027s how we please Guru and Srila Prabhupada.\n\nPlease bless that I can become your loyal servant of servant.\n\nYour servant\nAkash Khandelia\nISKCON Ujjain"

May this meager offering find favor in Your eyes, Srila Prabhupada and Their Lordships. \n \n It all started with ‘don’t think it is another year, another yatra’. For a person like me, I couldn’t comprehend this at the first, second, or the hundredth time, and it was alarming in my mind continuously throughout the yatra after every few minutes, even after coming back. \n \n And then one fine day it made me realize how much compassion and humility I had been lacking, when I recalled the yatra days. Something that became clearer through certain moments that unfolded along the way. And this phrase didn’t unfold here; it unfolded more when I realized the lessons I’ve learned from last year’s yatra. \n \n Each yatra teaches me more than I can ever put into words. \n \n I am profoundly, endlessly grateful to have witnessed that kirtan, when you asked us to raise our voices ten million times louder and offer it back to Krsna. \n That sacred moment, that precious time, will remain forever in my heart. In it, I was completely lifted into another world. \n \n Even now, I find it hard to believe it, whenever I reflect on how Your divine, merciful Maha Maha found someone as unworthy and undeserving as me. \n All that has found me has come solely through the causeless mercy of the devotees, whose compassion and love is far greater than anything I could ever hope to merit.\n Even today, it feels like a sacred dream, one before which my heart can only bow, learning slowly to receive it with complete surrender and trembling gratitude. \n \n And as You say, because of the whirl of Maya, \n this is so true; I generally take the great things to be ordinary and ordinary things as great. Please bless me that I should not be trapped into this. \n \n Guru Maharaj,\n Please bless me that I may articulate my etiquette well, deepen my Sadhana, follow Srila Prabhupada’s instructions. Please bless me to become a servant. Please bless me I should be conscious enough. Please bless me that I may refrain from speaking of mundane matters and utilize more and more time in hearing and chanting the glories of Their Lordships. \n \n Please bless me that I must not keep any priority before Krsna, and Krsna remains the prime priority over any other priorities. \n \n Please bless me that I shall be more determined to be a servant of the servant. \n \n I bow in gratitude for Your infinite mercy and love towards me, a mere fool. \n Please allow me to abide eternally in Your protection and in the shelter of Your devotees. \n \n Your aspiring servant,\n Akriti"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna,\n Please accept my humble obeisances, Guru Maharaj. I wish you a very happy 75th appearance day, Guru Maharaj. Please accept the following humble offerings unto your lotus feet by your insignificant servant.\n \n Firstly, like father, like son.\n His Holiness Bhakti Rasamrit Swami Maharaj gave a lecture on Srimad-Bhagavatam 2.10.29 at Chowpatty, and I was attending the lecture online. During the class, as the camera zoomed out, what I saw was truly inspiring. I saw you sitting near the door of the altar, listening to the entire session of Maharaj. This incident reminds me of your Guru Maharaj, Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who also used to sit and listen to lectures from his disciples. It gave me a feeling of \u0027like father, like son\u0027. You sat through the lecture till the end. I pray to the Lord to grant me a drop of this quality of hearing patiently. Also, in many of your lectures, you mention the speaker\u0027s name and what they have said in their lecture, showing how much you love to hear about Krishna Katha.\n \n Secondly, Guru Maharaj, you make your lectures more realistic by incorporating sound effects, such as the breaking down of trees and various animal sounds. This enhances the Hari Katha, making it sweeter, and your sense of humor adds to the nectar. Thank you for providing such enriching lectures that bring us closer to Krishna.\n \n Thirdly, the mood of prayers.\n While reading \"The Journey Home\", many times I came across incidents that showcased your intense prayer mode to the Lord. Your prayers at Kashi Vishwanath... \"My Lord, I long to know You and to love You. Please show me the path I must follow.\" You didn\u0027t know it was Mathura and Janmashtami, but you reached there with your friend Gary. I can\u0027t even imagine or feel the intensity of your prayers. But those words of prayer make me numb. Whenever I read the book and come across such prayers, I wish I could have even a bit of that mood.\n \n Fourthly, sacrifice and Maa Ganga\u0027s reciprocation. Last but not the least, from \"The Journey Home\", I came to know how much you loved your dearest companion, Harmonica, and how you dipped it into the Ganga just because it was demanding your full attention. And to move ahead in your spiritual path, you sacrificed it. And after that, Maa Ganga revealed to you the highest thing - Hare Krishna Mahamantra. This incident touched me a lot. As your Harmonica was your only companion from the beginning, but you left it for a higher purpose in your life. I learned how important it is to be detached from one\u0027s dearest things to move ahead in spiritual life.\n \n There is much more to glorify the qualities about you, but due to my shortcomings and limitations, I could put forward this much as an offering to you on this most auspicious occasion of Vyas Pooja. I pray unto your lotus feet that may I even get a drop of such great qualities in my life. I pray to Sri Sri Radha Govind Dev Ji for your good health because we need you, Guru Maharaj. The conditioned souls like me need you ❤️\n Your Servant 🙏\n Akshita"

I remember every time you give a class, you beg us to chant attentively, sincerely, begging the holy name in the mood of servant of the servant. You request us from your heart to follow trnad api suni cena… Oh Master! I beg you to please give me strength to follow your instructions. Let my heart be surrendered to your and Krishna\u0027s lotus feet.\n \n Oh My Master! Vaisnava seva is your heart. You do not like a Vaisnava to be offended even mentally. Not just for Vaisnavas, but your heart flows for each and every living being, and that’s why you are constantly preaching the glories of the Lord and inducing everyone to chant. When, oh my Master, will I leave this judgmental mentality and stop offending devotees?\n \n Oh My Master! You have given such strong association of devotees, which is a sure path Back to Godhead. They are caring like you, loving like you, merciful like you, faithful and loyal like you, non-offensive like you, and full of compassion like you. Yet my heart doesn’t surrender fully to their service.\n \n On this auspicious day, oh My Master, I beg and cry for your mercy and strength to follow your instructions strictly. I am struggling with my anarthas; without your mercy, it is impossible to overcome them and be established in service of the Lord. I have felt your divine presence every time I am attacked by anarthas, but have neglected your request. Please forgive me. Please help me, my Master. I am very weak.

With your boundless compassion, you have accepted me as your daughter. Your teachings on compassion and love for all living beings have inspired and guided me in many ways. You have shown us how to serve with humility, care for others selflessly, and see Krishna’s presence in every soul. I pray at your lotus feet to give me strength to imbibe these qualities and aspire to dedicate my life to please you and the devotees.\n \n A couple of pastimes that have truly inspired me.\n \n The first pastime is from The Journey Home when Radhanath Swami Maharaj speaks about a spiritual master. When he visited Rishikesh and meditated on the banks of the Ganges, sitting on a rock that was 20 feet above the water, he observed many objects being swept along in the current of Mother Ganges—leaves, flowers, uprooted trees, a dead buffalo, and even human corpses. The flow of the Ganges carried them to the banks. Maharaj explained that the spiritual path and spiritual teacher are like the current of Mother Ganges, and the disciples are like the objects carried along by the river. If we remain faithful to the current of the holy teachings, we will be carried to the ocean of spiritual truth. Radhanath Swami Maharaj exemplifies this quality throughout his life by remaining faithful and dedicating himself completely to Srila Prabhupada, spreading the message of Krishna consciousness to the entire world.\n \n The other pastime I would like to share highlights His compassion towards other living entities. Once, while traveling in Mumbai, Radhanath Swami Maharaj’s car stopped at a traffic signal. Some beggars approached and knocked on the window, asking for food. Maharaj gently asked the person with him, “Do you have any rice puffs or pancakes to give them?” The person replied, \"No, I don\u0027t have food packets to give.\" Although they later gave the beggars some money, Maharaj was not satisfied. He spoke about how important it is to carry food packets at all times. He said, “It is very humiliating to be begging,” and then, in a softer tone, he added, \"It is even more humiliating when you do not give.\" This moment reflects Maharaj\u0027s deep compassion for all, regardless of race, caste, age, gender, religion, nationality, or economic status.\n \n The last story I would like to share is about how much Radhanath Swami Maharaj’s life impacted my father when he visited St. Louis a couple of months ago. My father loves reading books, so I gave him Maharaj\u0027s Journey Home. Before reading it, he had never noticed Maharaj\u0027s picture on our altar. But once he started reading, he was deeply moved by Maharaj’s life. Later, during a conversation about Maharaj, I took him to our altar and showed him Maharaj’s picture. Immediately, he folded his hands and said, \"You have roamed everywhere, and now you have come here to preach Bhakti to all of us and very mercifully accepted all our prayers.\" He also took notes of Maharaj\u0027s messages from Journey Home in his diary to reflect on them and relish them in the future.\n \n Thank you all for allowing me to share my offerings, and to Maharaj for showing us how to lead our lives in bhakti with love and dedication.\n \n Your eternally grateful servant and aspiring daughter,\n Amala Radhika dd\n \n His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki Jai !!"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Maharaj!\n \n Maharaj, once again this year, I offer my Vyasa Puja homage with deep gratitude and anticipation. The days I cherish most throughout the whole year are those 6–7 days of the Kartik Yatra—hearing your kathās, relishing your kirtans, and receiving even a moment of your association. Those moments nourish my heart long after they have passed.\n \n This year, however, has been spiritually challenging for me. My PhD responsibilities increased significantly, and my sādhana weakened. I could not preach or serve as much as I desired, and at times I felt distant from the devotional standards I aspire to uphold. Yet through these struggles, I realized more deeply what Srila Prabhupada has always emphasized: the material world inevitably humbles us and reminds us of our dependence on shelter. In many ways, I feel Krishna is purifying me for the future, even though the process has been exhausting.\n \n By your blessings, a beautiful and hopeful direction has entered my life. I am preparing to enter the gṛhastha āśrama, and Krishna has arranged a very suitable life partner for me. I am deeply grateful for this mercy and pray that I may live in married life according to your expectations—with purity, devotion, cooperation, and a desire to serve together. I hope that our home becomes an instrument in your mission and Srila Prabhupada’s movement.\n \n As I approach the completion of my PhD next year, I am uncertain of my next steps academically or professionally. Many directions appear, but clarity is yet to come. What I desire most is the company of devotees and service that pleases you. So I pray that whatever Krishna, Srila Prabhupada, and you have planned for me, I may accept it with gratitude, steadiness, and enthusiasm. Please bless me to remain strong in faith and to serve sincerely in whatever situation I am placed.\n \n This year is especially significant as it marks your 75th Vyasa Puja. Hearing about your 55 years of unwavering service to Srila Prabhupada’s mission has filled my heart with gratitude and reverence. By the blessings of devotees, I heard so many of your glories—your compassion, your tireless efforts, your dedication to uplift all souls, and your incredible work in making Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Mandir a spiritual home for the whole world. Your emphasis on service, śravaṇam, humility, gratitude, and Vaishnava relationships continues to shape my life deeply.\n \n Maharaj, although I am not yet initiated by you, I continue to wait with hope and faith—knowing that everything depends on mercy. Like Mukunda’s determination to wait for the Lord’s call even for millions of lifetimes, I also pray to remain patient, sincere, and enthusiastic. Whenever you feel I am ready, I pray that I may someday receive your shelter. Until then, I will keep striving to become qualified and remain grateful for whatever mercy you bestow.\n \n If there is one blessing I beg from you, Maharaj, it is this: please allow me to always remain grateful.\n Grateful for Krishna’s mercy, grateful for the devotees’ kindness, grateful for your guidance, and grateful for whatever Krishna arranges—whether pleasant or challenging. Your emphasis on gratitude has transformed my understanding of spiritual life, and I pray that this quality becomes the foundation of my journey.\n \n Maharaj, thank you for everything—your teachings, compassion, example, and your tireless efforts to manifest Srila Prabhupada’s vision. I pray that in the coming year, I can deepen my devotion, serve with sincerity, and live in a way that brings pleasure to your lotus feet.\n \n Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Your aspiring servant,\n Aman Swaraj"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Maharaj,\n I wish to thank at the core of my heart for accepting me and offering your loving shelter, though underserving to receive such mercy.\n \n I have been sustained by your vani since my budding stages of my Krishna consciousness. As you always say that I have given all my instructions in my classes, your classes truly provide all that is needed for a struggling sadhaka to navigate safely through the material world, overcoming innumerable gross and subtle obstacles, and safely reach the shores of the spiritual world and receive eternal loving shelter at Krishna\u0027s lotus feet. From your vani, I get enthusiasm and strength to rise above my shortcomings and endeavor to act and live up to your expectations.\n Though I am still struggling to make a regulation of hearing your lectures, whenever I have been able to hear, I feel KC becoming seemingly easy and natural. However, when I have compromised on hearing your vani, I find challenges and obstacles taking shape.\n \n Whatever we hear in your lectures, you are a perfect embodiment of all the principles you teach, be it humility, tolerance, dedication and surrender to spiritual master, complete absorption in Krishna in everything we do, and taste for chanting.\n \n Maharaj, we also get to see the principles you teach in your lectures coming to life in the association you have so carefully created, nurtured, and trained. Recently, in the Kartik Yatra, we got to witness the devotees carrying and applying your instructions to heart and teaching everyone who has come to participate in the yatra through their vivid example. Their service attitude blended with the mood of servant of servant, relentless enthusiasm to do everything possible and impossible to give the best spiritual experience to devotees, cooperating as one body to please you with all their Krishna-given abilities and talents, is truly a memorable and learning experience for all of us to imbibe in our hearts.\n \n Maharaj, we also got to witness a glimpse of your oceanic love for Srila Prabhupada on his disappearance. You had incessant tears of separation all throughout. By seeing how much Srila Prabhupada won your heart and the hearts of millions through his compassion as a pure representative of Lord Nityananda Prabhu, we are able to somewhat fathom the extent of Srila Prabhupada\u0027s glory.\n \n Maharaj, despite receiving unlimited good fortune in my life, I have remained stooped in gratifying my mind and senses, very shallow in my depth of Krishna consciousness due to lacking sincerity in following your instructions.\n \n Maharaj, I desperately beg your mercy and blessings so that I may become dedicated and committed in my service to superiors in a way I can please them, become sincere and serious in performing my sadhana, chanting with absorption, hearing your vani and studying Srimad Bhagavatam, develop a humble service attitude in the mood of servant of servant, and glorify devotees despite my conditionings.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Amar Kishor das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Maharaj\n Please accept my humble obeisances\n \n I feel completely unqualified to write this offering for the great mercy You have bestowed upon me, although I wasn\u0027t able to properly accept it.\n Prabhupāda would multiple times mention in his books about the importance of the spiritual master in the life of a sādhaka. In SB 1.1.8 he mentions - \"The secret of success in the spiritual advancement of knowledge is to satisfy the spiritual master and thereby to get his sincere blessings.\"\n It is only by the great inconceivable mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His Divine Internal Potency that one gets an opportunity to get the association of the bonafide representatives of the sacred Guru paramparā.\n Who can count the great fortune I have been bestowed upon - to get the association of the devotees of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the line of Brahmā, Nārada, Vyāsadeva, Madhvācarya, Mahāprabhu, the Gosvāmīs of Vraja and Śrila Prabhupāda.\n Especially Maharaj, Your life has been a life of simplicity and dedication to the call of God and pleasure of Prabhupāda and his devotees.\n The example You have set is ideal for generations to follow. Your austerities for service, dedication \u0026 determination in the face of challenges, utter humility, genuine care and love for Deities, devotees and cows is an inspiration and benchmark for us to follow.\n Your dealings with devotees - Your seniors, equals and younger ones simply charm our hearts.\n You have given us such wonderful devotees like HG Radheshyam prabhu who have put themselves in the fire of this sankirtan movement for helping conditioned souls like us to light of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.\n Your divine vāṇī is the touchstone which can transform steel-framed hearts to golden soft hearts. One can very much experience the shelter of Śrī Śrī Rādhā Kṛṣṇa while being absorbed in it. Your emphasis on the essence of bhaktī is the constant guide to bring us back from going into dangerous zones of bhaktī.\n Your emphasis of crying out the holy names offenselessly and incessantly reminds for being sincere in the great mercy coming directly from the spiritual world through the paramparā out of the causeless mercy of the Lord.\n Your contributions to set up vibrant communities of devotees in India is the seed for so many wonderful services for Prabhupāda\u0027s pleasure. You have taken so much responsibility to revive Prabhupāda\u0027s mission in the western world - a task next to impossible.\n How can we ever be able to reciprocate back to the mercy You have given?\n All we can try to do is to try our best to follow Your instructions and teachings and live a life to please Śrī Hari, Guru and Vaiṣṇavas in the humble mood of the servant of their servant.\n But this is not possible without Your mercy and empowerment.\n I have been very fortunate to receive Kṛṣṇa consciousness under the capable guidance of Your dear servant HG Acyuta Mohan Prabhu here at the holy place of Varanasi. I have also been given an opportunity to render multiple services here at our VOICE centers. Under the guidance of our superiors, we are also trying to assist in reaching out to college students in IIT BHU, BHU and helping them in becoming more Krishna conscious.\n I request You to please bless all inmate devotees, upcoming devotees and those who are engaged in serving them so that they may be able to please their superiors.\n But Maharaj, even after receiving such great benedictions, I don\u0027t take them seriously. I really need Your mercy to be able to sincerely and seriously follow this divine process of Sādhanā bhaktī.\n Maharaj, there have been countless times that I have intentionally and unintentionally, grossly and subtly disobeyed Your instructions. I pray for forgiveness at Your lotus feet and hope to be forgiven and empowered to follow them seriously.\n I am a very young devotee and do not understand what is good and what is bad for me in spiritual advancement. I pray that Your guidance may be the sun to constantly guide me through all paths by dispelling away the darkness.\n I really want to practice pure devotional service, because that is the very nature of the soul. Please bless me that I may be able to practice it and become completely purified and be able to bring a beautiful smile on the lotus faces of Śrī Hari, Guru and Vaiṣṇavas.\n \n Aspiring for Your causeless divine mercy,\n Ameya Katare"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n  Happy 75th Appearance Day, Maharaj.\n \n This is my first written offering to you. Earlier, I was not very regular or consistent in hearing your lectures. But since the last one year, I have been making a conscious effort to hear you every day. Most days, I am able to listen to a full lecture, and on days when I cannot, I at least hear a 10 to 15 minute clip so that I do not lose your shelter. This daily connection has helped me stay grounded and reminded me of my purpose.\n \n Recently, I also listened to The Journey Home in your divine voice. I had read it before, but hearing it from you, the author, was very special. It again revealed your adventure, sincerity, and seeker spirit. It showed me how Krishna has prepared you to uplift people across the world. The story itself is very inspiring.\n \n Maharaj, Krishna has given me all the required facilities and many opportunities to serve the mission of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Srila Prabhupada. The only thing lacking is my commitment.\n \n In the last few years of practicing Bhakti, I have understood why you emphasize humility so much. I see that this bodily identification in me is still very strong. Even while performing devotional activities, I sometimes think of myself as someone special or capable. This tendency pulls me away from genuine surrender. Please help me overcome this, Maharaj, so I can truly surrender to Krishna and serve in the right mood.\n \n Maharaj, I also struggle with my chanting. It takes me a lot of time to complete my rounds, and I want to improve. I am ready to make whatever efforts are needed. Please bless me so that I can chant with sincerity, steadiness, and affection.\n \n Thank you so much for everything, Maharaj.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Amit Joshi"

When I chant Hare Krishna, I utter words; when you chant, you invoke Krishna’s presence. Your attention to detail in every service for Krishna’s pleasure is inspiring.\n\n2/ Cultivate the mood of pleasing Guru and Krishna:\nYour life’s purpose is to please Krishna, a commitment evident since your childhood and strengthened after accepting Srila Prabhupada as your Guru. Stories shared by Vrindavan Prabhu in his book to glorify you mention how you delivered lectures and served even in great pain, demonstrating your unwavering desire to please Guru and Krishna.\n\n3/ Remain united as a community:\nYou lead by personal example, caring for your Godbrothers and Godsisters, attending to every need, and serving with your full capacity.\n\n4/ Enthusiasm in Bhakti to share Krishna consciousness:\nThe annual yatras, attended by 10,000–12,000 devotees, are a testament to your enthusiasm and compassion to spread this knowledge. It is very inspiring to see that you are personally overseeing every detail and delivering hours-long classes daily, even at an age when most cannot sit for minutes.\n\n5/ Never forget that Bhakti is about quality, not quantity:\nYou never compromise on quality, infusing it into every aspect of your service, stretching yourself daily to serve devotees selflessly.\n\nGiven my position, I feel unqualified to write these words and am sure I make many mistakes due to my false ego. Please forgive me.\n\nSrila Gurudeva, though I am unworthy, I rely on your magnanimity. Please accept this most fallen servant and shower your causeless mercy upon me, for without it, I have no hope.

The hall was packed, and you were just about to begin your class.\nTo everyone’s surprise, you quietly stepped down from the stage, walked through the crowd, and gently helped that devotee find a seat.

You have imbibed the essence of His Shikshashtakam in your life and follow it perfectly. The true code of conduct for a devotee’s life is found in the Shikshashtakam, but to live by it requires immense austerity. You have performed that rigorous tapasya and manifested the teachings of Lord Chaitanya in your life.Therefore, anyone who comes in contact with you is naturally attracted to your humility—a humility that is not superficial but flows from the depths of your heart. In this fast-paced world, where people hardly have time for one another and love seems distant, you have dedicated your entire life to showing compassion and love for all living beings.Maharaj, I have never seen Srila Prabhupada personally, but when I see how faithfully his disciples serve and preach, I can only imagine how truly great Srila Prabhupada must be. Maharaj, I am not a great devotee, nor do I possess such humility, but by the mercy of Srila Prabhupada and your blessings, I am trying to serve in the Krishna Consciousness movement.Maharaj, please bless me so that birth after birth, I may serve this movement in the mood of being the servant of the servant of the servant. This is my humble prayer.\n \n Your servant.\""

At that time, our daughter Parusha was about nine years old and our son Parth was just three and a half. Even at that young age, both our children were deeply touched by the divine atmosphere of the temple and by your saintly presence.\nParth would observe you with great attention and awe. He was especially inspired by your unique way of beginning a lecture — after singing the maṅgala-caraṇa, you would fold your hands, glance lovingly across the assembled devotees from one end to the other, and in that sacred silence, every heart would become still. Then, softly, you would begin your class, and the hall would fill with transcendental wisdom and love.\nAt home, Parth would imitate you with devotion. Sitting on the sofa, he would ask us to sit in front of him, fold his little hands, and slowly glance over us — expecting the same silence you inspired in the temple. When we failed to comply, he would innocently ask, “When Maharaj does this, everyone becomes quiet — why not you?” We would all laugh, then fall silent, delighting his heart.\nYour words too, Maharaj, left a deep mark on him. You often reminded us that within the temple, we are protected from Māyā, but as soon as we step out, she waits to bewilder us. After each Sunday programme, as we stepped outside, little Parth would hold our hands tightly and whisper with concern, “Papa, Māyā is standing outside — she will catch us!” That childlike faith still brings tears to our eyes and reminds us of your ever-merciful protection.\nYou have always been so affectionate toward children. Once, you lovingly placed your hand on Parth’s head, and we felt our lives were blessed forever. You instructed us to bring up our children in Krishna Consciousness as a service to the Lord. We took this instruction to heart and made it our life’s mission.\nOur daughter Parusha too has grown beautifully under your merciful guidance. She completed her engineering and MBA from reputed institutions and is now married. Although absorbed in her family life, she holds deep respect for Krishna Consciousness and tries sincerely to imbibe and share these values. She is now nurturing her one-year-old daughter with affection and care — introducing her to Krishna from her earliest days. It fills our hearts with gratitude to see this spiritual legacy flowing to the next generation, all by your divine grace.\nGuru Maharaj, out of your causeless mercy, you accepted us — though utterly unqualified — as your disciples in the year 2008. Your compassion, instructions, and personal example continue to be our guiding light.\nBy your blessings, Parth has completed his engineering from IIT Delhi and continues to chant 16 rounds daily, study Bhagavad-gītā As It Is and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, and sincerely strive to become a humble devotee. We are confident that, with your mercy and the association of devotees, both our children and our grandchild will continue to grow in Krishna Consciousness and serve Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mission with sincerity.\nGuru Maharaj, words can never express our gratitude for your boundless love and mercy. Your divine aura continues to illuminate our hearts, and your compassion sustains our spiritual journey.\nAll glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nAll glories to you, our beloved spiritual master, HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj.\nYour unworthy servants,\n\nAnand Nidhi Das\nAnandni Priya Devi Dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dearest Gurudeva,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n \nTrying to write for you feels like trying to measure the sky with a ruler; whatever I attempt falls short, yet the attempt itself feels like a blessing. Still, with a hopeful heart, I place these words at your lotus feet.\n \n A quality of you, Maharaj, that continually touches my heart is the way gratitude flows so naturally from you. You thank everyone, you uplift everyone, you make every person feel seen. Watching you, I’ve slowly understood that gratitude is not decoration in spiritual life; it is the very essence that softens the heart and makes devotion possible. This single lesson has reshaped how I look at my own journey.\n \n Your instructions during this year’s Govardhan Dham Kartik Yatra made an especially deep impression on me. I could hear from you about your journey in “The Journey Home” where you traveled through so many traditions and philosophies. When you said that “to be a servant is the conclusion of all philosophies,” it struck me very deeply. It felt like the distilled truth behind everything I have ever read or attempted to understand. To the degree we try to sincerely imbibe this spirit of service, Kṛṣṇa reciprocates and cleanses the heart. Hearing this from someone who has personally walked through those philosophies and realized their essence is an immense blessing that I still cannot fully comprehend.\n \n I remember my guide, HG Hari Bhakti Prabhu, once telling me that to be a disciple means to have the dedication to follow instructions and be accountable to the spiritual master. Those words have stayed with me like a compass to keep checking when I drift. I definitely do not walk the path perfectly, but I aspire to cultivate that spirit of responsibility, both in following the instructions given to me and in aligning my life with your teachings.\n \n You speak about cultivating the eyes of love, *premanjana-churita-bhakti-vilocanena*. I know I do not have such vision, yet by your mercy, I feel I am allowed to see glimpses of that wonderful Damodara through your eyes. Whatever little taste or inspiration I have received has come by showering myself with your Vani, not by any qualification of my own. This is something I remain deeply grateful for.\n \n Another teaching from you that continues to shape my mind is your explanation of envy and its absence in Vṛindavan. You described how in Vrindavan everyone simply wants to please Kṛṣṇa, and if someone else can render a service better, they are joyfully put forward. This simple yet profound mood is the real cure for envy. It gives me a direction for what I should actually cultivate in my own heart.\n \n Your example makes even lofty ideals feel practical. You show us that humility is not weakness, gratitude is not sentimentality, and service is not mere activity; it is identity. I want to live my life in a way that reflects even a drop of that understanding.\n \n My deepest aspiration is to embrace the mood you embody so naturally, to be the servant of the servant. I pray that this aspiration becomes real, not just something I recite, but something I ingrain. I pray for the sincerity to follow your instructions and those of your representatives wholeheartedly, without excuses.\n \n Thank you for giving meaning to every struggle and hope in my spiritual journey. Thank you for allowing me to stand anywhere near the shelter of your feet. I remain forever grateful and pray for the strength to serve your mission and your devotees with integrity.\n Your insignificant aspiring servant,\n Anand."

Your katha is magical; I myself feel part of those incidents.\n \n I wish one day to have your vapu sangha also, because I have a desire to serve you personally, because that is the only way I can get purified.

Even in this advanced age, you continue to bless us daily — joining the morning programs, chanting japa with us, and offering your deep classes every evening during Kartik Yatra for our spiritual nourishment.\n\nI was deeply moved when I saw Your Holiness absorbed in prayers before Sri Giriraj Ji. That sacred moment reminded me of your beautiful statement:\n\n\u003e “Bhakti means to observe.”\n\nToday, my heart also travels back to 2020, when we had planned to celebrate H.H. Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaj’s 75th Vyasa Puja in Surat. But the world changed then, and we lost his divine association during the pandemic. Though I am your disciple, I was fortunate to have received so many opportunities to associate with His Holiness Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaj. That loss was heavy on my heart.\n\nNow, by the Lord’s mercy, I am again blessed to witness a 75th Vyasa Puja — yours. In your presence, I feel the same warmth and compassion that I once felt with Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaj. Whenever I see you, I remember him; and when I saw him, I often remembered you. Truly, this is my great fortune.\n\nJust as one beholds a ripe mango and instantly remembers its sweetness, juiciness, and taste, in the same way, when one sees you, it is felt that you are filled with pure devotion for Sri Sri Radha-Krishna. And whoever associates with you begins to feel that divine love awaken in their own hearts.\n\nDuring Kartik Yatra, in your presence, my restless heart found calm and fullness that words cannot express.\n\nYet, Maharaj, as I look at the world today, I see so many wars, conflicts, natural disasters, and an endless storm of technology pulling hearts away from Krishna. Everything is becoming refined outwardly, but our inner connection to the Lord is fading. We appear to practice bhakti, yet often without true urgency or dependence on Krishna. Only your shelter, your mercy, can save me from this illusion.\n\nLast year, on 17th September, you kindly awarded me saffron cloth. Please bless me that I may remain truly humble, for I feel that since wearing this sacred colour, some pride has quietly entered my heart — a desire for respect and honour. But you have always taught that saffron is not for prestige, but for service, sacrifice, and dedication to Srila Prabhupada’s mission.\n\nI pray, dear Maharaj, please bless me to maintain the dignity of this dress, to stay far from the traps of lust and honour, and to develop a small drop of real taste for the Holy Name.\n\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for carrying us all with your compassion and patience. May I always remain at your lotus feet, aspiring only to serve.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nAnand Vraj Das"

Yet, despite all this engagement with people, management, and constant travel, you remain a humble servant of your spiritual master—always enthusiastic to give Kṛṣṇa, to speak about Kṛṣṇa, and to elevate the consciousness of every soul according to their capacity.\n \n As I myself grow older, I increasingly recognize my own shortcomings. I realize how difficult it truly is to deal with people\u0027s emotions in a way that does not discourage them. To represent the truth—both relative and Absolute—and yet express it in an uplifting manner that inspires devotees and the general public to come closer to Kṛṣṇa is not a simple task. But you do this constantly. You communicate with sensitivity, always adjusting your message to the time, place, circumstance, and audience.\n \n In this world—material, spiritual, and even within religious institutions—there are so many opinions, divisions, and differences. People naturally take sides, and discord often follows. To navigate this landscape of egos requires deep humility, compassion, and surrender to a higher principle. You exemplify all of these qualities. You truly represent the essence of what Śrīla Prabhupāda came to teach the world.\n \n Therefore, on this most auspicious day of your divine appearance, I place a humble request before you: please bless me so that I may become even a small representative of your mood, just as you are a pure representative of your spiritual master.\n \n I am impulsive, impatient, and easily agitated—qualities arising from the mode of passion. If I truly wish to “talk the talk” and “walk the walk” from a spiritual perspective, I must cultivate the divine qualities that you so naturally live by.\n \n My dear Guru Mahārāja, you tirelessly push forward the movement of His Divine Grace. I humbly beg for your blessings on this auspicious day so that I may become your humble instrument of will.\n \n Thank you for the kindness you have shown to me in the past, the kindness you show now, and the kindness you will show in the future.\n \n \n Hare Krishna!\n Your servant always,\n Ananda Jagannath das\n Des Moines, Iowa"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dearest Guru Maharaj,\n \n Please accept my humble obeisances, all glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n I remember this time last year when I came to your vyasa puja for the first time. I had the deep desire in my heart to take shelter of you for a few months before that, for you to be my diksa guru, and that morning my authorities at Soho Street temple had given me their blessings to pursue that course - to become your initiated disciple.\n When I arrived at Krishna Avanti School that day for the vyasa puja I felt a little out of place, a little nervous, but also excited and relieved. Excited for what was to come in my spiritual life with you, and relieved that the deep desire in the core of my heart had been acknowledged and trusted by my authorities at ISKCON Soho. Sitting inside Krishna Avanti I felt a little unqualified to be amongst such exalted devotees, fully surrendered to serving you and Srila Prabhupada’s mission, but by the end of the day, I very much felt the warm bliss of being embraced by your representatives, my family, on returning “home”.\n \n It’s funny, that day only a handful of names were pulled out of a hat to read their offerings to you. I was so new to all this at the time and I hadn’t written anything, and as I sat alongside Radhanath Swami’s disciples, I was a bit of a rabbit caught in the headlights. As they were pulling the second name out of the hat, I turned to Tripad Prabhu and said somewhat exasperatedly - “Prabhu, I haven’t written anything, please say they don’t pull my name - “ at which point XANDER HEPHER my name, boomed out across the room. Of all the possible names, and of the few that were selected at random, of course mine had been pulled out! I went up and read a small reflection I had written. It was actually such great mercy, and such great kindness. It was some reciprocation with my desire to please you and serve you, and in some sense it felt like confirmation that I was making the right decision. Thank you for always guiding me, and for always remaining with me.\n \n I still am the same uncertain individual in many ways, trying desperately to please yourself and the devotees I have the pleasure of associating with, but now, one year on, I have the great and inconceivable blessing of your eternal shelter. And so any anxieties and insufficiencies I possess are forgotten in the presence of your great mercy. Words cannot suffice to thank you for what you have done, and are doing in my life. From when I first met you last January in Govardhan Eco Village, to the present day, everything has changed. In meeting you for the first time I had my first tangible experience of what real love was, through your embrace outside Madan Mohan Temple, and through your encouragement. You have lived in my heart since then and I pray that my meditation on you may become deeper, clearer and more absorbed as I seek to purely and sincerely please yourself, Srila Prabhupada and all the Acaryas with my service. I will always try to represent you by being an example of your mood - to serve with utmost humility, honesty, and deep, deep care and compassion for all living entities. I will try, and do my utmost, to follow in your footsteps.\n \n Sometimes I long for your personal association and wonder whether it is a sentimental desire or a desire of the heart to be more intimately serving you. But I know that the deepest intimacy is in serving your instruction, and that through being situated here in the West, you are pleased by my humble attempts to propagate Srila Prabhupada’s movement to the Western people, to the best of my ability. You said that Studio 108 is working because things are being done in a mood of pure devotion, and that we must maintain. Purity is the force and preaching is the essence, and so I will do my best to continue serving here in separation from you, as purely as I can, which means following your guidance, and your instruction. Then I can give others the opportunity to one day experience the love that you have given me.\n \n On the day of my initiation, everything changed Guru Maharaj. As I walked onto the stage with my parents, my mother looked at me and said, “Go!”, gesturing towards you. I know out of the sensitivity and kindness of your heart you invited them on stage to give their blessings, and for me to offer them my heartfelt obeisances. My mother saying “Go!” towards you, felt very much as if she was willingly and lovingly handing me over to your shelter. They knelt behind me as I lay at your feet Maharaj - it was as though they offered me up to you, and I lay down at your feet. Lying at your feet is where I wish to remain. I cannot begin to express my gratitude for my parents being there, and for your kindness towards them. They gratefully received your words of appreciation on that day, thanking them for coming, and gratefully received the burfees and cookies you offered them. I feel more deeply connected to them under your shelter now, following that day that we all shared. My father says he would like to meet you to have a more personal discussion, and if that one day happens it would be so special. My mother loves you already.\n \n I only hope that for years to come I can please you more and more in service of Srila Prabhupada. That I may make you proud, and that I may become a representative of your mood and mission, wherever I may be.\n \n Your eternal servant,\n Ananda Nitai Dasa"

Your glories are incalculable, and my gratitude can never be fully expressed in words, though my heart longs to offer it to you at every moment.\n\nEach day, I am reminded of the immeasurable fortune of your association, which you so mercifully shower upon me with love and grace. I am indebted to you for noticing someone like me, lifeless, forlorn, and ignorant, and blessing me with your shelter. Without you, life feels like a path of danger and hopelessness, but with you, I feel protected, guided, and deeply loved.\n\nYou have the rare gift of seeing only the good in others. I will never forget the first time I met you in person, after you spoke on the Hawk and Fish narrative from “The Journey Home”. With hesitation, I approached you and said, “Your talk was very nice.” To my amazement, you smiled and replied, “You are very nice.” Carrying insecurities from lifetimes, I felt my heart captured by your humility and kindness. You are truly a collector of hearts—loving even those of us riddled with flaws and failures, yet guiding us as a steadfast father toward our highest potential.\n\nWhen I was engaged in transcribing your lectures, I experienced perhaps the most fulfilling service of my life. Each word I typed felt alive—like drops of nectar falling into my heart. Listening again and again, I realized your voice was not just sound vibration but a wave moving beneath the surface of my being, creating silent tremors that reshaped my journey in Krishna consciousness. Your lectures are soul-stirring; they both comfort and challenge. They soothe our restless minds with compassion, yet awaken us to urgency—reminding us to take shelter of the Supreme Lord without delay.\n\nThrough this service, I began to see bhakti not as a theory but as a living reality. I learned to recognize anarthas, not with despair but with hope, and to view them as obstacles removable through the process you so patiently explain. You taught me how to face them step by step, and how to anchor my life in the principle of following the instructions of guru and Krishna.\n\nDuring this time, my daughter was within me, silently receiving the current of your words along with me. Often, I would replay the same class multiple times, carefully catching every phrase, and I would think, “She is also receiving this.” Today, I see her as a gift of your mercy linked to you, not just through me, but through the sound of your vani that she received even before birth, nourished by the same stream of transcendental sound.\n\nOn this auspicious day, I pray that I may forever remain under your shelter, serving you in whatever small way I can, carrying your words within my heart until they blossom into unwavering devotion. Your love and guidance have captured my life completely, and by your mercy, I aspire only to be your servant, now and always.\n\nYour servant, and daughter\nAnanga Sundari devi dasi"

Your life is a living scripture, teaching us what it means to truly serve with devotion, courage, and compassion.\n \n Maharaj, through your example, you have shown that real spirituality is not found in rituals alone, but in the tenderness of the heart. Your words pierce through the layers of ego and awaken the dormant longing for Krishna within us. In your presence, we feel seen, understood, and loved as if Krishna Himself is embracing us through you.\n \n Even when life feels heavy or confusing, your teachings remind me that every struggle is Krishna’s gentle hand guiding us back to Him. You have taught me that bhakti is not the absence of pain, but the transformation of it into service and gratitude. There were moments in my journey when the path felt heavy, when faith wavered, and the heart was tested by life’s deep challenges. Yet, in those times of darkness, your voice, your prayers, and your presence became my light. Your teachings gave me strength to keep walking, trusting that Krishna’s love is working through every trial.\n \n And then, in His infinite kindness, Krishna blessed us with our two precious boys — Kishan and Kanhaya. When you lovingly performed their first grain ceremony, it felt as though the entire universe paused in reverence. Watching you offer those grains with such affection and devotion was one of the most sacred moments of my life. In that instant, I felt Krishna’s mercy flowing through you into them, blessing their lives, their souls, and their journey ahead. I will carry that moment in my heart forever.\n \n On this sacred occasion, I pray for the strength to serve this mission with sincerity and consistency. May I become a small instrument of your compassion. May my heart always remember your instructions, and may my life be an offering that brings you some happiness.\n \n Thank you, Guru Maharaj, for giving us faith when we lose ours, for showing us that love is the highest truth, and for being a shelter for so many souls wandering in darkness.\n \n With tears of gratitude and love at your lotus feet,\n Your aspiring servant\n \n Ananga Sundari Devi Dasi, Dipak, Kishan \u0026 Kanhaya"

In one of the lectures of HG Vishwaroop prabhuji, he was saying how Krishna and the divine personalities expand themselves so that people of this world can offer their devotional service. He was giving the example of Tulsi Maharani, how in the form of a plant she has expanded herself in a way that so many people can offer worship to her and receive devotional service.\n \n I was thinking in that way how you have expanded yourself in so many ways and have showered the mercy of Krishna and Guru Parampara in a way that I feel I have a path to follow where every step brings that joy and satisfaction which is ever increasing. Initially, when my wife and I had only read your books Journey Home and were in contact with senior god brothers, they had taken care of us so nicely, like one takes care of a baby. From those days until today, I feel you have provided the intensive care that I need at every step, and you have helped me walk that path in baby steps.\n \n On this glorious day of your appearance, I beg forgiveness from all the Vaishnavas for the offenses I have committed. I also beg you for the strength to follow your instructions of cultivating the humble service attitude to all the Vaishnavas, to improve my daily Sadhana, and to read Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books.\n Your Aspiring Servant,\n Anant Nitai Das NVCC Pune"

Honestly, I have no qualifications, but your causeless mercy keeps me on the path of devotional service. I am simply trying my best to please the devotees around me with whatever little capacity I have.\n \n I was reflecting on the recent Kartik Yatra. Devotees were asking me, “How was the Yatra?” I paused for a moment and replied, “Maharaj gives us a glimpse of the spiritual world.” Because truly, what greater experience can one get in life? Living in Govardhan for almost 9 days, waking up every morning to the darshan of Giriraj, being in the association of an ocean of devotees, having unlimited opportunities to serve, relishing delicious prasadam, hearing the nectarean Krishna-katha flowing from your lotus mouth, and ending the day with ecstatic dancing kirtan—\n I felt, this is what the spiritual world must be like.\n And my Guru mercifully takes us there so we may rise above material suffering.\n \n In Srimad-Bhagavatam 4.22.22, Srila Prabhupada writes in the purport:\n “To increase attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one has to accept a bona fide spiritual master, learn from him the methods of devotional service, and hear from him the transcendental message and glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”\n And you are giving each one of us these precious opportunities.\n \n Maharaj, you embody the qualities of so many great devotees described in Srimad Bhagavatam.\n \n Like Maharaj Parikshit, you are an exceptionally attentive listener. In almost every class you say, “This morning I was hearing Srila Prabhupada’s lecture,” revealing how constantly and faithfully you hear from Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Like Sukadeva Goswami, you speak Krsna Katha tirelessly, hours and hours, year after year, with unchanging dedication, depth, compassion, and ever-increasing enthusiasm.\n \n Like Narada Muni, you carry the message of the Lord everywhere, uplifting hearts and igniting devotion in all kinds of people.\n \n And like King Prithu, who cared for each citizen and created a spiritually vibrant kingdom, you have nurtured a beautiful community around Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, caring personally for devotees and guiding everyone with affection and responsibility.\n \n These qualities shine through you so naturally, Maharaj, and they continuously inspire me to deepen my own service and devotion.\n \n On this auspicious occasion, I beg for your blessings that I may faithfully follow the instructions of my authorities and rise above all faultfinding tendencies, and may I be a small instrument of compassion in the hands of Lord Sri Chaitanya.\n \n Your servant,\n Ananta Madhav Das"

These disciples are nothing but your mercy in extended form.\n Further, you gave us shelter by giving good guidance, training, and protection in the form of a counselling system. Guru Maharaj, a really dump person in the counselling system became a great, serious, sincere, and cultured Krsna Bhakta.\n Further, you gave us shelter by condensing Krsna Katha through the medium of Yatra. Yatra is a wholesome experience, where we can share our care with other associates. It gives a complete experience of how to seek shelter of Dham, how to see Dham through ears. Yatra means immense availability of Seva to please dear devotees of the Lord. What can I say more, it\u0027s the experience which keeps us focused in Bhakti throughout the year.\n Further, you gave us shelter through your extended dreams which are, of course, the dreams of our Acharya, GEV, the New Vrindavan. Such an amazing Dham you have manifested, where everyone gets the same tranquility which one gets in Vrindavan. Through this dream, you gave us ample opportunity to serve the Dham.

This seva is given by my counselor, H.G. Mukund Anand Prabhu. Although I don\u0027t have any qualification to do the same, by following his order and as your mercy, a Guru prasad \"yasya prasado bhagvat prasado...\", I want to perform this seva. Please bless me, Maharaj, with your divine knowledge and the way you eloquently speak, seeking a tinge of this quality so that I can do some good to these children who join.\n \n Apart from this, I am also conducting the Krishna Kridangan every Sunday, a weekly program where some children join. There, I speak on various pastimes of the Lord. Seeking your blessings to perform this activity in a humble state of mind.\n \n Under the guidance of our counselor, we are reading Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books for half an hour every day. We call this SPORT Srila Prabhupada Online Reading Terminus, where many devotees join and read. We started this program a long time back, and through this, I have completed all the small books. Now, we are reading Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 4. This is all happening due to your mercy, where I don\u0027t have any strength to do so.\n \n Dear Maharaj, I am completely bowled out in my grihastha life, where my wife and I have not been talking to each other for the last 6 months. She doesn\u0027t cook for me, or you can say that I really don\u0027t want anything from what she cooks. It could be my own ego, where I also don\u0027t want to put my down, nor does she. I know I should talk to my counselor regarding the same but don\u0027t have the courage to do so. My own wish is also not to resolve the issues with my wife, but I want to perform all the responsibilities properly. You know everything. Please give me encouragement so that I can pass this phase, and she should understand my feelings about me.\n \n I do these things, but still, my heart is not satisfied doing japa and other devotional activities.

Although I am unqualified to even try to describe your ocean of glories, but remembering your causeless mercy upon this insignificant servant, I will make a humble attempt. Maharaj, your life is a perfect example of how to be a perfect disciple. Although you are a self-realized soul, you never miss hearing from Srila Prabhupada even a single day. Your deep love and affection for your spiritual master reflect in your every word and action. You have given great importance in restoring and renovating places related to Srila Prabhupada’s pastimes. Starting from the renovation of Srila Prabhupada’s birthplace at Kathaltala, his first meeting place with Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur at 1, Ultadanga Junction Road, to the renovation of 26th 2nd Ave in New York, where Prabhupada started this movement, all these indicate how deeply you want to establish Srila Prabhupada in each and every devotee’s heart. This teaches me how I should strive to glorify you and Srila Prabhupada with all my actions.\n\nLike a true acharya, you always teach by your own example. You teach us how to strive for being a true servant of the servant of those who are genuinely serving Krishna. The way you deal with every single living entity shows your intense love for Krishna. You have deep love and attachment to our previous acharyas as well. Hearing about Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His associates from your lotus mouth acts as a shower of nectar in my dry heart. During the 2004 Bangladesh yatra, you gave a 6-hour long lecture on the life of Srila Narottam Das Thakur Mahashaya. Maharaj, I can never forget that lecture. After hearing the glorious pastimes of Narottam Dasa Thakur, Srinivas Acharya, Narahari Sarkar and other exalted Vaishnavas from your lotus mouth, when we visited Srikhanda, Jajigram and Katwa earlier this year, it was spiritually extremely nourishing. Recently I was hearing a lecture by HG Vraja Vihari Prabhu where he was mentioning that the primary thing you expect from your disciples is to have deep absorption in hearing and chanting. You always want us to focus on quality rather than quantity. I beg forgiveness Maharaj that I could not meet your expectations so far. Please bless me Guru Maharaj so that I can please you by sincere sadhana, by serving the Vaishnavas, co-operating with them in every endeavor and striving for pleasing Srila Prabhupada and Krishna with all my actions.

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna dear Guru Maharaj\n Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet\n All Glories to Srila Prabhupada and your Holiness.\n \n I’m very grateful and infinitely indebted to have your divine shelter in my life. As I look back into my life’s journey, it’s inconceivable how your compassion, your divine presence has transformed my life, the lives of my family members, and all of them whom I know. And yet, as a neophyte, I’m just starting to realize this aspect - considering what our incredible fortune has been in this life after traversing through 8.4 million species to connect with a bonafide Guru completely surrendered to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Guru Maharaj, I want to offer my gratitude for so many things to you. Today I am reminded of an instance from 2020 when moments of your association changed our life. During this time, my wife, Anuradha Priya DD not initiated then was battling 4th stage cancer. None of the treatments were working. She was bedridden for 8 months and doctors felt she could pass away any moment. Under this critical situation of intense pain, battling life and death, her faith was very shaky and mostly down. With two children aged 5 and 13, she had constant anxiety of separation from children which could happen any moment. The devotees of the Michigan congregation were constantly serving us with counseling, prasadam, their intense prayers, taking care of our kids, grocery shopping, and so many other innumerable ways that are beyond our comprehension. However, since we had just stepped into Krishna consciousness, this reversal in life combined with no results from any treatment and our previous misguided association acted as a deterrent to Krishna consciousness for my wife. Needless to say, I was helpless, clueless, and could not be of any service other than praying for help. It was during this time that HG Yugal Kishore Prabhu kindly arranged for a disciple meeting with you for all the devotees in the Michigan congregation over Zoom. It was a very sweet meeting where all the devotees were offering their heartfelt gratitude and seeking your blessings, and it was as if you were distributing benedictions filled with enormous love. Just seeing the exchanges filled our hearts with gratitude. When my turn came, I was blank and couldn\u0027t speak anything. At this time, HG Yugal Kishore Prabhu kindly briefed you on our family situation and requested your prayers for my wife. During this time, you spoke to her for less than a minute. You affectionately spoke to her saying - Krishna is with her in this fight and she should do the needful. You also mentioned you will pray for her. That association of a few moments was transformatory for my wife and my entire family. The care, love, and affection that she experienced gave her strength, and you instilled her faith which didn\u0027t exist moments before. Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur sings - ohe vaishnava thakur, dayaro sagor…….krishna je tomar krishna dite paro, tomaro sakati aache. Lava matra sadhu sange sarva siddhi hoye. I could see a tremendous transformation in her from that moment. Because of the power of the prayers of a pure devotee as yourself, her health immediately in 2 weeks started improving radically and she regained very close to normal health. This reboosted her faith, and she was able to continue in Krishna consciousness, and her heart was filled with gratitude for what she received. During this time, she had expressed many times her desire to serve all the congregation devotees someday who were constantly serving us. After having a healthy life for about 2 years, the cancer was back, and her health began to deteriorate in 2022. During all this time, she had an intense desire to get initiation from you and get the beads from your divine lotus hands in person. As her health continued to deteriorate, I did not know how this would be practically feasible, and I suggested that she consider online initiation as in my heart, I knew that time is running out. But she was persistent in her desire. Towards Nov 2022, we were notified about upcoming initiations in Ohio in the next few weeks. She was very excited about it, but I knew it had challenges because by this time, she had lost her mobility significantly. Just days before the initiation, as my anxiety grew on how to carry her to Ohio, we were told that you were coming to ISKCON Farmington Hills for the initiation ceremony which was a 7-minute drive from our home. This overwhelmed us with joy, and we could understand immediately it was an immense shower of mercy from your Holiness. Even better, you were coming on the occasion of your divine appearance. It was on this occasion that she got initiated. Time flew quickly, and we were on the day of initiation. During initiation, as she was trying to somehow wobble and move towards you due to low mobility, you noticed her approaching slowly, and the first thing you said on noticing her was, “I’m praying for you.” Visually, she looked way different from when you had seen her in 2020. This was due to the chemo treatment her looks had changed, but we understood - you could see the soul within and immediately identify. Guru Maharaj, this meant so much for us. After all, who are we? We are just nobody, but your love is so unconditional. Your love towards us is non-different from the love that Krishna has saksad hari twena samasta sastrair. And this is our hope, Guru Maharaj. We could be no one today, but if we could develop genuine sincere loving service towards you, then our this birth would be most successful. Going back to after initiation, 24 days after the initiation, your spiritual daughter, Anuradha Priya DD, left her body, surrounded by devotees with giriraj charanamrit, dust of Govardhan sprinkled on her body, maha garland of Sri Sri Radha Kunjabihari, Sri Sri Radha Gopijana Vallabh, and Sri Sri Radha Shyam Sundar. You were on the flight when all this was happening, but by your divine arrangement, there was HH Radha Govind Das Goswami Maharaj and HG Malati Prabhu and so many congregation devotees on a Zoom call chanting for her in the middle of the night. Our sincerest heartfelt gratitude for delivering Anuradha Priya, Guru Maharaj. As I look back, this is incomprehensible even today in my mind how this happened, but it\u0027s purely your causeless compassion by which there\u0027s a shower of unlimited mercy. Going back to the Zoom call of 2020, you showed by personal example what is actually compassion through your genuine care and affection. Having seen this, experiencing this, I realized that it\u0027s not just the words that made a difference, but your genuine pure devotion and your mood of servant of the servant in service to Srila Prabhupada. Guru Maharaj, at this point, I want to admit and beg you for something. I have to admit that I am totally unqualified to be your disciple as I don\u0027t have any devotion in my heart and I’m bereft of even a drop of the mood that you carry. I would humbly beg, clasping your lotus feet, to bestow your causeless mercy so that I can serve Srila Prabhupada’s movement birth after birth in the mood of servant of servant with genuine devotion. I want to please you, Guru Maharaj, by sincerely following your instructions. You had mentioned to senior devotees that the below five items would please you, and hence I humbly seek your blessings:\n - Going deep into hearing, chanting, and service\n - Cultivating the mood of pleasing Krishna\n - Striving to be united as a community\n - Practicing enthusiasm to share Bhakti Krishna consciousness\n - Never forgetting that Bhakti is not about quantity but about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n - Being a good example personally for the upbringing of children in a Krishna conscious way.\n \n I have so much to share because your causeless mercy is infinitely protecting and inspiring us, but I seek your blessings so that I can journal these going forward as my memory is fading away and I don\u0027t want to lose these moments.\n \n Before concluding, I want to offer my highest gratitude to you for your causeless mercy:\n - Giving me devotees in my life, especially some devotees who are constantly sustaining me on a day-to-day basis\n - Reconnecting us always with Srila Prabhupada’s mission\n - Gifting with your classes - always stressing on pure devotional service, how we can please Krishna and his devotees Vaishnav seva. In fact, your love for your God brothers and God sisters, Vrajavasis, and for all devotees in general is heart-melting and always reflects your love towards Srila Prabhupada.\n - Giving your invaluable association in Kartik yatra thru Hari Katha, Hari Kirtan, giving us the unlimited opportunity to get your divine association and the association of those whom you love, amidst your super busy schedule - you were cooking for us, you are making us realize how grateful we need to be to all those who are serving to making this yatra happen, you are showing us every moment how much you value your God brothers and God sisters and practically everyone around you.\n - Giving us unlimited opportunity to learn so much during Kartik yatra from the association of all exalted devotees around us.\n - Giving us a wonderful congregation in Michigan and enthusing us every moment.\n - Gifting us with your divine association during Sadhu Sanga this year.\n - And many more….\n \n Last but not the least, Guru Maharaj, you’re giving us so much and in fact persistently giving yourself to us despite all odds. I beg for your blessings so that one day I understand your heart and can be a menial instrument to give you pleasure in each and every thing I do, every moment to moment. I offer my sincere prayers at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Kunjabihari, Sri Sri Radha Gopijana Vallabh, Sri Sri Jagannath Baladev Mai Subhadra, Sri Sri Gaura Nitai, and Sri Sri Nitai Patita Pavan Gaurahari that they bestow you long life with good health so that you can deliver millions of souls for the pleasure of Srila Prabhupada.}}\n Your insignificant servant\n Ananta Vilas Das"

All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!\n On this most sacred and auspicious occasion of your Vyāsa-pūjā, I bow down in deep gratitude for your boundless compassion, love, and tireless service to Śrī Guru and Śrī Gaurāṅga. By your mercy alone, fallen souls like myself have received a glimpse of the light of bhakti and the shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s movement.\n Maharaj, your life is a living embodiment of humility, tolerance, and compassion. You have shown us—through your own example—how a true servant of God lives only to serve others and to bring them closer to Krishna. Your words awaken the heart; your presence purifies the atmosphere; your smile melts away the coverings of the ego. Through every kirtan, lecture, and gentle glance, you teach us what it means to love purely.\n Despite my countless shortcomings, you continue to offer unconditional kindness. You never see faults; instead, you see the soul struggling to find its way home. This vision of love and acceptance is the very essence of Krishna consciousness that you so beautifully embody.\n On this Vyāsa-pūjā day, I pray to always remain under your shelter.\n May I learn to serve with sincerity, humility, and devotion.\n May my heart become an instrument through which your instructions can manifest.\n May I never forget your mercy, even for a moment.\n And may I one day develop even a drop of genuine love for Śrī Guru, Śrī Krishna, and all living beings, as you exemplify so perfectly.\n Thank you, Maharaj, for everything—for your patience, your guidance, your prayers, and your unfathomable love. I offer this small token of gratitude, knowing it can never be enough to repay even a single drop of your mercy.\n Your servant,\n Ananya"

        "Your Offering ":  "My most respected and dearest Gurudev,\n \n My life is an example of your countless mercies, of which I can only enumerate a few.\n It was only because of your mercy that, as a young girl, I was married into a most beautiful Krishna Conscious family, to the most balanced, calm, supportive Satchitanand Das, who was completely devoted to you.\n \n You were there to bless us when Abhaycharan was born and named him too.\n Maharaj, you were there when Aradhita was born. You came to the hospital to see the 1-day-old baby, and you performed her naming ceremony too, later.\n You graced the occasion of the 50th wedding anniversary of our parents and also the 75th birthday of Sahadev Prabhu.\n You specially called up and spoke to my family when my father passed away.\n You were there to bless Aradhita and Ravi at their wedding ceremony at Jaipur.\n You have been there at every milestone of our Grahastha life, personally guiding us, showering us with immense love and care, just like a parent.\n \n My heart is full of gratitude today.\n Maharaj, your magnetic presence, your magical touch does wonders.\n I just wish to share a small observation. My mother is suffering from Alzheimer\u0027s, and now there are times when we have to introduce ourselves to her, since her memory issues are giving her a lot of trouble.\n \n Recently, when Maharaj, you came to Jaipur to bless Aradhita and Ravi as they were taking their wedding vows, you met my mother, who was in a wheelchair.\n On the wedding day too, you met her and had a long conversation with her, that I\u0027m not aware of yet.\n But the next day, as both of them were leaving, you met her again, and I was there too.\n \n My mom\u0027s eyes lit up as she had your darshan. Her face became joyful, and she kept repeating, \"Radhanath Maharaj, Hare Krishna. Radhanath Maharaj, Hare Krishna. Radhanath Maharaj, Hare Krishna.\"\n Maharaj, you spoke to her and blessed her and then stepped down the stairs to leave.\n My mother then said, \"Radhanath Maharaj, I want to....\" and she was struggling and fumbling to find words to express her desire when I noticed that she was trying to get up from her wheelchair and trying to touch your feet.\n I told Maharaj that \u0027she wants to touch your feet, Maharaj,\u0027 and Gurudev, you again stepped up on the parapet to allow my mother, who then bent down to touch your feet. You blessed her and prayed for her.\n \n My throat was choked.\n For a person whose brain cells are dying and whose memory has deserted her, the magic was that she associated the name of Radhanath Maharaj with the chant of Hare Krishna and recognized Maharaj and just kept hankering more and more for his association. This speaks volumes about the magic, the miracle in your presence, Maharaj.\n \n The most important people in every child\u0027s life are his/her parents, and Maharaj, you have blessed my parents, my children, my entire family.\n \n Maharaj, please accept my prayers of gratitude today. I have always only taken and taken and taken from you, and again, I seek another favor from you, Maharaj.\n Please pray for me so that I can slowly get more attached to serving the lotus feet of Krishna and be of service in fulfilling your desires and your vision. Let me be the most menial servant who can be used in any way that YOU desire.\n \n Your humble servant,\n [Signature]"

Whatever I have belongs to you because I belong to you, for eternity, Gurudev.\n \n At first, most of the things felt impossible to me. But the few lines you have spoken to me, and all your glances and smiles – everything is stored in my heart forever, and it makes me believe in myself.\n \n As you said once, that by having supersoul networking, you are able to understand the heart of every devotee. I know that you are personally present when your disciples remember you. There is no material situation and no geographical boundaries that can separate us, because guru and disciples are always connected from heart to heart.\n \n Dear Gurudev, this life is just for you. I wish to offer you my life, and I really pray that I can imbibe your mood and develop the qualities that you have.\n \n I always pray that all your disciples can have an ever-increasing relationship with you, and may we all follow in your footsteps. I always pray for your long and healthy life to serve Srila Prabhupada’s mission more and more. I am eternally grateful and indebted for everything that you have given me. I will never be able to repay you, Gurudev, but I pray that I can sincerely serve you throughout my life and beyond.\n Thank you, Gurudev, for everything. Please give me a chance to come back to Krishna along with you in this one lifetime.\n Your most insignificant servant,\n Anisha Semlani."

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Dearest Guru Maharaj,\n Every year, I try to assimilate my thoughts in expressing my gratitude towards you. Still, I fail to justify it as I don’t know where to start to count my blessings, but I want to take this opportunity on the occasion of your Vyasa Puja to remind myself of my good fortune and not to take this mercy for granted.\n \n This year has been one of the most challenging years for me personally, and sometimes, I am still in disbelief at how I am managing this situation, but when I reflect on it, it\u0027s all because of what I have heard from your classes and read in your books over the years.\n You have mentioned in your book about the two dogs that reside within our hearts—the good dog and the bad dog. You speak about how everyone has a battle internally whenever we experience a challenging situation. I never understood the depth of this analogy until I experienced something in my life that required me to practically apply this principle. It\u0027s been a test for me to curtail tendencies of envy, anger, and arrogance. Although it\u0027s been difficult, your life, teachings, and words have encouraged me to try the practice of forgiveness, self-control, and humility.\n \n There are so many things one could speak about you and your glorious qualities, and I will fall short of glorifying many of your qualities, but I just want to share one instance: this year, I heard the Kartik yatra classes online as I didn\u0027t have the fortune to travel, and during the first day of the class, HH Sacinandana Maharaj said that we are all fortunate to have the best guide in the sacred land of Vrindavan, which is you. In the class, you went on to speak about how Srila Prabhupada carried the important message of Lord Caitanya, leaving Vrindavan, which was to reveal the glories of Vrindavan through chanting the holy name of the Lord and developing a sincere taste for hearing. This made me realize that you were also following this in the mood of a servant of servants, like you expect from your disciples, by connecting with many souls around the world—materially successful, philanthropists, business leaders, celebrities, and many more—inspiring them to chant the holy name of the Lord, to visit holy dham, and simultaneously you\u0027re organizing the biggest Kartik yatra in India! What more could you do to convey the important message of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\n You perfectly exemplify your talk and action, which inspires me to be attentive in hearing and trying to implement in my life.\n \n I haven\u0027t had the fortune of seeing you for almost 3 years now, and it feels like a great misfortune, but I\u0027ve had the good fortune of serving some of your disciples and pray that I continue to get such opportunities. Maharaj, everyone is going through a lot of challenging situations in their life, and I realized that I have felt comfortable in fleeting moments of happiness, but in sober moments, I realize how there is a constant need to take shelter, and having a spiritual father like you has been one of my biggest blessings in my life, and I try to ask myself, \"How would Maharaj react if I were to speak a certain way or take action in a certain manner?\" I have many times failed in performing in a way to please you, but I can say that I have started to be aware of it and am begging for your forgiveness, and I will keep trying to be better, so that someday I can be a better individual and serve in a way to please you and the guru parampara.\n Please bless me on this auspicious occasion of your Vyasa-puja and pray for your ever good health.\n Wishing you a very happy Vyasa Puja Gurudev—Radhanath Swami ki Jai!!\n Your humble servant,\n Anjaneya Tirtha Das"

When I heard about the struggles of your life in your audiobook \u0027Journey Home\u0027, I was at home, and devotees were calling me. The thought immediately came to my mind that when you had found the association of devotees after so many difficulties and struggles, I should not lose this golden opportunity that was coming to me so easily. Thank you so much for guiding me and giving me faith in bhakti.\n\nYour katha is like the current of life for me. If your katha were not there, perhaps the chariot of my devotion would have remained stuck in one place, like a chariot without wheels. No matter how many difficulties come into my life, your katha has that magic that makes me stand up again. Just as a traveler wandering in the desert feels satiated even by a single drop of water, your katha works in my life in the same way.\n\nThe way you focus on the essence of bhakti in your lectures, especially on the mood and attitude with which one should serve, is something I have never heard anywhere else.\n\nMaharaj, during the Kartik Yatra, I saw the magic you have, where all devotees are always enthusiastic to serve. No one serves grudgingly; everyone serves lovingly. Everyone is busy encouraging each other. It was very inspiring to see the values you have imparted to the devotees and the excellent culture that has been established through them.\n\nMaharaj, I have not had much personal interaction with you in my life, nor am I so fortunate. However, I feel a connection with you from many, many lifetimes. I know full well that I am a very fallen, lowly, and sinful soul, always engrossed in sinful activities. It is definitely only by your mercy that I am able to perform whatever little devotion I can.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I am in extreme need of your mercy; otherwise, I do not know when I might lose this opportunity as well. Please accept me as your duly initiated disciple.\n\nMy prayer at your lotus feet is that for the ocean of love that is in your heart for Krishna, Radha Rani, the Acharyas, and Srila Prabhupada, may even a single drop of it arise in my heart. May this heart, which has been a house of garbage for lifetimes, become purified, and may the Lord manifest fully within it. May I have respect and loving friendship for the devotees in my heart, and deep respect for the spiritual masters.\n\nI am currently at a phase in my life from where this life can turn me in any direction, and Maya devi is trying her best to trap me in her illusion. I humbly pray to you to please give me your blessings, accept my prayers, and protect me.\n\nMay I always remain grateful to you and never even have the thought of leaving your lotus feet. May I always remain under your protection, or under the protection of your senior devotees.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nAnmol Varshney"

I don\u0027t know, Maharaj, how to express my thanks and gratitude to you.\n \n I just want to thank you first for a few things, such as your lectures which are filled with the love of Godhead and are the lifelines of the devotees. Your personal example, Maharaj, is so amazing that it inspires thousands of senior, junior, and all types of Vaishnavas to be exemplary and inspire others to be exemplary. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for giving the right attitude of trnad api sunicena for taking shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna. Thanks, Maharaj, for your consistent efforts to serve and please the devotees in the form of Kartik Yatras, in the form of your lectures, in the form of your system to take care of devotees. Maharaj, your lectures are so powerful that they are raising the consciousness of the jiva from being a self-enjoyer to giving enjoyment to Krsna and other devotees. Your lectures are filled with love for Krsna. Please bless, Maharaj, that in this lifetime I am able to become a humble servant of the servant of the servant of Hari, guru, and Vaishnavas. Please bless, Maharaj, that I can serve and please so many Vaishnavas around me, as that is the way to please you, Maharaj, and pleasing you is the way to please Krishna.\n \n Your Insignificant Servant,\n Anmol Vaswani\n ISKCON VARANASI"

On this sacred day of your seventy-fifth appearance, my heart longs to glorify you — for your presence is a blessing that brings life, hope, and devotion to countless souls.\n \n Gurudev, you are the living expression of Srila Prabhupada’s compassion. Every word you speak, every gentle action you take, and every tear that falls from your eyes reflects your unwavering love for Srila Prabhupada and his movement. In your heart, Srila Prabhupada’s desires remain safe; through your life, his vision continues to flourish. Whenever I think of you, I feel that Srila Prabhupada must be smiling, for you carry his legacy with such sincerity, humility, and purity that even sacred places awaken under your touch.\n \n By your inspiration, forgotten heritage has risen again. In Vrindavan, I visited Radha Damodar Temple — where Srila Prabhupada prayed and prepared to fulfill his spiritual master’s desire — your devotion feels alive, like an unbroken continuation of his offering. Standing near Rupa Goswami’s samadhi, one can sense the very qualities you embody: humility, gentleness, and a deep longing to serve. At Sanatan Goswami’s samadhi, your sincerity shines like a quiet flame — reminding all who come near that devotion is measured not by quantity but by the simplicity of the heart. And at Narottam Das Thakur’s samadhi mandir, the loving way you share Krishna consciousness — through warmth, care, and genuine affection — feels like a living reflection of his own devotional mood.\n \n Your life carries sacredness wherever you walk. And in Kolkata, I witnessed something extraordinary. Bhaktivinoda Asan — once a neglected, dilapidated house — now stands beautifully restored, dignified, and spiritually vibrant. This is the place where Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur wrote, prayed, and nourished the seeds of Lord Chaitanya’s teachings for the modern age. To see it revived felt like witnessing history come alive. Only someone carrying Srila Prabhupada’s heart could restore such an important jewel of Gaudiya heritage with such care and devotion. In that moment, I felt deeply that Srila Prabhupada must be so pleased with you.\n \n Gurudev, your qualities are beyond explanation. Your humility softens even the hardest hearts. Your compassion heals those who feel forgotten. Your kindness gives hope to souls who have lost direction. Your forgiveness melts hurt. Your presence alone brings comfort. You guide not with force, but with love so deep that it inspires transformation from within.\n \n To glorify you is to glorify the very essence of devotion. Your life shows what it means to serve Srila Prabhupada with one’s entire being — mind, heart, breath, and soul. Because of you, sacred places are awakening, devotees are finding shelter, and Srila Prabhupada’s movement is becoming strong, vibrant, and lovingly nourished.\n \n On this holy day, I pray that even one drop of your qualities may someday touch my heart. Please bless me to become humble, gentle, sincere, and dedicated like you, and to serve Srila Prabhupada’s movement with affection and devotion.\n \n Gurudev, thank you for being there. Thank you for loving Srila Prabhupada so purely. Thank you for pouring compassion into the world and touching the hearts of so many with your tenderness. Thank you for all that you have given, all that you continue to give, and all that you will inspire for generations.\n With deep gratitude, affection, and surrender,\n I place this small offering at your lotus feet.\n \n Your eternally aspiring servant,\n Anwesha"

All glories to Gurudev!\n Actually, my first yatra with Maharaj was to Jagannath Puri, but at that time I did not get the fortune of seeing Maharaj closely. During my second yatra to Mayapur, I was blessed with Maharaj’s close darshan, and I felt immense joy.Now, during this yatra at Govardhan in Vrindavan, I truly received Maharaj’s mercy. I was fortunate to have Maharaj’s darshan from very close. Just two days before the yatra, I got the opportunity to join the Latur group of Matajis who were engaged in service. When we reached Govardhan, I got the chance to serve along with them. We did the service of cutting dry fruits together.I came to know that Maharaj was about to arrive there. Shortly after, Maharaj came. All of us Matajis went outside to welcome him. Maharaj stepped out of the car, folded his hands, and looked at everyone as he walked forward. At that moment, my daughter and I folded our hands and offered full obeisances. I felt as if Maharaj was showering his mercy upon me and my daughter through his glance. That moment was unforgettable for me.\n \n Maharaj’s quality of humility is truly extraordinary. During the seven-day yatra at Govardhan, I got the opportunity to hear Maharaj narrate the Govardhan pastimes. And Maharaj’s kirtans were even more wonderful! Every day the tune of the sankirtan was different, and I loved them all. When Maharaj would chant “Jaya Jaya Sri Radhe,” it felt as if we had truly reached the lotus feet of Srimati Radharani—as if Maharaj had taken us to Goloka Dham.\n \n Finally, I pray at the lotus feet of the Lord that Maharaj be blessed with strong health and that I may have the fortune of Maharaj’s association every year. I also pray at the lotus feet of Gurudev that I may progress in my spiritual service.\n Hare Krishna, my humble obeisances."

        "Your Offering ":  "07 December 2025\n\nDear Gurudev\n\nPlease accept our most humble obeisances at your most precious lotus feet.\n\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nWish you a very happy and most auspicious 75th appearance day!\n\nWith a most grateful heart, we remember you very fondly on this special day. Thank you so much for appearing in our insignificant lives and accepting us as your servants despite being absolutely unqualified to receive your mercy.\n\nWe wish you good health and sincerely pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji for your well-being always. May Their unlimited and most precious blessings eternally flow through you to touch many, many more souls and inspire them to devote their lives to the mission of Lord Gauranga.\n\nGurudev, your life’s journey has been most inspiring and unparalleled. Your unflinching faith, unshakable determination, unlimited sacrifices, unbelievable austerities, boundless compassion, and above all, complete surrender to the Lord while seeking the essence are most amazing. You have always made yourself accessible to one and all without any discrimination, often while sacrificing your own health and comforts. Your energy and enthusiasm to preach and to give yourself completely to the mission of Srila Prabhupada is exemplary. Your loving dealings not only with your godbrothers and godsisters, senior devotees in the movement, neophytes, but also with every other living entity that comes in contact with your Holiness are most inspiring. You inspire everyone around you by personally living the teachings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, especially epitomizing the verse that you often quote as the very fabric of devotional service: \u0027trnad api sunicena taror iva sahishnuna, amanina manadena kirtaniya sada harih\u0027.\n\nGurudev, you have so lovingly and graciously given us your mercy through your nectarian instructions, through the wonderful community of devotees, and through your most invaluable, yet most rare, personal association. We are grateful to the community of devotees that helps to keep us anchored, preventing us from going astray. But we earnestly and patiently wait for an opportunity to have your personal association to humbly serve you personally in order to recharge our spiritual journey.\n\nGurudev, despite the most precious opportunity that you have given to uplift our consciousness, we continue to falter and struggle with material sense enjoyment at every step of life. Our intense conditioning is always clouding our existence and pulling us back away from the real purpose of life. Our stubborn mind repeatedly ignores this precious opportunity and forces us to succumb to its desires. Please accept our most sincere apologies for any offenses committed knowingly or unknowingly at your lotus feet.\n\nGurudev, by your special mercy and the blessings of many devotees, including my elder brother, Gauranga Sundar Prabhu, I have been allowed to be of some insignificant service at the annual Barsana Eye Camp over the past many years. The opportunity to serve the Brajvasis in various capacities in the outpatient and inpatient wards, as well as in cataract operations, is most invaluable for an insignificant and unqualified soul like me. I am eternally grateful and sincerely pray that your mercy allows me to humbly serve them to the best of my abilities under the guidance of senior devotees in the future as well. May I always be reminded of your instruction that this special service is actually the most invaluable opportunity to clear my own cloudy, conditioned, and polluted material consciousness.\n\nGurudev, here in Singapore, we are blessed to have a very special congregation of devotees which include disciples of many exalted spiritual masters in Srila Prabhupada’s movement, as well as many of our own godbrothers and godsisters lovingly and co-operatively serving Sri Jagannath, Baladev, Subhadra Mai at the Gauranga centre under the guidance of HG Devakinandan Prabhuji. We are also so fortunate to have darshan of and an opportunity to hear from many spiritual masters and senior devotees who happen to travel through Singapore. Yet, we earnestly yearn for an opportunity to welcome you to Singapore once again and have your divine darshan, as well as hear from you again in person.\n\nWe once again wish you a very auspicious and glorious 75th appearance day.\n\nWith sincere gratitude, bowing down at your lotus feet,\n\nYour most insignificant and unqualified servants,\nAravind Govind Das, Achyuta Radhika Devi Dasi, Gopal and Govind\nSingapore"

Your words are so deep, meaningful and full of content that it fills the vacuum of my heart. Though because of my insincerity I have not given quality time to hear exclusively but I am hearing while taking bath or while doing my daily chores. I pray that I become sincere to give exclusive time to hear your Vani.\n This year Kartik Yatra was very nourishing. You gave us wonderful parikrama of Govardhan through the medium of sound vibration with so many esoteric pastimes that I had never heard. Every day evening Katha was so nourishing that I made it a point to hear them again.\n Through your wonderful lectures as well as your intense prayerful kirtans I felt you are training us to come to higher levels of Krishna consciousness where the intensity and the consciousness is very high.\n I felt through this whole Kartik Yatra you are training us to become residents of the spiritual world where there are innumerable devotees together joyfully serving Sri Sri Radha Krishna. There was a similar mood in the yatra and you have created that mood. In this Kartik Yatra, like every year, you appreciated everyone – the cooks, labourers, the chapati-making matajis, devotees who made annakut offerings, devotees who did various other services, and at the end, all yatra participants.\n I regularly relish the service of proofreading the Bengali *Journey Home* book that I had received 10 years back. I have started again reading *The Journey Home* to absorb the wonderful realizations and experiences that you have shared.\n I am an unworthy disciple of yours, struggling with my mind and senses. Thus I pray for strength to continue with determination in my spiritual life.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Aravinda Gopal Das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurudev, Please accept my humble obeisances.\n All Glories to Srila Prabhupada !!\n \n Recently, during the auspicious Kārtika month, I had the great fortune to hear your transcendental lecture series on the childhood pastimes of Bāla Gopāla in Gokula and Vṛndāvana.\n You beautifully described how the gopīs became fully immersed when Śrī Kṛṣṇa played His enchanting flute, forgetting everything—home, family, and worldly duties—drawn only by His divine call.\n You spoke of Yaśodā-māī, lovingly churning butter while singing the glories of her beloved Kṛṣṇa, her mind and heart completely absorbed in Him. You reminded us how the entire land of Gokula and Vṛndāvana lived in full immersion—every action, every breath centered around Kṛṣṇa.\n You also narrated how Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, while conversing with Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, became deeply immersed in the transcendental pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. In those moments of divine ecstasy, Mahāprabhu revealed the profound moods of separation and love that reside in the heart of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Hearing this, our hearts were carried to the banks of the Godāvarī, where Mahāprabhu tasted the nectar of Kṛṣṇa’s līlā.\n You also shared how our great ācāryas were immersed in the Lord’s pastimes:\n Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who immersed his entire being in chanting the holy name with unwavering love and faith.\n Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, so deeply absorbed in remembrance of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, that he once did not even recognize Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī Herself when She personally appeared before him.\n And Śrīla Prabhupāda, who immersed himself in the order of his spiritual master, crossing oceans with complete faith to carry forward the mission of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to every corner of the world.\n Gurudeva, you immerse yourself fully in the līlā of the Lord, and through your devotional narration, you draw our hearts into that same sacred space. Your gentle voice, combined with special sound effects, makes the experience so vivid that it feels as if the Lord’s pastimes are unfolding right before us.\n \n Following in the footsteps of our Guru-paramparā, you bring all of us—your disciples and followers—into that same spiritual current of bhakti, allowing us to taste a drop of the sweet nectar of the Lord’s līlā.\n \n On this most auspicious day of your 75th Vyāsa-pūjā, I bow down at your lotus feet and offer my heartfelt prayer:\n “May I receive even a tiny drop of the deep immersion you carry in your heart for the pastimes of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. If by your mercy I can taste even a small portion of that bhakti-rasa, my life will be truly successful.”\n \n Gurudeva, thank you for allowing us to experience the sweetness of the Lord’s pastimes through your pure heart and words.\n \n Please bless me so that I may always remain immersed in devotional service, connected to your lotus feet, and anchored in the eternal shelter of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and their pure devotees.\n \n I pray to aspire to be a servant of your servant,\n \n Arjuna Prana Dasa."

Only a true disciple can be a great spiritual master or guru. Maharaj’s life from childhood has been that of a genuine seeker of absolute truth , understanding deeply various paths of religion and spirituality . This deep desire to perfect his life made him cross borders of countries , meet many great spiritual leaders , face various dangerous and life threatening incidents and finally led him to the lotus feet to Srila Prabhupad in 1971 at cross maidan Mumbai. That Srila Prabhupad recognised his presence from a sea of thousands of assembled people is just amazing and divine. \n\nHis attraction to lord Sri krishna right from the time he saw his painting as a teenager in America to reaching Mathura by getting pushed out of a crowded Indian railway train is more than a normal coincidence. It was Lord Krishna’s desire that his dear servant returns back to the eternal abode of Vraj. \n\nOver last five and a half  decades  maharaj has attracted  the hearts of so many millions of souls from multitude of sections of society across the globe through his divine Bhagavatam and chaitanya charitamrita lectures , his soul touching kirtans , soul awakening corporate talks , divine Vaishnav qualities and his own example as a perfect Vaishnava in all facets of life. \n\nHis presence in this world is a gift to mankind, a great example of a perfect disciple , a perfect servant leader and divine Vaishnav guru , a loving god brother and in short , a perfect well wisher and friend to all. \n\nOn his 75th Vyasa puja , we offer our humble prayers at his lotus feet that we remain a part of this great spiritual organisation of ISKCON and try our best to serve His Holiness and his exalted disciples in their mission to attract everyone to Sri Radha Krishna  and lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. \n\nHare Krishna !

The mission of spreading Sri Chaitanya Mahāprabhu’s saṅkīrtana movement all over the world, which Srila Prabhupada began, is being carried forward by you, Maharaj—his qualified son endowed with all the qualities of a pure Vaiṣṇava. Today, millions of people across various parts of the world are becoming enlightened by seeing you and receiving your teachings, and thus are embracing Krishna consciousness.\n \n Maharaj, you yourself are the living example of how a devotee should behave—not only toward Vaiṣṇavas but toward all living entities from the entire human race down to every creature.\n \n Your book *The Journey Home* can inspire any person in the world to overcome any situation in life. From your life’s journey, we can easily understand how one must keep unshakeable faith in the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, even while going through the most challenging circumstances.\n \n I am an insignificant, tiny soul. At a time in my life when I had completely lost direction, your quotation—\n  *“Do not take this material world so seriously, because it is always changing. Something terrible that you take so seriously today is going to change tomorrow.”*\n —completely transformed my entire mindset.\n \n It was after receiving your teachings and mercy that I joined ISKCON in 2018. From that very day, I accepted you within my heart as my Guru Maharaj, although I still feel that I have not yet developed the qualification to become the disciple of such a great, pure Vaiṣṇava like you.\n \n The example of rendering wholehearted service to one’s spiritual master—and doing so very carefully for the fulfillment of his divine mission—is something we can easily understand from your deep affection and dedication to Srila Prabhupada, Srila Guru Maharaj.\n \n I could not have the fortune of seeing Sri Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, but when I saw you dancing ecstatically in the Jagannath Ratha Yatra, my heart felt that desire fulfilled.\n \n You are an ocean of unlimited divine qualities, Srila Guru Maharaj. I am extremely insignificant… The glories of your qualities and teachings can never be completely described. Through your teachings, you have become an ideal example for the entire human society all over the world.\n \n In this vast ocean of material existence, drowning helplessly in Krishna’s illusory energy, I am an extremely insignificant soul. By your mercy, Maharaj, I have received the fortune of discovering a great and exalted personality like Srila Prabhupada. By your mercy, I have become able to understand the meaning of the scriptures that Srila Prabhupada has given us.\n \n My only prayer to the Supreme Lord Krishna and to Srila Prabhupada is this: even if not in this lifetime, then in some lifetime, may I receive even a drop of your causeless mercy, Maharaj.\n \n An insignificant beggar of your causeless mercy,\n Arnab Dewan"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna dear Guru Maharaj, Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet. All glories to you. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nLove is the last word in transcendence. To love means to serve, and to serve means to please. Genuine love is a desire to please without any selfish motivations. The true object of love is Krishna, and Sri Radha is the abode of all love. Being the eternal servants of Sri Sri Radha Govinda, we have the innate need to love and to be loved. Prema pumartho mahan — the highest goal of life is to revive our dormant love for God. Beyond philosophical conviction or scriptural understanding, it is love that invokes the surrender of the heart. One who experiences even a glimpse of a drop of true love for God is overwhelmed with unlimited gratitude and develops a desire to surrender his whole existence for that love.\nDear Guru Maharaj, it is by your mercy and teachings that I finally realized what I was always seeking — genuine love. I’m sincerely grateful, for you have brought me closer to this divine treasure of love for God. You surrendered yourself to the unconditional love of your spiritual master, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. Submerged in an ocean of gratitude for his unconditional love, you have spent every moment of your life in service to his mission unconditionally. Whenever you speak about Srila Prabhupada, your heart erupts with love and gratitude for Srila Prabhupada. You have bestowed your unconditional love upon us, although we are undeserving in every way. You’re doing so much to shower your love upon us. Kartik yatra is a deep illustration of this unconditional love. Your words calmed the storms of doubts and questions raging in our hearts. I heard an incident from HG Vraj Bihari Pr. A boy from the slums of Mumbai, who was very uncivilized, harsh, and ill-mannered due to his unfortunate past and conditions, was transformed in heart by your loving embrace and developed a genuine trace of love for you in his heart. In the same manner, I was an egoistic, narrow-minded, and self-righteous person with no understanding of the purpose of life. But your love has transformed my hard heart, and I have developed a tinge of desire to love you, through which I can love Sri Sri Radha KrishnaChandra someday. I’m eternally indebted for your unconditional love. I wish and pray to forever remain in the shelter of your love, in the shelter of your divine grace.\nLove is very personal. In your offering to Srila Prabhupada on his disappearance day, you said, “If one surrenders to the vani, one gets the association of vapu in the heart — a very deep, personal association.” Without your personal association, there is no hope for my spiritual life. Please bless me so that I approach your vani with the right attitude and personally worship your lotus feet in my heart always. Only a heart fertile with gratitude can recognize and appreciate love. I sincerely wish to cultivate this quality of gratitude so that I can receive your love and strive to reciprocate. I know that the only way we can reciprocate your mercy upon us is to live your teachings — to serve the mission of Srila Prabhupada in the mood of servant of the servant and sincerely take shelter of the holy names. I must admit my weak faith, insincere attitude, and ungrateful heart. On this most auspicious day of your Vyasa-puja, I commit myself to sincerely practice this most glorious path of devotional service to Sri Sri Radha Govinda. Please bless me so that I can execute this desire of mine. Please bless me so that I can serve with unconditional love, without any reservations or malice in the heart. Please bless me so that I can sincerely serve as an instrument of your dear servants, who have brought me to your shelter.\nDear Guru Maharaj, I’m praying for your good health every day. I cannot imagine what would’ve happened to me without your gracious presence in my life. I always yearn to serve under you. I always long to be in your divine association.\nIn deep separation from your lotus feet,\nYour eternal servant,"

Because Girirāj provides Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma, Their cows, calves, and cowherd friends with everything they need—cooling water, soft nourishing grass, protective caves, and a variety of fruits, flowers, and vegetables.\n\nIn a similar and deeply meaningful way, you, Gurudeva, are among the finest servants of Śrīla Prabhupāda. Like Girirāj Govardhan:\n\nYou offer water-like nectarean lectures that quench the intense thirst of my heart for Kṛṣṇa-kathā - your voice overflowing with love, devotion, and a child-like enthusiasm that awakens life in my spiritual journey.\n\nYou offer caves of shelter in the form of your empowered disciples, whose guidance and care perfectly reflect your mood of compassion and devotee care—just as Govardhan’s caves provide relief and protection.\n\nYour humility is like the soft grass of Govardhan, embodying the instruction of Mahāprabhu—tṛṇād api sunīcena. Witnessing your interactions with your godbrothers nourishes us with the sweetness of genuine Vaiṣṇava humility.\n\nYour presence is fragrant like Govardhan’s flowers, naturally attracting the hearts of devotees and non-devotees alike. Whoever comes near you inevitably receives divine nourishment—just as bees receive nectar simply by coming close to blossoming flowers.\n\nYour teachings are the fruits and vegetables of Govardhan, full of essential spiritual vitamins—gratitude, forgiveness, love, cooperation, humility—which strengthen our immunity against the relentless influence of Māyā.\n\n\nOh dear Gurudeva, you are truly an ocean of mercy. Though my heart struggles with deep-rooted anarthas, the remembrance of you each day is like a potent antidote that gives me strength to fight. Sometimes I succeed, and sometimes I fail—but your presence gives me hope to continue.\n\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyāsa-pūjā, I fall at your lotus feet and beg for your mercy. Please bless me with sincerity, steadfastness, and unshakable spiritual strength, so that I may serve you far beyond my present capacity.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nAshraya Gopal Dās"

We are so grateful to you for giving us this opportunity to glorify our beloved Gurudev for his pleasure, and at the same time, to reflect on your teachings, to learn from them, and to become a good servant.\n \n With your mercy and the mercy of Srila Prabhupada, I have completed five years in the association of Prabhupada’s ISKCON family. For a distracted and insincere soul like me, this could only be possible because of the constant support, guidance, and gentle taming from your wonderful disciples and aspiring disciples. I am forever indebted to them.\n \n By the end of this November, Gurudev, I will also be completing three years of chanting 16 rounds. In these three years, I must have missed the daily minimum for approximately four to five days, but I covered them the next days. Still, I must be honest with you, Gurudev — the quality of my chanting is very poor. Most of the time, it is multitasking and mechanical.\n But today, through this offering, I promise to improve my chanting, and in the next Vyasa-puja offering, I will surely submit a positive report.\n \n Regarding hearing and reading Srila Prabhupada’s books, I have been inconsistent — sometimes due to lack of time, but mostly due to excuses. I sincerely look forward to improving in this area as well.\n \n From the lectures of Srila Prabhupada, your Godbrothers, yourself, and your disciples, I have learned that the holy name of Krishna is greater than Krishna Himself, because when Krishna is upset with us, His holy name can save us. But even greater than the holy name is the mercy of one’s Guru, because if even the holy name is displeased with us, only the Guru can save us. Guru is the representative and the most beloved of Krishna.\n And if Guru is upset, then the jīva is truly hopeless.\n \n Guru Maharaj, all my actions are upsetting. I have not been doing well in either material or spiritual life. I am insincere, inconsistent, and careless — but my only hope is you. Please, Gurudev, do not be upset with me. I promise to become a good servant and, someday, a humble and sincere devotee.\n Please save me, Gurudev.\n \n Gurudev, through your actions you exemplify how a devotee — and even more, how a disciple — should act. As you are my only hope, I have written a small song for you. I initially planned to offer it personally at your lotus feet, but please accept it through this medium. I pray to Krishna to grant me even one opportunity to sing it personally before you someday. 🎶\n \n Drowning in the ocean of nescience,\n Had no hope, then you came in my life,\n Darkness was pervading in my mind,\n You burnt yourself to give me all light.\n \n From the street of West to Himalayan feet,\n You came out of mercy to deliver me,\n Lost in material world, I was lurking around,\n Didn’t find no peace, I was looking all wrong.\n \n Oh Gurudev… Oh Gurudev… ami tomar kukur! Gurudev\n Oh Gurudev… Oh Gurudev… ami tomar kukur! Gurudev\n \n Working round the clock for Prabhupada’s pleasure,\n Humility so high, and no time for leisure,\n Embodiment of love and Srila Prabhupada’s mercy,\n Building GEV and divine communities.\n \n “krishna se tomara, krishna dite paro,\n tomara sakati ache\n ami to’ kangala, ‘krishna’ ‘krishna’ boli’,\n dhai tava pache pache.”\n \n Ohh Gurudev… Ohh Gurudev… ami tomar kukur! Gurudev\n Ohh Gurudev… Ohh Gurudev… ami tomar kukur! Gurudev\n \n I hope you liked it, Gurudev. The song is composed, but it is not possible to share the audio through this medium.\n \n Thank you, Gurudev, for everything you have given us, and for all that we are yet to realise. We are eternally indebted for your causeless mercy. I will surely work upon everything I have promised, Gurudev.\n \n Thank you so much, Gurudev.\n Hare Krishna.\n \n Please accept my humble obeisances.\n Your most insignificant aspiring servant,\n Astitva"

It is your causeless mercy that you have given shelter at your lotus feet to this rascal. Although I am an unworthy and useless disciple, still your ahaituki kripa is inconceivable and unlimited. It is impossible for even Lord Ananta to describe your glories with His unlimited hoods and mouths, so what to speak of this one tiny, insignificant fool disciple?

During this Govardhan yatra, you gave me something so special and inconceivable that I cannot even dream of it. I am afraid to share it here, but you allowed me to do that service.

And honestly, Gurumaharaj, I am stuck in the illusion that I will find happiness in it, and now I am always looking for name, fame, and prestige. Please, Gurumaharaj, please help me to come out from it.\n\nGurumaharaj, I have increased my vow of daily hearing your lecture to 50 minutes and daily reading Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books to 50 minutes. I do not know, Gurumaharaj, how to truly read Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books and take shelter of your lectures. Please help me so that I can honestly and genuinely hear your lectures and fully follow your instructions without any deviation. Gurumaharaj, I want to be always loyal to you, and whatever things may come, I always try to seek only through your vaani. Please bless and allow me. Gurumaharaj, I want to come back to Godhead, but unless I please and serve your instructions, this thought of going back doesn\u0027t really attract me. The only desire that comes is to go and humbly and menially serve your instructions and serve Srila Prabhupada\u0027s disciples and their disciples and make it my life and soul.\n\nGurumaharaj, you have given me some special devotees in my life.

Later, you went to university to preach throughout the West. The reason for recalling all this is that we sometimes think that we are doing so much and battling on the ground, and using basic facilities. Pure devotees like you, Maharaj, have done so much for the mission, but we can\u0027t even understand with our contaminated minds. We are ready to see faults so easily and put ourselves in a better position.\nOh dear Vaishnava thakur, grant me some mercy that I can remain faithful and serve wholeheartedly in this great mission.

Honestly, Guru Maharaj, now I fear that if I commit sinful activities or any mundane activity, others may blame my Guru for accepting me as a disciple. Although my propensity for committing offenses has not gone away, still I have solace that if I simply hold your lotus feet, just like a raw fruit ripens simply by holding onto its tree, then I will become a nice servant. Maharaj, day by day when I hear your pastimes at ISKCON Juhu, my heart is lost in your humility standards. Your teachings to serve hot, nice food to all devotees, your unique mosquito net invention at Juhu temple, your first-class toilet construction for devotees at Juhu temple, your dedication to serving Kirtan for the Lord when all alone with a harmonium, your spiritually caring words to devotees even at their deathbed, YOUR MINUTE CARE WHILE PUTTING GARLANDS TO SRILA PRABHUPADA, your love, spiritual care for devotees\u0027 kids, your guest-serving attitude at Juhu temple, your manifestation of GEV, which is my dream place to serve forever, your genuineness, honesty, simplicity, humble nature, your utmost care for each and every animal you come across, your compassionate nature by which you accept a sinful lady like me, your transcendental smile which takes most of my pain away, your love for Vrindavan, your love for Krishna as you accepted at Kumbh Mela – all these natures are jewels. All of us can be successful in life if we can even follow a little portion of your nature. Your genuineness, respect for all devotees, especially your godbrothers and godsisters, whatever I have heard from your disciples, it attracts me more towards your lotus feet. Please bless me, Maharaj, to be a genuine servant of Your loved ones. Please forgive all my shortcomings, Maharaj. Lust, greed, etc., are troubling me a lot.

These Amrutha droplets uplift all of us, as it nourishes the spiritual relationships, and we are always indebted to you.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, your mantra of pleasing devotees is – pleasing Krishna by serving them. This is very inspiring for a fallen soul like me. You show us the path that the spirit of desire is, a humble servant of the servant of the servant.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, you always stress imbibing the quality of the spirit of submissiveness, simplicity, and dedication to serve. You also stress that we can engage in Krishna’s service properly.\n Such services Krishna accepts.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, because of your mercy and blessings, and the motivation of Siksha gurus and senior devotees, I could attend the Karthik Mela Mahotsav 2025 at the foothills of Giriraj Govardhan under your auspices.\n \n I want to express my deep feeling of gratitude towards Karthik Mela Mahotsav, where the devotees of the whole world gathered for the divine experience.\n My heart knew no bounds when I saw your divine presence in front of my eyes. The whole year we wait for this moment to get your merciful glance. I cannot stop myself from thanking Lord Krishna and Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, during the congregation at the foothills of Govardhan, words delivered from your Srimukha took all of us into the divine world of Dwapar Yuga, where the Lord performed His pastimes along with Lord Balarama, Gopas, and Gopis.\n \n Your divine presence on Vyasa asana, surrounded by 12,000 devotees, gave us the feeling of all the Rishis of Naimisaranya as they came to hear Bhagavatam from Suta Maha Muni.\n \n During the sankirtan time, everyone present could feel and realize the purification of their souls. And Harinama Ganamrutha from your srimukha was enthralling and reflecting the Chaitanya Maha Prabhu’s Sankirtan movement.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, under your guidance, the Mega Kitchen led by HG Gauranga Prabhu and senior devotees for serving more than 12,000 devotees for 7 days was amazing.\n The exemplary Samarpan Bhava and commitment displayed by all the devotees was unforgettable – only because of your grace and blessings.\n \n In my personal experience, I was elated to prepare bhoga for Sri Giri Raj Govardhan as a part of annakuta by using the ancient method of cooking in earthen pots and on iron stoves. And your divine presence amongst us and your merciful glance on me made me feel more responsible towards rendering services. I am very grateful to you, Guru Maharaj, for this causeless mercy.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, after the yearly Karthik yatra celebrations, our celebrations keep continuing while waiting for your Vyasa Puja Mahotsav. These celebrations help us to maintain the same spiritual enthusiasm throughout the year.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, your 3 tips for good mental health, which help in our daily sadhana, are:\n 1. Keep good company.\n 2. Make positive daily choices.\n 3. Have a spiritual practice.\n \n I am very blessed to be in Kanaiya Des Kuwait amongst the Siksha gurus, which makes these 3 aspects easily practicable.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, your teachings to smile in adverse conditions do give us the moral boost not only in our spiritual progress but also in dealing with mundane situations.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, as you always say, our chanting will not uplift our consciousness unless we have cooperative, affectionate relationships with each other, and this is evident in Kanaiya Des.\n We are always grateful to you, Srila Prabhupada, and ISKCON’s Guru Parampara.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, I am very grateful that you have accepted this unworthy fallen soul and given shelter at your lotus feet as your humble servant.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, I beg for your mercy and blessings to progress in Krishna consciousness and remove all my anarthas that have been accumulated over the years and over the lifetimes. I totally surrender unto your lotus feet and beg for your mercy and direction. You are my Spiritual Guru, My father, My everything.\n \n Your insignificant sevika,\n A. Sasikiran Venkateshwar"

Your classes not only remind us of our constitutional position as eternal servants of Krishna, correct philosophical deviations in our intelligence, and remove unlimited unwanted samskaras from our polluted minds. Simply being in your presence is a blessing, and we are able to experience “jahara nikata gelo, pape dure jaye.” Thank you so much for having such a transcendental healing effect on our lives.\n Dear Gurudeva, you have given us the most precious Deities of our lives. We were introduced to Krishna Consciousness in the programs at Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, where we also met you for the first time. Then in Pune, we had the blessing of living under the shelter of Sri Sri Radha Vrindavanchandra. You have also blessed us with service to Sri Sri Radha Brajasundar. Now that we are living far from a temple, these Deities are providing an immense shower of blessings for us and so many devotees who are taking Their regular darshan and services through our regular house program.\n Maharaj, what can we speak about how you have nourished us with prasadam throughout our lives. We experience your love for us in the nectar of the prasadam we have during yatras. We are trying our level best to cultivate these qualities for serving prasadam at our home.\n Dear Gurudeva, we get new light about the loving dealings of Their Lordships and Their devotees in every class you give, and we learn so much about pure devotional service from them.\n Recently, we relocated from Pune to Bangalore for work. Initially, we were very apprehensive about our devotional service here — how will we get association, engagements, temple programs, festivals? But by your, Srila Prabhupada’s, and Krishna’s grace, we got association of the most enthusiastic and sincere devotees we could imagine. The devotees here are so welcoming and encouraging that we have felt completely at home. We have been engaged in services and learning so many devotional aspects by the mercy of devotees here. Also, some families here are trying to meet every week to discuss Krishna katha at our place. Thank you, dear Gurudev, for your unwavering support through your disciples, lectures, and kirtans.\n Eternally grateful to you, dear Gurudev, for giving us such enriching experiences through your divine association in the form of your nectarean lectures, kirtans, the devotees you have cultivated, projects like GEV, and yatras.\n Praying at your lotus feet to bless us so that we are able to follow your instructions sincerely and faithfully till our last breath. Your absorption and intensity in devotional service inspire us the most.\n And also your genuine care and personal concern for each and every devotee is so heart-touching. We aspire to have just a small fraction of these qualities.\n You put your heart and soul into every action of yours. Kindly bless us so that we may realize someday how much effort you are putting for all of us to progress in our devotional service.\n We feel very blessed to receive your mercy through your wonderful disciples.\n Maharaj, just as you are so committed to the service of Srila Prabhupada, we pray that we may have a fraction of your dedication and become instruments of your love and compassion in this world.\n We are begging for your mercy to have unmotivated and uninterrupted intentions to please Guru and Krishna.\n Maharaj, we pray that our children take wholeheartedly to the process of Krishna Consciousness and blossom in devotional service.\n Kindly empower us so that we may always remain as your insignificant servants in sharing this blissful Krishna Consciousness with others.\n \n Your insignificant servants,\n Avatari Chaitanya das,\n Prem Preeti devi dasi,\n Hrishikesh and Jahnavi"

I do not know how to properly write an offering, and although there are countless lessons I have received from you, I am not able to recall all of them while writing this. In truth, the teachings that come from you are infinite, ever-fresh, and beyond what my limited mind can hold.\n \n Yet there are a few precious instructions that have transformed my vision of life. You have taught me to love every living being, because each is an eternal soul, part and parcel of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. You have taught me that different behaviours in people often arise from their past circumstances, and therefore we should respond with compassion, not judgment. You constantly emphasize the mood of tṛṇād api sunīcena – to become humbler than a blade of grass.\n \n From you I have learned gratitude, simplicity, true humility, and being childlike. I have learned what real love is, and what a genuine service attitude truly means. You notice even the smallest details that everyone else overlooks, and you show how everything, even the tiniest thing, can be perfectly engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa.\n \n I am very small and insignificant, yet I am begging for your blessings so that I may serve this divine mission with the right mood, the right intentions, and in the right way, overcoming all obstacles on the path. May my only aim be to serve, without any separate desire, the mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda and the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, exactly as you wish.\n \n Nothing is hidden from you, Mahārāj.

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurumaharaj,\n Please accept my respectful obeisances at your lotus feet.\n All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n By a great stroke of mercy, earlier this year I sat before you at ISKCON of Silicon Valley, surrendering my life. Devotees told me that accepting you as my spiritual master might mean little, if any, personal association. Though this made me nervous, I knew I had to accept it and learn to serve as your disciple regardless.\n You are actually present before me at all times, giving me strength and inspiration to carry on. As Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura sings, *ekaki āmāra nāhi pāya bala harināma-saṅkīrtana* — on our own, we have no strength in devotional service and cannot propagate the glories of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. But simply by serving His bona fide representative, in the mood of the servant of the servant, we receive the most precious drop of faith.\n Your disciples are your limbs, and everything we do is actually done by you alone. By your divine instructions and flawless example, you nurture the creeper of faith within our hearts and allow us the privilege of serving Kṛṣṇa through harināma-saṅkīrtana.\n The spiritual father or guru is dear because of his relationship with Kṛṣṇa — the ultimate reality. Uddhava glorifies the Lord, explaining that Kṛṣṇa appears externally as the ācārya in order to lead the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead. As Kṛṣṇa’s pure representative, you are our lifeline on the path of pure devotional service. Just as Kṛṣṇa can simultaneously reciprocate with each of His devotees, you also reciprocate with your disciples. Through your lectures, you mirror His words, qualities, and desires — so that a conditioned soul like myself may find inspiration and guidance.\n The life of Śrīla Prabhupāda is a tangible example of what it means to give oneself fully in Kṛṣṇa’s service, and you have followed in the wake of his lotus footsteps, devoting your entire life — from youth to old age — to inspiring and encouraging others to surrender to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s lotus feet.\n I do not feel qualified to be the servant of such a glorious master as yourself, but as the Lord tells Prahlāda Mahārāja:\n “Those who follow your example will naturally become My pure devotees. You are the best example of My devotee, and others should follow in your footsteps.”\n Therefore, I feel justified in making the bold request that you please allow me to do as you have done — to give up all material desires, all petty weaknesses of heart, and all lingering ambitions for name and fame, and instead develop the spiritual desire to uplift others and devote my entire life in your service.\n As Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura prays, *śakti-buddhi-hīna āmi ati dīna, koro’ more ātma-sātha* — although I am devoid of all strength and intelligence, I beg you to please make me your beloved servant.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Balarām Gopāla Dāsa"

In the Padma Purana, Lord Siva tells Parvati “Of all types of worship, worship of Lord Vishnu is the best, and better than worship of Lord Vishnu is the worship of His devotee, the Vaishnava.\n \n One who performs worship of Lord Govinda but fails to worship His devotee should be understood to be not a devotee of the Lord but simply a victim of false pride”.\n \n So, we are doubly bound, by an injunction as well as a prohibition to celebrate this Most Blessed event, Sri Vyasa Puja. To further demonstrate by His own example, Lord Caitanya Himself instituted this auspicious celebration – Sri Vyasa Puja as chronicled in the Caitanya Bhagavata, Madhya Khanda Chapter 5. That inaugural Vyasa Puja happened in the year 1509 in Srivasa Aangan. “Srivasa Pandit, the head priest of the function, gave Lord Nityananda a flower garland to offer to a painting of Vyasadeva. Holding the garland in His beautiful lotus hand, Nityananda Prabhu hesitated and began glancing here and there as if he was looking for someone. Then to everyone’s surprise Nityananda offered the garland to Sri Caitanyadeva instead...”. Lord Gauranga is the guru of Sri Nityananda Prabhu. This is the basis of the worship performed by Lord Nityananda. Therefore, the worship of Vyasa-deva, is factually the worship of Lord Gauranga in the form of the present acarya.\n \n Expression churns and reinforces emotions. The celebration of Sri Vyasa Puja - The Most Blessed Event is an expression of the gratitude that a disciple feels for the spiritual master. And that gratitude is reaffirmed when a disciple expresses one’s own gratitude and hears other disciples’ express their gratitude. During the course of our devotional life, Sri Vyasa Puja affords us an annual opportunity to set aside our mind’s wanderings on the trivialities that occupy our consciousness and single-pointedly bring our attention to the matchless gift, the causeless mercy that our spiritual master has brought into our lives and into the lives of those he has touched.\n \n It is a special day to deeply contemplate how the spiritual master is acting personally in the lives of so many and how we/they are receiving his innumerable gifts and how we/they are acting in that prime relationship. It is a day to focus on his glories and not get caught up in our own insecurities, our inadequacies, failings.\n \n Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakura perfectly captures our condition and the indispensable and merciful role our spiritual master plays in our life. In one of his Saranagati Songs, Emona durmati, he writes “Oh Lord! Such a wicked mind has brought me into this world, but one of Your pure and elevated devotees has come to bring me out of it. He saw me so fallen and wretched, took pity, and came to me saying, O humbled soul, please listen to this good tiding, for it will gladden your heart.\n \n Sri Krsna Caitanya has appeared in the land of Navadvipa to deliver you. He has safely conducted many miserable souls such as you across the sea of worldly existence. To fulfill the promise of the Vedas, the son of a brahmana bearing the name Mahaprabhu of golden complexion, has descended with His brother the avadhuta Nityananda. Together They have overwhelmed all of Nadia with divine ecstasy. Sri Caitanya, who is Krishna Himself, the son of Nanda, has saved the world by freely distributing His own holy name. Go also and receive your deliverance.”\n \n We cannot go to Lord Caitanya directly and receive our means of deliverance but we can do so through our spiritual master, who is sevaka Bhagavan, the servitor God, who himself engages in the service of the Sevya Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya and is eager to re-connect the wandering soul with the Lord through devotional service. Sri Guru epitomizes who he represents. As a matter of fact, he follows the mandate of Lord Caitanya. In Caitanya Caritamrta, Lord Caitanya instructs “Instruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as they are given in the Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land.”\n \n How does the spiritual master see Sri Vyasa Puja? In one sense, it is one of the most difficult services for them. I have heard so from HH Srila Bhakti Caru Swami as well. There is also a very profoundly beautiful Vyasa Puja address to his disciples by Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakura in this connection. As we understand from Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur’s teachings, receiving worship and adulation is unnatural for the pure devotee Vaishnava spiritual master, as in his heart, he reserves that exclusively for his guru, other sadhus and Krsna. However, he receives such worship and adulation following the mandate of Krsna as we understood earlier. So, even this, as much as it goes against his nature, he receives it as a service unto the guru parampara, his Lord and his disciples. He remembers and meditates upon the mercy and love he himself has received from his guru and he sees how his guru and even his disciples are engaging him in service to Krsna. He remains humble and reaffirms his commitment to the guru parampara, his Lord and his disciples.\n \n The spiritual master is not just a conveyer of Krsna’s will: he is the gateway to Krsna, he is the bearer of the descending mercy flowing from Krsna through the guru parampara and ushers it into our life and in return he also receives our devotional service in various ways and delivers it to Krsna up the parampara, the celebration of “his” Sri Vyasa puja being one of our services he delivers. So, if we understand this essential fact as to how he is the gateway to Krsna, how can we do anything but fall at his lotus feet and meditate upon his limitless glories.\n \n Finally, I want to share one example of the deep spiritual attachment a spiritual master has with his disciples and vice versa. Srila Prabhupada had such an attachment for his disciples and his disciples have for him. Beyond the externalities of Sri Vyasa Puja, in many ways the event has the potency to re-kindle such a relationship.\n \n By the mercy of the spiritual master is the mercy of Krishna accessed. So potent and transformational is the spiritual master’s mercy that the sincere disciple feels and remains indebted, lifetime after lifetime. The disciple strives to express that gratitude by dedicating one’s life to the spiritual master’s service.\n \n So, Sri Vyasa Puja is a reminder for us as to why we are a part of this ISKCON movement, to prosecute pure devotional service and to share it with others.\n \n Finally, on this auspicious Sri Vyasa Puja day, let me offer my prostrated obeisances unto the divine lotus feet of HH Srila Radhanath Swami Guru Maharaja, who is a confidential associate of the Senapati Bhakta of Lord Caitanya’s army, Srila Prabhupada. I offer my obeisances to the devotees who commissioned me for this service for my own purification despite having many disqualifications to render this service. I seek the blessings of my god-brothers and god-sisters and their forgiveness as well if my words were inappropriate.\n \n Your insignificant servant of the servants\n - Batu Gopal Das\n And\n - Modini Gopi Devi Dasi\n Hyderabad."

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurudev,\n \n We wander through this world, and by the mercy of the Lord, this world is blessed by the presence of saintly, divine souls — the beloved of the Lord, the beloved of Lord Krishna. Such souls are exceedingly rare and difficult to find, and even more difficult to associate with. They are powerhouses of mercy, kindness, and divine qualities.\n \n How we long to imbibe even a small particle of those qualities — even a small particle of your own divine qualities, dear Gurudev. You walk among us and shower us with all those blessings.\n \n Among your countless beautiful qualities, there is one that shines especially brightly for us: your unlimited mercy. Your mercy manifests in so many ways and in so many forms — each like a precious and incomparable gift.\n \n One of your greatest gifts to us is your time — time granted to you by the Lord, which you so mercifully share with us all. You spend your time connecting us, guiding us, uplifting us.\n \n Your long lectures and teachings, infused with love, care, and compassion, give us life, hope, and knowledge — without which our spiritual journey would be unthinkable. Sometimes, just a few minutes of your time are enough to protect a devotee from the danger of going astray. You never hesitate to walk long distances to visit a disciple in the hospital, or to call and speak with someone in the moment they need you most. The sacrifice of your precious time for our enlightenment is the pinnacle of your mercy.\n \n Even today, we still marvel at the causeless mercy you have shown to us. Although your presence in this world is rare, Krishna allowed our paths to cross, so that ordinary, insignificant, and fallen souls like us could receive a chance — a priceless opportunity. On this auspicious day of your anniversary, we pray that you continue to grant us this chance, and that we may never fail to use it properly.\n \n We pray to hold firmly to your instructions, your love, and your divine lotus feet.\n \n Recently, we heard in one of your lectures that whatever realizations, good qualities, and abilities we possess are not our own; they are lent to us solely for the purpose of helping and serving others. We pray, our beloved Gurudev, that whatever we receive on our spiritual journey may be used wisely, and only for the purpose for which it was intended.\n \n Your servants,\n Bhagavata das \u0026 Jayanti devi dasi"

By the mercy of both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.\"\n \n I have been extremely fortunate to attain the shelter of a bona fide spiritual master such as yourself after wandering in the material world for countless lifetimes, forgetting my service to Krsna.\n But just as pearls thrown before swine cannot appreciate their value, similarly, due to so many conditionings accumulated over countless lifetimes, I am unable to fully take advantage of the most auspicious position of being engaged as a servant that has been offered to me.\n Still, due to association of devotees who are representing teachings of Srila Prabhupada and yourself, and especially hearing your spiritual potent vāni is keeping me engaged in devotional service.\n Maharaj, Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur prays in one of his bhajans,\n kāndiyā kāndiyā jānāiba duḥkha-grāma |\n saṁsāra-anala haite māgiba viśrāma ||\n śuniyā āmāra duḥkha vaiṣṇava ṭhākura |\n āmā’ lāgi’ kṛṣṇe āvedibena pracura ||\n vaiṣṇavera āvedane kṛṣṇa dayāmaya |\n e hena pāmara prati ha’bena sa-daya ||\n \n Although it\u0027s very difficult to come to such a state of conclusion regarding material existence as mentioned here by Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur - because of so many artificial and useless hopes still lingering in my heart - by hearing your potent spiritual sound vibrations, some understanding of this situation has been awakened. And I understand that the only remedy to come out of this and be engaged as a servant of menial servants of the Divine Couple and Their servants is the request of pure devotees like you on our behalf to Srimati Radharani - the pleasure potency of Lord Krishna.\n This same conclusion you expressed in a recent lecture at Sri Govardhan Dham Kartik yatra regarding the story of Indra taking shelter of mother Surabhi.\n Maharaj, I beg for your blessings so that I can strictly follow the teachings you are giving us so mercifully in your lectures, which you said are your personal instructions to all your disciples. You also mentioned that this is exactly how all Śrīla Prabhupāda’s disciples took his words — as personal instructions.\n Maharaj, I would like to mention a few aspects of your life which constantly inspire me.\n 1. Your attachment to chanting the holy names of Lord is astonishing and very inspiring.\n • When someone asked you about your personal Deities, you replied that your chanting beads are your personal Deities.\n • I have heard from devotees that you have never chanted holy names casually in your life - that is how much you value the holy name.\n • When someone asked you about your favourite sweet, you replied that the Holy Name is your favourite sweet - madhuram madhurbhyo\u0027pi.\n 2. Your complete dedication in following the teachings and example set by Srila Prabhupada in all decisions that you take in his service.\n 3. How expertly you teach us to see any situation in our life as an opportunity to express our dedication, devotion, and gratitude to Lord.\n 4. The emphasis that you place on becoming servant of servant of servant of Vaisnavas rather than seeking limelight.\n And there are many more qualities of yours which keep on inspiring us in our lives.\n Maharaj, on this auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja ceremony, I only beg at your Lotus feet to award me strength and sincerity to develop attachment to these three essential principles given by Sri Caitanya Mahaprahu - Nama Ruchi, Vaishnava Seva and Jiva Daya.\n And I beg forgiveness for all my shortcomings in trying to follow your instructions and sincerely put my full endeavour to strive to progress towards your expectations.\n \n Thank you, Maharaj, for who you are, and for everything you have given us.\n \n Your son,\n Bhāgavata Kathā Dāsa"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurudev,\n Please accept my obeisances at your lotus feet.\n \n To write an offering to you is one of the toughest for me. The reasons are many, but the foremost among them is that I am really one of your most insignificant and worthless disciples to have received your grace. And throughout my life, I have been saved repeatedly through your grace. Saved in terms of repeatedly being able to attend the yatras, doing some insignificant services at the local congregation, being able to serve the Pujaris of Sri Sri Lakshmi Narayan, and sometimes serving those doing deity worship on the altar of your beloved Sri Sri RadhaGopinathji. And as I recollect my association with Sri Sri RadhaGopinath mandir, which began roughly about 2 decades ago, I cannot help but get overwhelmed at what an amazing abode of Vaikuntha you have erected. I simply cannot thank you enough for this. When I look back, I only realize how fortunate I have been because of all this. And then I realize how all of this could simply not have been possible without you.\n \n Maharaj, as someone who has been around for so long, I simply have not advanced as your disciple as I should have. I am so spiritually so very lethargic that I always give in to laziness and struggle with spiritual discipline and sincerity. I am surrounded by my amazing wife Madhuri Radhika, who for me is an epitome of sincerity and dedication that a disciple should possess; my mother Saibya dd, who is no different; and particularly my late father Priya Bhakta Prabhu, who left this world last year amidst the chanting of the holy names and who actually saw Srila Prabhupada during his final days in the ICU at Bhaktivendanta hospital. And Srila Prabhupada told my father, “We are going to Vrindavan.” I pray to my father almost daily to infuse me with the sincerity and dedication that he always had towards your instructions, sadhana, and Srimad Bhagwatam.\n \n Dear Gurudev, a dull-headed person that I am, after so long, only now have I learned that the only way to achieve love for Guru and Krsna is to be constantly in touch with their instructions. I feel ashamed of myself when I see the senior devotees and your disciples serving you so lovingly. I wish to be like them, but I simply lack those qualities, especially that of serving you with love and dedication. Thereby, I have started the first step of practicing to listen to Hari Katha daily through your lotus mouth recorded lectures and kirtans and those of Srila Prabhupada. I know that you will simply be more pleased if I hear your beloved Guru Maharaj’s lectures too, along with yours.\n \n Dear Gurudev, I request you to kindly forgive me for my immature, silly, and childish offering. I have simply just poured out my feelings. I just hope, and I pray to Srimati Radharani, that if possible, may you not abandon me due to my silly, fallen nature and behavior.\n May I also request you to kindly grant me the strength, enthusiasm, and sincerity to be able to be in touch with your vaani for the rest of my life. Also, kindly empower me to be of some service to you because, on my own, I’m prone to falldowns, lethargy, and failures.\n Your most insignificant servant,\n Bhaja nitai das"

Your life is a shining beacon for the entire world. Every aspect of your character—your humility, compassion, dedication, tolerance, and unwavering faith—melts our hearts and uplifts our consciousness. Your relentless journey in search of the Absolute Truth is not merely a story; it is a living scripture that inspires, motivates, and gives hope to thousands.\n \n In New Vrindavan, you performed every service alone, worshipped the Deities with such devotion, and maintained spiritual discipline in the harshest conditions. Bathing multiple times in freezing temperatures without any facility for hot water—when the climate was minus four degrees—is unimaginable for us. Yet you accepted everything as the Lord’s arrangement and served without a single complaint. Only someone with love as deep as the ocean and surrender as pure as gold could live like this.\n \n Srila Prabhupada once said that you have descended from the spiritual sky to assist him. Indeed, Maharaj, again and again we feel that you are not an ordinary person. At this age, to sit for long hours without moving, absorbed in service and compassion—that itself is an extraordinary expression of divine empowerment.\n \n Maharaj, we are eternally grateful for everything you have manifested for the upliftment of souls. Your visionary counselor system has become a pillar of spiritual life for so many of us. Through this system, we feel protected, guided, encouraged, and lovingly nurtured. Your senior disciples carry your mood with such purity and sincerity that we naturally feel connected to your mission and become more steady in Krishna consciousness.\n \n We offer our heartfelt gratitude for Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Barsana Eye Camps, the annual Kartik Yatra, and the transcendental Govardhan Ecovillage. Each of these projects reflects your unlimited compassion and tireless efforts to serve humanity. GEV is not merely a replica of Vrindavan—its atmosphere, devotion, and purity make us feel as though we are standing in the actual dham. It nourishes our hearts and gives us a deep spiritual experience every time we visit.\n \n Maharaj, your qualities are countless—this lifetime is far too short to describe even a fraction of them. Every word you speak becomes a guiding principle for us. Every action of yours becomes a lesson. When you dance in kirtan, it reminds us of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Himself. Your one glance fills our hearts with joy, strength, faith, eagerness, and a profound sense of shelter.\n \n I have no qualification, yet I have received your causeless mercy. This is my greatest fortune. Thank you for accepting me despite my many anarthas. Your shelter is my life’s greatest treasure. I pray that I may always follow your instructions sincerely and live in a way that pleases you.\n \n We fervently pray to the Lord to bless you with strong health, long life, and unlimited strength so that you may continue to enlighten the whole world with Krishna-prema through your nectarean teachings.\n \n Maharaj, please bless me that I may carry your mood and mission forward without any ulterior motives—only with sincerity, humility, and devotion.\n Your insignificant servant,\n Bhakti Lila Devi Dasi"

In the beginning, I used to get nourishment by hearing your audio-recorded lectures and then would get the opportunity to come to Chowpatty temple for your classes whenever possible. For two years, I got the opportunity to attend Pune yatra where you answered my questions in the question-and-answer sessions. Then, from 2010 onwards, I was blessed to attend the Kartik yatra whenever it was held.\n Your vaani has been the constant guiding compass in my Krishna consciousness, and I try to hear you regularly as far as possible. Through your lectures, you have been personally guiding me in my Bhakti, and many times you speak to answer the doubts I have or guide me through the anarthas and difficulties I am facing, lifting my consciousness and rectifying my attitude. Also, through the yatra and pastimes lectures, you take us to those holy places and give us entrance into that lila, and then take us out by giving us the wisdom to apply in our daily practical life.\n As it is said in Hindi, “Jal hi jeevan hai,” similarly, “Aapki Vaani hi mere jeevan ka paani hai.” Without hearing your lectures, Bhakti becomes dry for me.\n As food nourishes the body, similarly, your words are the food for thought and contemplation, to digest, apply, and get nourished and strengthened in Bhakti.\n \n Because you carry Vrindavan in your heart,\n Because you have deep, genuine devotion,\n Because you live by the principles of Shikshastakam verses,\n Because you are endowed with all the 26 qualities of Vaishnavas,\n Because you personify deep gratitude,\n Because you have genuine, deep concern for others and your heart is filled with compassion,\n Because you genuinely cry out the holy names in your japa, kirtans, and bhajans,\n Because you fervently pray to Lord and Guru Parampara,\n Because you are serious, sincere, and without ulterior motives, and desire only the pleasure of Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas,\n Because you are a genuine Prabhupada-anuga,\n Because of your strong sadhana,\n Because of your loving Vaishnav dealings and relationships,\n Because of your maturity, realization, broad-mindedness, and ability to connect and touch the hearts of all classes of people and devotees,\n Because of your deep classes, katha, and talks,\n Because of your many, many wonderful qualities, interactions, and exemplary behavior, etc.\n You have checkmated me, you have stolen my heart, and given me an ideal to strive for in my life. You are the role model, the hero of my life.\n Otherwise, I was lost in material life.\n You have picked me up from the ocean of samsara and given me the opportunity to enter into the divine pastimes of Radha Gopinath and Pancha-Tattva.\n I beg you, Guru Maharaj, to bless me so that I can live by your expectations, be an exemplary devotee, a disciple you can be proud of.\n I beg you, Guru Maharaj, to bless me that I can live by the verse trinad api sunicena taror iva sahishnuna….\n And also by the verse na dhanam, na janam, na sundarim, kavitam va…..\n And also by all other verses of Shikshastakam.\n \n Please forgive me, Gurudev, for my hypocrisy, countless mistakes, offenses, laziness, lack of surrender, and gratitude.\n Despite all my faults and shortcomings, please be merciful to me to uplift me and accept me as your insignificant servant of servant and use me as an instrument and make me dance as you want me to dance.\n Please give me the strength to follow your teachings and be a loyal follower of Srila Prabhupada and Guru Parampara.\n Your insignificant servant of servant\n Bhakti Vaibhav Das\n ISKCON Pune NVCC"

I had a deep desire to attend the yatra this year at Govardhan, but due to health and material attachments and problems, we couldn\u0027t attend this year, but I am also looking forward to having your darshans and blessings in GEV this year.\n Maharaj, in one of your lectures on Gajendra, you mentioned that we feel the crocodile lets go for sometime, but actually, that\u0027s not how it is.\n Similarly, in one of the lectures, you mentioned about Kunti Maharani, which is really inspiring, but it feels very difficult to accept material distress. I kindly request you to please give me the strength and blessings to progress in Krishna Consciousness and maintain a balance between material and spiritual life. I also request good health and strength to serve the mission of Srila Prabhupada.\n Maharaj, kindly forgive me for my shortcomings and offenses done knowingly and unknowingly.\n \n Your humble servant,\n Bharat Mandhyan."

I am completely unqualified to glorify you, but your mercy gives me the courage to speak. Whatever little devotion I have is only by your grace.\n Guru Maharaj, your life is a shining example of Srila Prabhupada’s teachings in action.

I will always cherish that moment throughout my life. Your glance, your presence, and your affection felt like the touch of Krishna’s compassion.

Your lectures, your teachings, and the way you deliver Krishna’s message have the power to transform anyone’s heart and purify their thoughts and life.

You said that friendship among devotees is the mercy of Krishna, and truly it is so. Without the association of devotees, one cannot grow in Bhakti. You place great importance on devotee association and always honor your Godbrothers and Godsisters with utmost respect, teaching us through your life what true Vaishnava etiquette is.\n \n Maharaj, I have also heard from your disciples how tolerant, compassionate, and merciful you are toward every living entity.

When I look at my life, I feel deeply what you wrote in The Journey Within:\n“The grace of the guru is the greatest gift in all of creation.”\n\nWithout your causeless mercy, we would remain lost in ignorance, wandering endlessly in the cycle of birth and death. Your teachings have given us direction, purpose, and a gateway to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord.\n\nBy your divine compassion, you have placed us under the shelter of your extraordinary disciples like HG Radheshyam Prabhu, whose guidance continues to shape our efforts here in Seattle. Following their example, more than sixty youth have now been trained in the teachings of Śrīla Prabhupāda — and many more are being touched each year.\nWhen I see the God-family here cooking together, serving together, guiding retreats, and working unitedly for the youth, I remember your words from The Journey Home:\n“Real love is expressed through service.”\n\nThis service connects us to you even from afar. Though we are geographically distant, your presence is felt in every devotee who engages in your mission.\n\nThis year holds a special place in our hearts with your visit to Seattle after nine long years. All the God-brothers and sisters came together as one family to serve you. For me personally, the most unforgettable moment was receiving you at the airport and speaking with you about the Seattle yātrā. You lovingly inquired about our temple services, the youth programs, festivals, HG Hari Vilas Mahārāja’s health, and even about my own family and service.\n\nWhen I mentioned the youth preaching at the University of Washington, your appreciation and encouragement settled deeply into my heart. As you often write:\n“Encouragement is the nourishment of the soul.” Journey Within\n\nI was nervous, overwhelmed, speaking with a pounding heart, but that intimate exchange is etched eternally in my memory. I was especially amazed by your careful attention to every detail, every moment of your schedule — a silent lesson in how a true servant of Śrīla Prabhupāda remains fully absorbed in service.\n\nI am also very grateful to our Seattle God-family for allowing us to host your Vyāsa–pūjā gathering in our home. Your visit filled our house with a spiritual atmosphere that we will never forget. When you spoke to us about the topic, “How to Please the Spiritual Master,” your message pierced our hearts — reminding us of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mood, and echoing what you expressed in The Journey Within:\n“The spiritual master is pleased not by what we do for ourselves, but by what we do for the mission of his Guru.”\n\nThis is your vision - seeing every opportunity as a chance to serve Śrīla Prabhupāda. My prayer at your lotus feet is simple:\nMay we serve you in the way that you most want to be served in your service to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nMay we carry forward your mission with sincerity, unity, and dedication.\nAs you write beautifully in The Journey Home:\n“When we live for a higher purpose, every moment becomes sacred.”\n\nOn this sacred day of your Vyāsa–pūjā, I pray at the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā–Gopīnātha that They bestow upon you long life, health, strength, and the continued ability to uplift the hearts of countless souls of this world.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nBraja Kripa Dasa, Mohini Sundari DD, Tulasi Priya, Manjari Priya"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n \n My beloved Guru Maharaj, despite all my disqualifications, I am humbly requesting your blessings and compassionate mercy so that I can practically attempt to express our gratitude through our heartfelt words, body, and mind for the most wonderful gift, \"the seed of pure, unalloyed devotional service,\" which you have mercifully planted in our hearts. Guru Maharaj, every year on this auspicious day of your Vyasa Puja, your glories are revealed more and more, which makes us feel more and more indebted to your lotus feet. When I hear your divine qualities from your Godbrothers and your senior disciples, I feel so fortunate to be a recipient of your mercy. I thank Srila Prabhupada from the bottom of my heart for giving me such a magnificent spiritual master. Guru Maharaj, by your causeless mercy, I am trying to hear your Vani every day without fail, and that gives so much nourishment, so many practical instructions to meditate on and to live a life with real purpose. I am very grateful to HG Rasaraj Gopa Prabhu for sharing amrita droplets in the form of your divine, nectarean speech and quotes on a day-to-day basis that really help us to understand the importance of different auspicious days, the significance of Vaishnava festivals, etc., from your Sri Mukha.\n \n In Srimad Bhagavatam, during the conversation between Nimi Maharaj and one of the Nava Yogendras named Prabuddha, after the famous verse, \"Tasmad gurum prapadyeta...\" 11.3.21, there is a series of verses about how a disciple should conduct themselves upon receiving initiation, such as the disciple should learn from the spiritual master the science of devotional service, namely hearing, chanting; should learn to disassociate the mind from everything material; should learn to deal properly with all living beings; should learn to be satisfied in any material situation, etc., and so on. Guru Maharaj, you have been cultivating all of us by injecting these aspects through your divine instructions, teachings, and personal conduct for so many decades, and especially in Karthik Yatra, we get the full package of these learning aspects in a condensed form. How mercifully your holiness teaches, trains, and nurtures so many disciples at one place by engaging all of us in profuse hearing, chanting, dancing, serving devotees, etc. We are truly indebted to you, Guru Maharaj, life after life, for not just giving the seed of pure devotional service but also, like a very merciful gardener, always being anxious to nurture it. Guru Maharaj, I need your blessings to understand your mercy deeply and become sincere on this path. I pray to the Lord and to Srila Prabhupada that I keep receiving your divine mercy in the years to come and continue serving you to your satisfaction! During this Karthik Yatra, once again, I was struck with wonder at the way your holiness churns the tattva and Krishna Lila, and co-relates them with practical instructions in our day-to-day life. It is simply inconceivable. Thank you, Guru Maharaj, for giving us shelter in this glorious Guru-Shishya Parampara, in spite of all our disqualifications. Guru Maharaj, you have given us everything siksha, diksha, sadhana, sastra, dhama, devotees\u0027 association, naam kirtan, Krishna prasadam needed to go back to Godhead.\n \n nama-śreṣṭhaṁ manuṁ api śaci-putraṁ atra svarūpaṁ\n rūpaṁ tasyāgrajaṁ uru-purīṁ mathurīṁ goṣṭhavatīṁ\n rādhā-kuṇḍaṁ giri-varaṁ aho! rādhikā-mādhavasam\n prāpto yasya prasādāt kr̥payā śrī-guruṁ tam nato \u0027smi\n \n Mukta Charita by Srila Raghunath Das Goswami\n \n Begging for your causeless mercy to develop the right attitude, right motivation, and right desires which may please you and all whom you love in your divine service to Srila Prabhupada. I also beg for your mercy so that I can sincerely follow my vow of initiation and can become an insignificant instrument in this glorious mission of Srila Prabhupada under your shelter. Due to my impure heart and limited ability, I am unable to glorify your divine qualities. Please forgive me, Guru Maharaj, but always keep me under your shelter and under the guidance of your faithful disciples. I do not want anything, Gurudeva, just to serve your lotus feet. Please grant me this desire and accept my imperfect service.\n \n Your unworthy grateful spiritual son,\n Praying for Your Mercy,\n Braja Prakash Das\n Kanhaiyadesh Kuwait"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurumaharaja,\n Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n All glories to you.\n On this auspicious occasion of your appearance day, I am reminded of how your presence on this planet is a blessing to all your disciples and all the fortunate people who come in contact with you. How you extend yourself to lovingly and selflessly reciprocate with each one of us is simply amazing. I pray that I may not waste the opportunity in this life to improve in my attempts at devotional service under your guidance.\n Watching the video recordings of you speaking in Vrindavan for this year\u0027s Kartik yatra was so inspiring: your enthusiasm and absorption in Krishna’s pastimes are so great that they seem to manifest from the sound vibration of your voice. I was reminded of SB 1.2.3: like Sukadeva Goswami spoke Srimad Bhagavatam out of his great compassion for gross materialists struggling to cross over the darkest regions of material existence, you speak Krishna lila and teachings from scriptures in such a palatable way so that, not only devotees can relish the nectar of your words, but also gross materialists like myself can get attracted to such wonderful narrations and forget sense enjoyment for the time being. One can get a glimpse of how amazing bhakti must be by observing you repeating the same lilas for years with ever-fresh enthusiasm. I pray that I may taste even a drop of that bliss that you are always immersed in.\n Thank you for keeping me in Krishna consciousness.\n Whenever I find it difficult to cooperate with devotees who have different moods in Krishna consciousness, I try my best to serve them as a service to you, because I know how much it pleases you when we put aside our false ego and try to selflessly serve devotees even when it’s not so pleasant. As you said in class, as long as we are not pure devotees, the enthusiasm to serve may be an austerity; only when we come to higher stages of bhakti, enthusiasm becomes natural. Out of your great compassion for all living entities, you speak such encouraging words for those who are still struggling with anarthas and cannot understand how bhakti is not about themselves but about the Lord. How rare to find a pure devotee like you who is not interested in being great, but only concerned in making Krishna great by spreading His glories! How rare to find a special soul like you, just happy to serve and uplift others! Like Srila Prabhupada, who went through so much discomfort just for others’ benefit, to spread Krishna consciousness. This is the standard of great souls in the mood of Prahlada Maharaja, although they are perfect in their Krishna consciousness, out of their compassion for the lost souls in the material world, they try their best to carry as many as possible back to the spiritual world with them. Their efforts are as glorious as their lives.\n Just like your life is, completely dedicated to the service of God. Materialistic people struggle throughout their entire lives to achieve things they are doomed to lose, but you simply serve God and His devotees and, by doing that, you are the richest person in the world because your wealth is eternal. You said in class, what is the value of things? They have value only as much as we can use them to express our love to Krishna in devotional service. You gave the example of the microphone, how even a material thing can be used in inspiring people to chant the holy name. The same thing comes into my mind when I make flower garlands for Sri Sri Panchatattva and Srila Prabhupada’s murti here: flowers have such short lives, they wilt so quickly; if they don’t get offered to the Lord, what is the use of their beauty?\n I pray I may become a better disciple and be able to enthusiastically follow your instructions, being firmly convinced that nothing except your instructions can be of any help to me, no matter how logical my mental concoctions may sound.\n I pray to fully take shelter of the holy name and the sacred sound vibration of your voice.\n Your servant,\n Brajadevi Devi Dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Dear Gurudev,\n \n\n Please accept my humble obeisances unto your lotus feet.\n \n All glories to Srila Prabhupada, all glories to you.\n \n Today, I am having mixed feelings, both very happy and enthusiastic and at the same time very sad. Happy and enthusiastic to glorify your unlimited qualities, which are an ocean of limitless qualities; even a small drop of such qualities can purify one’s existence in this material world. I am feeling sad that I am unable to imbibe such purifying qualities in my life due to my shortcomings and lack of determination and ignoring small, small details of Bhakti.\n \n In one of the offerings to Srila Prabhupada, you said:\n Srila Prabhupada said once, “Sometimes a person picks up a stick, then picks up a gourd, a pumpkin, and then picks up a wire and then puts them all together to make an instrument. He said that’s the way how I started this movement. I just picked up you… and you… and you and put you all together and told you to preach \u0026 chant the holy name.” Srila Prabhupada, what did he have to work with? They were not people from Brahman families; he just took people who were meat-eaters, who were taking so many intoxicants, gambling their lives away, who were confused. But Srila Prabhupada transformed them into wonderful Vaishnavas and within a couple of years, by his example, by his compassion \u0026 by his purity, he gave them the power to go out to other countries in other parts of America where Krsna consciousness was absolutely unknown and start centers \u0026 all of them were flourishing.\n \n Gurudev, in the footsteps of Srila Prabhupada, you also picked many young boys who were IITians, engineers, MBAs, doctors, professionals, stock market professionals, highly educated, and many other classes of people regardless of their caste and creed and gave them Krishna consciousness in such a way that they have surrendered their life for the mission of Srila Prabhupada and dedicated their life in preaching to many countries of the world. We can now see that they have transformed the lives of many people, especially youths, throughout India and many other countries.\n \n I feel very humbled when I hear the struggle you have faced throughout your life, from Richard to H.H. Radhanath Swami Maharaj. There were many occasions in my life when things were not as per my expectations and everything seemed to be very gloomy and doubtful, but every time you have dispelled the darkness by your Vāṇī. Hearing your lectures cuts out all the doubts and sadness or dryness in devotional life and gives fresh energy or enthusiasm to progress in Bhakti.\n I am very much attracted by your quality of giving respect to others and expecting no respect for oneself, which has touched the hearts of many people of this world in many fields, whether it is businessmen, film artists, musicians, professionals, and other classes of men.\n \n In one of the lectures of your glorification, I heard that you had specially instructed to keep the Vyas āsanā big, 3-4 seater, not just for a single person. When your godbrothers visit you in Sri Sri Radha Gopinath temple, you tell them to sit next to you, and you first glorify each and every guest devotee who is seated beside you on the Vyas āsanā. This apparently simple thing is very deep and filled with so many instructions and deep lessons which attract the mercy of the assembled Vaishnavas. It is *amāninā māna-dena, kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ*. This is the reason how you are the personification of *amāninā māna-dena, kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ*. And when someone asked you why you are not carrying any deity of the Lord with you, you said, “Harinām is my deity; I always carry them with me.” This shows the faith and conviction on the holy name, which you carry all over the world and distribute by your beautiful *kirtans* and lectures and your dealings with other devotees. It is because of this conviction on the holy name that you have attracted thousands of conditioned souls in India and other countries to follow Krishna Consciousness and chant the holy name of the Lord.\n Gurudev, I humbly pray at your lotus feet that I can develop such faith and conviction towards the holy name and distribute the holy name to others and can remain a tiny, insignificant servant to my authorities at the local center and do whatever they expect from me without any ulterior motives.\n \n One more quality of yours is attracting me very much, which is absorption in hearing or chanting the glories of the Lord. Many times, we have heard from other senior disciples that in the initial Yatras when you took 25-50 devotees to Dhām Yātrā, you had no schedules fixed before going to the Yātrā. You got absorbed in Krishna Kathā that there was no time limit. You gave classes for long hours, 5-7 hours of classes in the Yātrā, where devotees got lunch at the time of dinner. These were the most enlightening and joyful experiences of most of the devotees present in those Yātrās. I have heard from devotees that the same absorption you have when you visit Goverdhan Eco Village. You relish the beautiful Vrindavan forest, Yamuna, and the six Goswami temples, especially Sri Sri Radha Madan Mohan, which is the most dearest to your heart.\n \n This reminds me about the beautiful verse of Guruastakam, which we daily sing in morning prayer:\n sri-radhika-madhavayor aparamadhurya-\n lila guna-rupa-namnam\n pratikshanasvadana-lolupasya\n vande guroh sri-charanaravindam\n The spiritual master is always eager to hear and chant about the unlimited conjugal pastimes of Sri Sri Radhika and Madhava, and about Their qualities, names, and forms. The spiritual master aspires to relish these at every moment. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.\n \n Gurudev, due to my uncontrolled mind and senses, I am unable to absorb myself in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. My mind is so restless that I cannot fix it in doing one thing at a time. I humbly pray at your lotus feet that a little drop of this quality of yours I can grasp and imbibe in my life, which would give my restless mind and senses a protected shelter of Harinām and the glories of the Lord and His devotees.\n \n Today, on this auspicious occasion of Vyas Puja Celebration, I pray to all assembled Vaishnavas that I can remain a loyal servant of my Śikṣā Guru and Dīkṣā Guru and discharge my duties wholeheartedly without any adulterated motives.\n \n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Caitanya Kishore Das."

        "Your Offering ":  "My Most Beloved Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my prostrated obeisances at your lotus feet.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada, Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga.\n\nIn the month of January this year, my mother was facing some health challenges and was hospitalized. During those days, I found myself constantly brooding over our situation, lamenting that I did not have the means to help her as I wished. In that state of helplessness, I began praying intensely — even yearning to become wealthy — forgetting what my real aspiration in life should truly be. Honestly speaking, Guru Maharaj, I confess that I do have the habit of praying like this at times.\n\nOne day, while I was in the hospital, in one of your lectures which I was hearing you narrated a pastime that touched and instructed my heart deeply. It was exactly what I needed to hear at that time, and I had never heard that pastime before. You spoke about a poor South Indian Dravidian brahmana who was living in such abject poverty that his relatives and society had abandoned him. He was extremely thin and sickly due to starvation, unable to obtain even his daily food. Overcome by hunger and despair, he went to Jagannatha Puri and stood before Lord Jagannatha, praying that if the Lord did not make him wealthy, he would end his life. The next day, he came again before the Lord and vowed that if Lord Jagannatha did not make him wealthy within seven days, he would end his life.\n\nThree days passed, yet nothing changed. Again, he approached the Lord and repeated his threat, giving Him four more days. But even after that, his condition remained the same. Finally, in utter hopelessness, the brahmana went to the ocean, resolved to end his life by drowning.\n\nAs he was about to enter the water, he suddenly beheld a majestic personality emerging from the sea — so vast and resplendent that the sight left him speechless. As this divine figure approached the shore, His form gradually became smaller, apt for this age. Filled with awe and curiosity, the brahmana approached him and tried to speak, though initially, the personality gave only brief and distant replies. Eventually, as the brahmana poured out his heart about his misery and intention to end his life, the personality became compassionate and told him that the only solution for his suffering was to see the smiling face of the Lord.\n\nThe divine personality then revealed himself — He was Vibhisana. He said, \"I am going to take darshan of the Lord. You can come along.\" And they walked towards Totagopinath temple where Lord Caitanya was with His associates. The brahmana was astonished and said that Lord Jagannatha, the Lord of the Universe, resided in the temple, but where were they going. Upon seeing Vibhisana, Lord Caitanya became filled with joy and affectionately called Him near, seemingly ignoring the poor brahmana. The two conversed lovingly, and during their exchange, Lord Caitanya told Vibhishan that this other brahmana who was sitting a little distance away and he spoke loud enough so that that brahmana could hear him. \u0027He\u0027s starving. He\u0027s suffering from terrible poverty and he\u0027s been rejected by everyone. Why? It is due to his past sins. Whatever comes upon us is due to our own karma. And this fool, he is blaming God for his miseries. That is the condition of people in this world today,\u0027 Lord Caitanya said, \u0027They want to blame God for what they have brought upon themselves. And whatever good they get, whatever successes, they want to take the credit and forget Krsna altogether. Is this not the situation of people in this world? Whatever goes wrong, why is God doing this to me? And whatever goes right, see what I have done. But the pleasures and the pains, the happiness and distress that comes upon us in this world, it is all the reactions of our past karma. We are responsible. But this miserable soul is simply blaming the Lord. Not only blaming the Lord, but he has come to Jagannath Puri to harass Lord Jagannath. To make ultimatums to Lord Jagannath. But I tell you, Vibhishan, you should save him. And you should give him immense glory.\u0027\n\n\u0027As you say, my Lord,\u0027 said Vibhishan. Lord Caitanya said, \u0027Bring him back to South India and give him great wealth, real wealth.\u0027 Vibhishan offered his obeisances and they walked out. And the brahmana walked out with him.\n\nThat brahmana, he asked Vibhishan, \u0027Who was that? Who is that sannyasi giving you orders, calling you Vibhishan? And that order he gave you, very nice, but who was he giving you that order?\u0027 And Vibhishan said, \u0027You are such a fool. That was Lord Jagannath.\u0027\n\nThe brahmana said, \u0027You told me you were going to bring me to Jagannath and you just brought me to the sannyasi\u0027s house and you didn\u0027t even go to Jagannath\u0027s temple at all.\u0027 He said, \u0027You\u0027re a fool. That is Lord Jagannath. He has assumed the beautiful golden form of Sri Gauranga Mahaprabhu to give what no other incarnation has given, pure love of God, the greatest wealth.\u0027\n\nSo the brahmana, he said, \u0027That\u0027s Lord Jagannath, so humble, so kind, so merciful. Please bring me to him. Bring me to him.\u0027 So Vibhishan came back. And Lord Caitanya asked, \u0027Why have you returned?\u0027 And he said that this brahmana wants to say something to you.\n\nAnd the brahmana with tears in his eyes fell at the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya and surrendered and said, \u0027I am such a selfish person. I am such a fool. I\u0027m diseased and I was asking you for a diet of food that was only going to increase the miseries of my disease. And I was not willing to ask you for the proper medicine. You are the supreme physician. I am an ignorant soul. But now I have come to take shelter of your lotus feet and accept the real medicine that you have given.\u0027\n\nSri Caitanya Mahaprabhu told him, \u0027Whatever your karma may be, don\u0027t mind the happiness and distress because even if you have wealth that does not in any way guarantee that you will not suffer as much as a poor man, and even if you\u0027re poor, that does not mean you will not enjoy as much as a rich man. That is the way this world is. So tolerate both happiness and distress, which will come by their own arrangement. And fix your mind on the Lord and take the medicine of the chanting of the Holy Name. And you follow in the footsteps of Vibhishan and he will give you the greatest wealth, the wealth that your heart is longing for, and what is that wealth? The purushartha siromani, the greatest of all treasures, the treasure of love of God, Krsna-Prema.\u0027\n\nWhen I heard this pastime from your lotus lips, Guru Maharaj, it shook me deeply. I was amazed and humbled by its perfect timing. Through your vani, you rescued me from my self-centered desires and reminded me of the true purpose of life — to serve, to surrender, and to depend upon the mercy of the Lord. You gave me solace when I needed it.\n\nSince that day, this pastime has remained engraved in my heart. It continues to inspire and guide me whenever worldly anxieties arise, especially concerning money. I am endlessly grateful to you, Guru Maharaj, for giving me shelter through your divine vani.\n\nI pray that I may continue to hear your instructions attentively, purify my heart, and in some small and insignificant way, be of service to my Godbrothers and Godsisters who are sincerely assisting you in fulfilling the mission of Srila Prabhupada. Just as the brahmana received the mercy of the Lord through the association of Vibhisana, I too pray that I may always remain in the association of sincere Godbrothers and Godsisters — which is, in truth, your mercy. In their association, may I transform my heart for good and learn to serve with genuine humility.\n\nAt your lotus feet,\nYour insignificant son,\nCaitanya Purushottam das"

Let us meditate on how you practically embody the teachings of our ācāryas. While there are countless examples of your divine compassion and grace, we humbly choose to recall a few specific incidents. Your life is the perfect commentary on the śikṣāṣṭakam, teaching us what it truly means to be a servant of Kṛṣṇa.\n Our purpose in recounting these is twofold: firstly, to glorify your transcendental qualities which effortlessly attract the hearts of all living entities; and secondly, for our own purification, as reflecting upon your perfect character inspires us to sincerely follow your instructions.\n \n 1. Radical Humility and Universal Respect\n Maharaj, one of the most profound qualities that illuminates your personality is your profound humility tṛṇād api sunīcena. You do not merely preach respect; you live it by honoring every soul, regardless of their external designation or religious background. This was exemplified during your treatment in Kerala, when you consistently offered pranāms to your Muslim driver, concluding with full daṇḍavats at the airport.\n This act speaks volumes. The elderly driver, accustomed to serving the world’s most powerful kings and sheikhs, broke down in tears, stating that no one had ever shown him such profound respect. In that moment, you demonstrated that your vision is purely spiritual, transcending material designations of caste, creed, or wealth. It inspires me to cultivate the necessary humility to practice mānadena in all my interactions.\n \n 2. Unwavering Absorption in the Holy Name Verse 1: ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ...\n Maharaj, Your life is a profound example of dedicated absorption in kīrtana and japa which is the foundational instruction of the Śikṣāṣṭakam ceto-darpana-marjanam.\n Reports from your close servants confirm that they have observed you chanting throughout the night on many occasions, yet you still begin your morning program the next day without fail. Furthermore, before yatras travels or important engagements, you are known to sit alone with a harmonium and sing for four or five hours. This demonstrates that your \"head and heart are always dedicated to Kṛṣṇa.\" The accounts of your tireless dedication to the Holy Name, chanting through the night, motivate me daily.\n \n 3. Unwavering Loyalty and Causeless Devotion Verse 4: na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ... bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi\n Your unwavering loyalty to the spiritual master\u0027s body ISKCON, even when it is challenging, perfectly embodies Verse 4 of śikṣāṣṭakam “na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ... bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi”.\n During a Vyasa Puja celebration, a young lady who had left ISKCON due to turmoil and financial instability confronted You, Maharaj, challenging why You had not left ISKCON despite its troubles. You immediately replied by referencing Śrīla Prabhupāda’s statement that ISKCON is his body. You acknowledged that the body may be \"bleeding\" and have \"some wounds,\" but as a son, it is Your responsibility not to leave Your father when he is injured, but rather to care for him. You stressed, \"I could never ever leave ISKCON because Śrīla Prabhupāda said ISKCON is his body.\" This act is the ultimate demonstration of your dedication, proving that your spiritual identity is defined entirely by your service, regardless of external difficulties or personal cost. Maharaj, your profound commitment to Śrīla Prabhupāda\u0027s body, ISKCON, redefined what loyalty means for me.\n \n 4. The Transforming Power of Unconditional Affection\n Your pure, unreserved love has the power to melt away any contamination and instantly transform a person\u0027s life. We saw this with the slum youth who confronted you with such harsh and vulgar language. Instead of reacting, you simply embraced him. He broke down weeping, and the change was instant. The very next day, he started coming to the temple, and for three years, he would place a rose outside your door every time he visited. This story shows us that your genuine warmth and a single, non-judgmental embrace can completely re-route a soul\u0027s journey. This incident motivates me to always lead with empathy rather than critique.\n Conclusion\n \n Maharaj, I pray to the Supreme Lord for Your divine health, long life, and continued inspiration to guide countless souls. We pray that we may internalize these teachings by trying to serve others without distinction and with genuine respect.\n Please empower us to follow your instructions so that we may one day be worthy to stand as tiny particles of dust at your lotus feet.\n May Your blessings shower upon me and my family, enabling us to make spiritual progress and dedicate our lives to Your service."

You are very important to me, and I would like to be nearer to you, but unfortunately, this is my fate for now—to be always far from you. I keep myself inspired by you, by your words and actions. Only you can keep me this way, strong in my purpose, even when you are far from me. My life has become very hard, and the world has become very empty without your presence. After leaving Chowpaty and coming back to my country, it was very hard at first to live separated from you. But after some time, I became used to living without you. However, nowadays, it seems like I live in a desert. I eat just to keep my life going, and in general, life does not have much taste.\n \n The biggest pleasure that I have in this life is to be connected with you and to be attached with all my force to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, searching for something that can make you happy, something that helps propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, something that helps devotees, even if it is very simple. I dream a lot about it. I dream to build a place where I can live happily with devotees in this dark world, a place that can be a ray of hope here in my country. Now it is just a dream, but I am working hard to have a small chance and make it real. This is the way I think I can satisfy you, and my only focus and hope is to be able to do it for you one day. This is my sincere desire, and I hope this can make you happy with me.\n \n Your disciple and eternal servant,\n Chaitanya Chandrodaya Das."

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n I am in deep thought, probably too much. I was reminded by the story of you sitting on that rock on the verge of the river Ganges. You decided to meditate in deep and contemplative prayer for a considerable time. While you were looking for a relationship and deeper purpose with God, I wonder now: were you wrestling with this same question of how deep the purification must go?\n \n I sometimes feel like I am that being from the Beatles\u0027 Yellow Submarine. He\u0027s a real nowhere man - existing but not fully present, creating but disconnected from the creation, contemplating endlessly without resolution.\n \n “In the Beatles\u0027 animated film Yellow Submarine, the song \"Nowhere Man\" is performed by the Beatles as they encounter the character Jeremy Hillary Boob Ph.D. in the \"Sea of Nothing,\" also known as \"Nowhere Land.\" The lyrics, \"He\u0027s a real Nowhere Man, Sitting in his Nowhere Land, Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody,\" are sung about Jeremy, who lives in isolation and is described as a \"nowhere man\" due to his lack of direction and purpose. Jeremy is portrayed as an eccentric, flamboyant being with a blue face, pink ears, and a fluffy tail, who speaks mostly in rhyme and is deeply engrossed in creating art and writing books, though he claims never to read his own reviews. The song was originally written by John Lennon for the Rubber Soul album in 1965 and later featured in the film, where it serves as a thematic introduction to Jeremy\u0027s character. The character\u0027s name, Jeremy Hillary Boob Ph.D., is a whimsical creation that reflects the song\u0027s theme of existential detachment.”\n \n As Krishna conscious as I try to be, and for many years, I have for quite some time been looking at what my mind and intelligence are doing and what Krishna and you have been trying to guide me into. As you know, I have always had a strong calling to fulfill instructions given to me years ago to serve in devotee care. In doing so, I have taken it upon myself to study deeper the aspects of our mind and body and what causes us to become triggered. I have even written a book about it, and it is currently being reviewed. I have received encouraging feedback.\n \n These internal dives are necessary. I am drawn now to the thoughts and emotions you may have experienced while sitting on that rock overlooking the Ganges, day after day. At that time, I believe you must have been asking in so many ways: who is God and what is my purpose?\n \n I too am asking now: how deep do Krishna and you wish to take me? What have I done to end up in this position? I know I have committed all kinds of sins and offenses, and yet here I am. The discovery and purification are both enlightening and challenging, where I must pull myself into focus as to what is rising to the surface and what is being revealed, avoiding traps of illusion and the blind spots that I, devotees, and the wider society have been subjected to. It seems ongoing because I have wanted to uncover this. However, I am too naive and feel very much like a neophyte devotee because I do not consider myself so learned in the sastras. I do feel like I have understood the essence of Krishna consciousness, though. I am perhaps running before I can walk, though as I present at the end, I have felt an increasing urgency to deepen my prayers and help myself and devotees avoid the pitfalls of the mind and senses further. In doing so, I am hoping we will be able to strengthen our ability to avoid offenses and serve as Srila Prabhupada wanted us to do in his instructions and writings.\n \n It may be questioned why a devotee is put into such tribulation by the Personality of Godhead. The answer is that this kind of arrangement by the Lord is just like a father sometimes becoming unkind to his sons. Please read this section to the end - Krsna Book Ch 88 - The Deliverance of Lord Siva.\n \n As devotees, we are covered in our awakening.\n Early on, not long after joining the movement, I understood you, other sannyasis, and great surrendered souls go through so much purification. Some may think that your life in this world is floating on a cloud with an entourage of disciple followers and well-wishers.\n Though I know for you it\u0027s more about having to tolerate and endure all the attention. All eyes are on you, and so many expectations are made upon you. On one level, you have perfected life, and that is what we are all aiming for, to follow in your footsteps, but to live the life that you do, I believe I have many more lives to attain such Krishna consciousness.\n \n I don\u0027t fully realize, Maharaj, what you go through, and yet I know you have endured limiting and ongoing health issues. And it\u0027s that sixth portion of our karma that often rings in the back of my mind that you take on board from each disciple, and you have so many disciples.\n \n Maharaj, you\u0027ve seen it all before, and the Vietnam war draft. As you are aware, the world governments have put out alerts that there may be a third world war. They are goading it to happen, of course. It is inevitable, as these are reactions to the accumulative reactions to animal slaughter.\n \n This external chaos mirrors something of the internal work required. Thankfully, I understand the medical aspects of brain fog, which causes these deep and challenging thoughts and emotions. So, this is both an existential battle and a biological reality happening simultaneously. The two are not separate; the purification process operates through both channels. Therefore, I am not going to get overly alarmed, though it has been lack of sleep over years that has intensified it and the stress that comes from it.\n \n What do you do, Maharaj, when all these emotions rise to the surface and feel overwhelming? Perhaps I may be answering my own question as to what you\u0027d say? And that is to take continued shelter of Krishna and the holy name.\n That I\u0027m doing, Maharaj. But I am putting into writing what I truly need: would you watch over me and help me navigate this period where the biological and spiritual purification are converging so intensely? I\u0027m not a nowhere man, though it feels that way when the world seems so cruel and the internal work so demanding.\n This might not be the place to present such details, though these are grave concerns I have for the position of the movement right now and my service, and what I should best direct myself in.\n \n My heartfelt prayers for your extensive services to gloriously continue and for the care and support for your good health.\n Your servant,\n Chaitanya Jivan Das"

You were personally present in the temple just before I left for Mayapur and also Vrindavan for the first time in my life. I really felt empowered by your presence.

        "Your Offering ":  "Dearest His Holiness Radhanath Swami,\n Lord Chaitanya descended out of His causeless mercy\n To bestow what no incarnation had offered before to all the unworthy—\n The most elevated mellow of conjugal love,\n The love of the gopīs which is selfless, true love.\n Yet I would not know Lord Chaitanya if it wasn’t for you.\n You gave me access to His teachings of the highest truth.\n You are Lord Chaitanya’s representative, resplendent with the radiance of molten gold,\n And you are my spiritual master who has removed my blindfold,\n So my eyes can behold the original spiritual master Lord Nityānanda so perfect.\n You’ve delivered me to Their feet so I can offer Them loving respect.\n Unless one is favored by a pure devotee, they cannot attain Krishna Bhakti.\n I have only been saved from material existence by your śakti.\n The only way to not succumb to our lower nature is to take full shelter of pure devotees—\n Otherwise our material senses can be carried away by the breeze.\n You are such a liberated Vaiṣṇava, but you are more than that.\n Bhakti Charu Mahārāja said you are an eternally liberated associate of the Lord, and that is a fact.\n He said you have descended to assist Śrīla Prabhupāda in his divine mission,\n And Śrīla Prabhupāda recognized you at the Bombay pandal and gave you permission\n To touch his feet and told you to sit with him on the stage.\n You have descended to help him liberate all of us from our material cage.\n The story of Ghanashyam Baba in The Journey Home reveals\n One of your most primary teachings and important appeals:\n “tṛṇād api sunīcena” — more humble than a blade of grass.\n You have taught us to imbibe this verse as our first test in class.\n We have to become more tolerant than a tree\n If we want to be a devotee and have the key\n To chant Hare Krishna constantly — we need to wear this verse around our neck\n And know that in Krishna’s creation we are but a tiny speck.\n You say:\n \n “A humble heart is one that gives no resistance to the natural flow of grace,\n It is similar to how small we feel in relation to the ocean when we stand in that beautiful place.”\n \n You teach us that:\n \n “We all have infinite importance because God loves each of us,\n And we only need to be grateful for His love” and decide to discuss\n His loving pastimes and glories and chant His Name,\n And live in harmony with His will, making that our life’s aim.\n \n A tree bears the sun in the summer and gives its shade.\n You have sacrificed more for us, and your love will never fade.\n You want us to respect others and never desire to be respected—\n I see this teaching you, yourself, have perfected.\n Everywhere you go in the world, people praise you,\n But every day you see yourself as an insignificant servant of Prabhupāda — that is your view.\n You have personally instructed us all in your lectures, shedding gallons of blood,\n And listening to your lectures inundates my heart with a transcendental flood.\n You have personally instructed all of us to sincerely chant our sixteen rounds.\n At initiation, you explained that the Holy Name purifies us — whether pure or impure backgrounds.\n You have personally instructed all of us to follow the four regulative principles strictly.\n Prabhupāda said doing so will give us transcendental victory.\n You have instructed all of us to serve Prabhupāda’s mission as the servant of the servant.\n To follow this instruction in my heart is a desire so fervent.\n Prabhupāda told us we can please him by how we cooperate—\n That is the mood you have created in all of your projects, and that is why they are great.\n You wanted to live in Vṛndāvana your whole life and serve,\n But your visa expired, and in America you saw Prabhupāda and observed\n Prabhupāda saying we can realize Vṛndāvana by serving the spiritual master’s mission—\n And you decided to give up your life in Vṛndāvana ambition.\n You surrendered to Prabhupāda and selflessly served at New Vṛndāvana,\n And it was so many years until you went back to India and Vṛndāvana.\n But Vṛndāvana was always in your heart, and you wanted to do good\n For India’s people, and you remembered at the border you had said you would.\n Now look at all you have done!\n Midday meals, Bhaktivedanta Hospital, and Barsana Eye Camps take care of everyone.\n The Chowpatty temple has won the hearts of everyone in the world.\n Govardhan Eco Village is Vṛndāvana manifesting from your heart to give us the spiritual world.\n You have given pure Vṛndāvana in a way that new Westerners can relate.\n These Westerners don’t know that coming to GEV leads to pure devotion as their fortunate fate.\n Krishna has personally told you how He wants you to do all of these things.\n One time you answered my question in a way that pulled my heartstrings.\n I asked:\n \n “When we are in separation from you and praying to you, do you know\n How much we are trying to love you although we have so much to grow?”\n \n You replied:\n \n “Krishna knows everything, that is so,\n But He tells me always what He wants me to know.”\n \n I asked you:\n \n “When we get back to the spiritual world, will we remember who we all were here?”\n You said:\n “We will, but only the good things from our together years.”\n \n I pray to serve you in this world and the spiritual world eternally.\n I want to serve you with all my heart — both externally and internally.\n I will never know the mind or the plan of you, the pure devotee,\n But I pray that you reveal what you desire of me.\n You told me in Alachua that to serve Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mission is your life project,\n And wherever I serve his mission, I am serving you and your project.\n But I constantly sob in tears of separation,\n So I pray you can live in my heart with no cessation.\n I pray you can use me as your puppet to assist you in your service to Śrīla Prabhupāda\n And make me beat like your mṛdaṅga.\n Please make me dance as you wish me to dance—\n Then maybe someday I’ll receive your pleased side-long glance.\n I beg you to cleanse me of my pride and selfish desire\n So I can contribute to ISKCON’s transcendental choir.\n I pray that by your mercy I realize my own insignificance\n And make my only desire and joy in life your happiness.\n I pray I can hear your desire in the innermost chamber of my heart\n And that you make my life your piece of art.\n I pray to be the servant of the servant of your servants as my only endeavor—\n This is my only chance to serve Rādhā and Krishna forever.\n Your servant,\n Champakalata Sakhi devi dasi"

Indeed, this provided both of us with renewed determination to render service to the mission of Sarila Prabhupada.\n\nDuring your October visit to London, in your presence and the senior management leaders at the Manor in Srila Prabhupada’s darshan room, the Sankirtan team offered the result of the Bhadra campaign – 546 sets of Srimad Bhagavatam sets distributed. Once again, we were very much blessed by your support and presence and this served to enliven the Sankirtan devotees to dedicate themselves to Srila Prabhupada’s mission with greater enthusiasm.\n\nOur main service remains distributing books given to us by Srila Prabhupada. While I have accompanied devotees to outdoor locations like Wembley Central Station, Wembley Ealing Road and many other locations, including Monthly Sankirtan Festivals, Prema Vilasini devi dasi has rendered service at the book table in the Sri Krishna Haveli. Her easy-going nature has brought several newcomers into the Sankirtan service.\n\nI continue to perform my Monday midday service washing pots and cleaning up after The Raj Bhaga offering at the Manor. Prema Vilasini devi dasi continues to help pujaris cook for the Deities at Bhaktivedanta Manor and the Soho Temple, while continuing her fortnightly service in the pujari room at the Manor and Soho temples.\n\nLooking back at our lives since we came to London in 1996, we feel Sri Krishna is guiding us in our lives, giving us the opportunity to associate with devotees, to learn the essence of devotional service and to render selfless service. By being close to the Manor 10 minutes away by car, we feel privileged to be able to regularly visit the Manor for darshan, to attend courses by School of Bhakti and to render devotional service.\n\nAlthough we do not deserve the causeless mercy that has somehow been showered upon us, we remain sincerely grateful for this incredible mercy and the wonderful association of devotees that remains our mainstay and support. Our eternal gratitude to our Founder-Acarya who laid the foundation of the ISKCON movement and under whose umbrella we remain committed servants. It is through the mercy of Srila Prabhupada that we came to know of the life and teachings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the combined form Sri Sri Radha-Krishna.\n\nThe beautiful Holy month of Kartik has just ended during which we had the opportunity to render more service, chant and read more. This incomparable month is truly blissful and provides great impetus for us to be sincere in our devotional practices.\n\nIn line with your instructions, we are endeavouring to remain the servants of the servants of the servants, rendering service to one and all without any expectation of praise or reward.\n\nAs we are both over 70 years of age, we have naturally slowed down. Nevertheless, we remain determined to render service on a regular basis. We humbly beg you to bless us that we continue to serve the Vaisnavas with love and affection.\n\nWe both look forward to having your association next month at the Festival of Gratitude at Govardhan ECO Village on 7 December 2025.\n\nIn gratitude, we remain, your eternal servants,\nChandra Caitanya das\nPrema Vilasini devi dasi\nLondon UK"

        "country":  "India",
        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna,\n \n Guru Dev, for the last one year, our community of god brothers and god sisters residing here in Sri Vrindavan Dham, have been coming together every fortnight to relish “JOURNEY HOME” through your recorded recitation – a precious gift of yours to all of us. In these meetings, we try to hear one or two chapters and then, based on that, we share our reflections.\n \n I can confidently admit that it has been extremely nourishing association for each one of us. Hearing your inner thoughts in your own voice, with deep emotions from your heart, has gifted us your cherished divine Sanga and such connectivity that cannot be expressed in words.\n \n This has not only helped us to unite as a god family, but has also helped us to grow together in our understanding through your struggles, what it means to be a sincere, devoted, and surrendered disciple. Sure enough, I am far from being such a follower, but yes, Guru Maharaj, I am gradually realizing the significance of carrying the responsibility of being faithful to our Guru and to the entire parampara.\n \n By Sri Sri Gaur Nitai, Sri Sri Krishna Balaram, and Sri Sri Radha Shyamsundar’s blessings, I feel so fortunate to be amongst our Sanga group all your wonderful children in Sri Vrindavan Dham to celebrate your 75th divine appearance day.\n \n Guru Dev, your godly qualities are innumerable, and to choose and glorify any one is beyond my capacity. However, by regularly hearing from you, your amazing experiences about your inner journey has highlighted for me one specific trait of your divine personality.\n \n In your search for God, you met with many people with different behaviors and spiritual practices, from an ordinary person to highly elevated souls. And from every interaction, you tried to take only that which could help you in your longing to know God and love Him. Impressed by the purity of your desire, you attracted everyone’s heart, and you made many friends during your travels. So much so that even after accepting Srila Prabhupada your most beloved Guru Maharaj’s shelter, those acquaintances, from whom many had become your lifelong friends, they fondly look forward to being with you.\n \n “The deepest *vapu* is actually when we surrender to the *vani*. We can truly experience the presence of our beloved Gurus according to our willingness to surrender with love to please them.” These profound words from your opening lecture during the Govardhan Yatra this time say it all.\n \n While describing the episode about Vajranabha, the great grandson of Krishna trying to excavate Vrindavan’s lost holy places, you said, “Actually, when I read this story in *Gopal Champu*, I was remembering when Srila Prabhupada came to Butler, Pennsylvania, in New York City, and he was trying so hard to do the mission of his Guru Maharaj, but everything seemed to be failing, and it seemed to be hopeless, and it seemed so helpless.” I was wondering… such absorption where Guru and Krishna become inseparable.\n \n This amazing quality of yours has made me realize that the deeper we connect with God through our Guru’s *vani*, more and more we are freed from the externals and dualities of this world, and we are able to appreciate the essence in all without being entangled by the superficialities of the material world. With that maturity of fine balance, we can be of different sects, following a specific *sampradaya*, still, we can be welcoming and be sensitive towards other beliefs, and without being disloyal to our own Guru and Acharyas, we can offer our heartfelt respects to others.\n \n Guru Dev, I gain a lot of strength in my own spiritual practice from observing how you are always in the company of Srila Prabhupada’s *vani* – his every word, impressions, desires are your life and soul, what to speak of his instructions. The depth of your knowledge of his books is so thorough; you ponder on every word and scrutinizingly study each line, and very carefully, you take pains to train us in the same way.\n \n Srila Guru Dev, I humbly pray that instead of trying to imitate you and endanger my spiritual life, let me honestly follow in your footsteps, adhering to the teachings of our parampara, and become fixed up in the *siddhanta* of our philosophy, and not get carried away by the flowery words of the shallow world. And hopefully, one day I may also develop this maturity of seeing everything and everyone in connection with you and Krishna.\n \n On this most auspicious birthday day of yours, I humbly beg for your compassionate blessings upon myself and all of us as followers of Srila Prabhupada, that we remain fully loyal to him and to our parampara, and at the same time, do not judge or criticize others or even look down upon others, bringing pain to Srila Prabhupada and Krishna.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Chandrika Radha Devi dasi"

I know this day must be the greatest austerity for you, yet out of your endless compassion—simply to see us happy—you tolerate everything with such grace.\n \n There is so much I wish to say, but I will share only a few things from my heart. My greatest inspiration, Prabhupāda’s disciple HG Yamunā Devī Dāsī Mataji, wrote in her biography how lovingly you cared for your godsisters, especially Yamunā Mataji, during her times of need. She also shared how you supported Jahnavi Mataji Yamunā Mataji’s younger sister in her devotional journey.\n \n I have also heard from senior Vaiṣṇavas in many lectures that you are a person who does not seek attention, yet purely to serve Śrīla Prabhupāda you accepted the immense responsibility of the Bombay temple. I remember hearing how you promised the Punjabi officer who allowed you to enter Bhārat-bhūmi that one day you would do something good for the people of this country—and you fulfilled that promise by starting so many projects that help people embrace Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n \n I first heard you speak when you were glorifying Sindhutai, and I felt your compassion had no limits. In 2023, I had the fortune of having your darshan in Kolkata. On the first day, when you visited the Newtown temple, I was overjoyed, but somehow not fully satisfied because I only caught a glimpse of you.\n \n But the very next day, by the mercy of Nitāi-Gaurāṅga, I again received your darshan at Gītā Bhavan, BRC. And while you were leaving, you waved at me. I was so happy that I told the story to everyone like an excited little child.\n \n I think my words are becoming long now, Maharaj, so I will simply say: Happy, happy birthday. I am nobody, but I like to believe that Nitāi-Gaurāṅga loves me, and therefore I have received so much mercy through you. I pray for your good health so that you may see the Abhay Tirtha Project manifest as soon as possible.\n \n I love you, Maharaj.\n Hare Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Prabhupāda ki jai."

I still long for that loving glance, Maharaj, just like that young boy I was then. Even now, whenever I am in your presence, I wait for you to look in my direction — and in that moment, I feel the same joy and protection that a child feels in the shelter of his father.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for accepting me as your disciple and for giving me the priceless gift of Krishna’s love. I beg for your forgiveness for all the mistakes I have committed — mostly knowingly — and I sincerely pray at your lotus feet to help cleanse my heart and allow me to truly appreciate the gift that Srila Prabhupada has given us.\n\nOn this sacred day, my heartfelt prayers are offered to the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, Sri Nitai Gaurachandra, Sri Gopalji, and Srila Prabhupada to bless you with the best of health and strength, so that you may continue to inspire countless souls with your love, compassion, devotion, and unwavering focus on Krishna.\n\nI am too overwhelmed to express everything that I feel, but I simply want to thank you for being in my life and for accepting me as your servant.\n\nDandavats,\nYour eternal servant,\nDamodarkirti das"

I am remembering that old moment after Sunday feast class, senior devotees used to welcome and have personal talks and care for newcomers. A true Guru is one who is a perfect disciple. From \"Journey Home,\" we came to know that you have deep love for searching for the true meaning of life. After meeting so many Sadhus, finally, you surrendered to Srila Prabhupada, Founder Acharya of ISKCON, who spread the message of Lord Chaitanya all over the world. In Cross Maidan, amongst lakhs of crowded devotees, Srila Prabhupada called you and sat near you. Your every effort is always to try to please Srila Prabhupada\u0027s mission. Your contributions are like establishing Govardhan Eco Village, Replica of Vrindavan, Bhakti Vedanta Hospital which provides spiritual and physical healthcare, Vashana Eye Hospital for serving Vrajavasis, and so many others. A true leader is one who can prepare many leaders. Your senior disciples are versatile in nature and leading Srila Prabhupada\u0027s mission very nicely. Last year, for the pleasure of Srila GopalKrishna Goswami Maharaja, you empowered all of us to come first in the Book Marathon. Your humility is melting millions of hearts. Last year I saw during the Bhagavat Katha of HH Bhakti Rasamrita Swami Maharaja your disciple, you came, offered obeisances, sat on the floor, and heard. This year on the \"Guru Kripa Bindu\" YouTube channel, old glorifications of devotees are being broadcast. It is really nourishing both body, mind, and soul.

Sometimes we just chant fast so that we can complete some other pending works or chant some extra rounds, but when I heard you chanting, it was so, so soft, filled with love, devotion, and utterly calling out for Krsna.\n \n Srila Prabhupada mentioned that we should chant 16 good rounds, and that day, when I heard your chanting, I realized what is the meaning of chanting good rounds.\n \n In your lectures, you always speak about humility, and truly, you are the embodiment of the \"Trinad api suni cena\" verse.\n \n We usually think that for establishing relationships, we need to learn the regional language, but when I see the loving exchange between you and the Vrajavasis, that clearly shows that true relationship is established through love, and love is a matter of the heart, not language.\n \n At the age of 75 also, you are showering your causeless mercy upon all of us, and to see you sitting on the vyasasan and giving lectures for continuously 3-4 hours, and then kirtan during Kartik Yatra to Sri Govardhan Dham, is really extraordinary. We all can see how dear and blessed you are by Srila Prabhupada \u0026 Sri Sri Radha Gopinath.\n \n I am really blessed to have you in my life. Please accept this unworthy, lowly self at your lotus feet.\n Maharaj, I am extremely fallen and there is no hope for shelter without your causeless mercy.\n \n yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo\n yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto ‘pi\n \n All my doubts get cleared through your lectures, and I get extremely motivated for my spiritual life.\n \n I have written a small offering for you. I hope and sincerely pray at your lotus feet that you will accept this composition. 🙏🏻\n \n Srila Guru Maharaj era carane poriya\n Mangibo Harinama bhiksha.\n \n Srila Guru Maharaj era carana ashraya bina\n Ara kichu nahi tribhuvane mora.\n \n Srila Guru Maharaj ra kripa bina\n Ki bhave sevibo Sri Radha Krsna.\n \n Sri Chaitanya nera siksha \"Trinad api suni cena\"\n Sara jagate shikaile tumi diyeh nijera udharana.\n \n Srila Prabhupada era seva lagi\n Nijera sampurna jivana dile tumi.\n \n Prabhupada era icha New Vrindavana\n Nijera samasta diyeh korle Prabhupada era icha purna.\n \n Tomara marga darshana kripa bina\n Ki bhave keo mujhibe Sri Vrindavana.\n \n Ohh Guru Dev, tomara ahaituki kripa hee bharosa\n Echara mora ara nahi udhara.\n \n Daya karo, kripara sagara, e’i adham jivera prati\n Tumi nah kripa korle ki hobe mora gati.\n \n Mora ek matra abhilasha\n Tomara carane mora aasha.\n \n Thanking you,\n Your Eternal Servant,\n Dev Aditya"

All glories to His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada.\n \n On this very auspicious day of your appearance, we are feeling supremely grateful to be a part of your family. Our hearts are nourished by your gentle instructions, love, and affection for our whole family for the last 30+ years.\n \n Today, I am appreciating the wisdom that you have shared with all of us. It is all in the scriptures, but so often we miss it, even though we read and understand the story or pastimes. I am meditating on this wisdom from our scriptures that makes not only human relations palatable, but it makes us humans. It is this wisdom that gives birth to loving relationships, not only among devotees but among all relationships, rather among all interactions. It is this mood of love and care that you have poured into the hearts of your followers. In that encounter with the border security officer of Ferozepur, you made that commitment to Officer Sardar ji that \"I promise to do something good for the people of India... please give me a chance.\" Now I am wondering if Lord Krishna put those words in your vāṇī and He also empowered you to execute your promise through the blessings of Lord you received on your head from the hands of Sardar ji. This year, I witnessed for many days the results of your compassion in Kumbh Mela by seeing how millions of devotees benefited by honoring super fresh and hot prasadam by Mega Kitchen. This year, I also noticed how much love and affection Vraj Basis have for you because of your long, loving reciprocations with them via eye camps, dental camps, and now the most needed Barsana Hospital. This year, I also witnessed in GEV thousands of pilgrims, including highly cultured, wonderful, and professional school children, coming and breathing fresh air and allowing the divine mercy of Sri Madan-Mohan ji to enter the depths of their hearts. So, the promise, Gurudev, you have made to Sardar ji on the border of India has been fulfilled a long time ago. My family is also one of the recipients of the prasad you have mercifully distributed, not only to Indians but much beyond the borders of India. We are eternally indebted to you.\n \n We are praying to you on this auspicious day to bless us with the wisdom of your heart to serve your desire in service to your Gurudev, Srila Prabhupada. In our remaining years on this earth, we want to serve your desire with our minds, bodies, and souls.\n \n Hari Bol.\n \n Your servants,\n Devakinandan das \u0026 Gundica devi dasi"

Thank you, Maharaj, for saving me from the forest fire of material existence. I don\u0027t know how I would have survived without Krsna consciousness in this ruthless, cutthroat corporate world! Thank you for transforming my heart by your vani. Thank you for the holy names, and above all, thank you, Maharaj, for engaging me as an instrument in this sankirtan mission of Lord Caitanya. I am deeply indebted to you and every devotee in my life whom you have sent for rescuing me, tolerating, training, and empowering me. Thank you for Kartik Yatra 2k25 at Govardhan, where we get a rare opportunity after billions of lifetimes to be allowed entry into the confidential pastimes of this most auspicious place in the entire material and spiritual worlds.\n\nRecently, I was hearing some of your pastimes from our senior Godbrothers and I was spellbound by your constant remembrance of Krsna and His pastimes. I heard about the forest fire, treadmill, and aname pastimes from Dwarkadish Pr, where you are able to connect every situation to Krsna. I remembered the verse: yo mam pasyati sarvatra sarvam ca mai pasyati... and due to this, you are beyond the threefold miseries: iti nandayo gopa krsna rama katham mudah. I am always inspired by your deep humility, especially the pastime where you wrote \"das\" in a register where others mentioned their positions.\n\nLast year was wonderful. I was humbled by how you used us as instruments to bring so many more souls to the mission. I could clearly see the hands of Krsna and intelligence being supplied by the parampara to take right decisions, and many innovations and on-ground decisions in our outreach, and 8 boys have agreed to stay in VOICE. Please bless them that they become nice devotees taking responsibility in the mission of compassion. Please always keep me overly engaged, Maharaj, in this sankirtan mission so that Maya cannot give me any engagements. I am ready to burn my body, mind, and words in the fire of Sankirtana!\n\nMaharaj, I am really deeply struggling with envy, fault-finding, lethargy, wasting time, inattentive japa and sadhana, prajalpa, not applying myself in hearing and contemplating, and not giving my best in my practice. I sincerely beg blessings from you, Maharaj, so that I can become strong and determined in my surrender to Krsna so that I can increase my service and please Guru and Gauranga.\n\nI seek your empowerment, Maharaj, so that we can bring out a wonderful batch of students at IIT Hyderabad by glorifying Krsna sincerely and inspiring them to undergo VOICE training. But in the face of unforeseen challenges, I feel helpless, and I pray to you for the right intelligence and sufficient spiritual strength so that we can do the impossible to please you and all our superiors!\n\nThank you,\nYour servant,\ndevansh"

When you were a child, you were very compassionate toward the poor \u0026 needy. You always preferred to sit on the ground for taking meals, just like Indians usually do. That shows there was a deep connection between you \u0026 Indian culture.

I remember the incident from your book, *Journey Home*, that how one official from India obstructed you \u0026 how, in response, you told him that one day you would certainly do some good for this country \u0026 its people. And the whole world is now witnessing the results. You did what you had promised.

You live the life according to the verses of *Sikshastakam*: \"trinadapi sunichen taror iva sahisnunam.\"\n \n We are very grateful to you, Maharaj, for the wonderful yatras, through which you give us your association every year. Your Kartik Yatras are ecstatic \u0026 your lectures are completely filled with love for Radha Krishna. Thank you very much, Maharaj, for initiating my bhakti and giving me the only shelter of your lotus feet. I\u0027m eternally indebted to you, Dearest Guru Maharaj.\n Today, on this Vyasapuja day, I pray to the Lord \u0026 devotees to bless me \u0026 my family with the strength to serve you \u0026 follow your instructions wholeheartedly with determination in order to please you, Srila Prabhupada \u0026 the Guru parampara.\n Yours insignificant servant,\n Dhanurdhar Pran Das, Shraddha, Gaurang"

From my earliest childhood, before I could even understand the true meaning of “Guru,” your presence had already touched and shaped my life. You were, and continue to be, a gentle, guiding light—soft yet powerful, silent yet transformative. I am deeply grateful to you for accepting me as your disciple and for giving me the opportunity to serve in the mission of Srila Prabhupada.\n \n I would like to share a few memories that remain forever engraved in my life.\n \n My birthday always comes during the auspicious month of Kartik, and every year, by your mercy, I would be in the Kartik Yatra. When I was small, I would prepare a little birthday speech, rehearse it the whole day, and eagerly wait for the moment I could come to you and say, “Guru Maharaj, today is my birthday, please bless me.” I vividly remember one particular birthday year—we were standing under a Neem tree in Mayapur, and you lovingly handed me a single neem leaf. That remains the sweetest gift I have ever received. Whether it was your gentle knocks on my head, your autographs on my forehead, your affectionate smile, or even a brief glance—each smallest gesture from you filled my heart with immeasurable joy. It still does.\n \n Even today, on my birthdays, I seek your blessings—and I pray to always do so throughout my life.\n \n But the most unforgettable moment of my life was my initiation. Not merely because I received my spiritual name, but because you gave me and my sister, Vishakha Priti Devi Dasi, a silent yet profound instruction. Through your actions, without speaking a word, you taught us to always remain grateful to our parents Ramswarup Das and Gaur Bhakti Devi Dasi—who brought us into Krishna consciousness. That unspoken lesson will guide me throughout this lifetime and beyond.\n \n I offer my heartfelt gratitude to you, Guru Maharaj:\n \n For giving us Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, under whose shelter I grew up and in whose association the seed of bhakti was first planted in my heart.\n \n For giving us Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Bihari, blessing us with the fortune of living in the Dham and deepening the purity of our devotion.\n \n For giving us Sri Sri Radha Gokul Bihari in Palghar, where I experienced the joy of serving Their Lordships with all my heart.\n \n Guru Maharaj, I pray for your mercy so that I may serve you and contribute to Srila Prabhupada’s mission to the best of my capacity—until my last breath.\n Thank you very much Radhanath Maharaj, for being an eternal ray of light in moments of darkness, and for always directing us toward the ultimate goal—Back Home, Back to Godhead.\n \n On this glorious 75th Appearance Day, I offer my heartfelt gratitude, my prayers, and my attempt at service at your lotus feet.\n HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki Jay!\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Dhanya Gopi Devi Dasi"

When we read The Journey Home, we were amazed at the fact of how you remembered every single event to its minute details. Your quality of observing and processing the events that unfolded in your life teaches us how you are present and absorbed in every moment.\n2. The instructions which you share through your nectarean lectures with your disciples and ever-growing Radhagopinath congregation are very inspiring. Every instruction of yours reflects the need to cultivate sincere gratitude towards our parampara and develop a humble service attitude towards our fellow godbrothers and godsisters. These instructions are helping both of us in our journey of practicing Krsna consciousness, reminding us at every step of the mood which you desire to cultivate.\n3. Your presence of mind and humor in dealings with others is quite amazing and inspiring. In one of the videos shared by HG Arjun Sakha Prabhu, he narrates that once an Indian chess player asked you, \"How did you get attracted to our Krsna?\" And knowing his chess background, you replied, \"This white boy got checkmated by your black king of Vraja.\" Because he was a chess player, you gave a reply in chess language. This interaction highlighted your humorous nature and ability to come up with witty Krsna conscious answers on the spot.\nFinally, we thank you from the bottom of our heart for accepting us as your disciples and we request you to bless us that we may continue to serve in this mission of Srila Prabhupada till the last day of our life.\n\nYour humble servants,\nDharmaraj das and Sukumari Radhe Devi Dasi"

Because of him, we have received such a compassionate and exalted spiritual master like you.\n \n Guru Mahārāj, you often say that when a person works without any expectation of name and fame, that person becomes truly powerful. Whenever I see you, I remember this teaching, because you embody it completely.\n \n I feel extremely fortunate that from my engineering college days I received the association of ISKCON Chowpatty. I first saw the beautiful forms of Śrī Śrī Rādhā Gopinath in a photograph in 2016, and after six long years, I was blessed to see Them personally for the first time during your Śrīmad Bhāgavatam class at Chowpatty in 2022. That moment changed my life.\n \n Guru Mahārāj, you once shared a profound teaching from Śrīla Prabhupāda. When he was travelling on a road under construction, he saw a sign:\n “Temporary inconvenience for permanent convenience.”\n You beautifully explained how this applies perfectly to spiritual life—how the temporary inconvenience of waking up early, chanting attentively, and following discipline ultimately leads us to our eternal spiritual progress and permanent position at Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet. These words remain etched in my heart.\n \n Just by your glance, one’s heart transforms. Your smile melts the pride of conditioned souls and awakens devotion within them.\n \n Since 2022, I have been attending the Kartik Yatra, and every year your narrations of the Lord’s divine līlās make my chanting taste like sweet butter. Your voice in kīrtan feels as if it descends from the spiritual world itself—touching the soul and awakening it from the deep entanglement of material life.\n \n Guru Mahārāj, even amidst your physical discomfort and difficult health, you continue to give us your association and teach us how to live the essence of tṛṇād api sunīcena—to be humbler than a blade of grass—and taror iva sahiṣṇunā—to be as tolerant as a tree. Your life is a living commentary on these verses.\n \n You have given us many priceless gems, and especially servants like HG Gauranga Prabhu and HG Radheyshyam Prabhu, who are taking care of ISKCON with such dedication and depth. Their leadership reflects your true servant-leader mood—where a real leader creates more leaders and remains a humble servant.\n \n Thank you so much, Mahārāj, for your constant compassion, guidance, and shelter. I am earnestly aspiring to take initiation from you. I am sincerely trying to follow the four regulative principles and chant 16 rounds daily.\n \n Please bless me that I may become a fit servant of your lotus feet.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Dheeraj Vibhute"

Countless times you have showered your mercy upon us, even when we are completely undeserving. Out of your causeless compassion, you notice this insignificant soul, uplift it from the depths of maya, and guide it gently but firmly towards the ultimate destination, back home, back to Godhead.\n \n I often think of the precious moments when we were blessed with your association in GEV. When we were near Yamuna, you turned and smiled at us… such a simple gesture, yet it carried so much affection and reassurance. Then, when you were during your walk, you came to Radha Shyamsundar temple, spoke to us with such kindness and compassion, and during prasadam, you even asked me, “I hope you are enjoying the prasadam…”\n \n When I recollect these memories, I realize how deeply our thoughts become connected to you. You understand even our smallest, simplest thoughts and effortlessly redirect them towards Krishna. Your presence transforms everything: our consciousness, our desires, even the way we see the world.\n \n Maharaj, your mercy is like a constant shelter. Even when we falter, even when our minds wander, you gently bring us back, reminding us of what truly matters.

Even when you were feeling uncomfortable, still you agreed to let him make you wear it because of your love for him and his service that he rendered. You never think about your convenience but are always willing to do whatever is possible for the welfare of others.\n \n Behind this whole effort and the sole inspiration, you are the main person, but still, you gave all the credit to other devotees with so much love and mercy.\n \n This quality of sacrificing for others, appreciating others for their every small or big service, inspires me to develop a drop of such quality like you, to make every devotee feel special for each and every service that they render.\n \n It was your desire that there should be preaching in IITB, and by the mercy of superiors and their guidance, I am trying to do something which I hope is pleasing to you.

While you were walking to deliver the evening lecture in the Pandal, on the way, in the crowd, I took the opportunity and tried to enter in front of him. I fell down for dandavat pranam by observing and taking a chance to put my head on your lotus feet for about 10 seconds when you were talking to other devotees. After standing up, you looked up at me and gave a pleasant smile. I also reciprocated and thanked you.

As soon as you saw me, you came forward happily and embraced me very firmly, smiled, and gave blessings. I told you that I came from ISKCON NVCC, Pune, to offer my dedicated services, seva, at the temple for about 6 months, as I came on a Business visa to the USA. You happily welcomed, said it was good, and blessed me to do better devotional services. I felt very happy. Later, I handed over to you 7 cups of burfi prasadam, which I brought from NVCC, Pune.\n \n Maharaj, you came in my dream 5 times and blessed me.\n \n In the first dream, on Monday, 18th March 2019 night, you gave diksha, initiation, to all 4 of my family members: myself, wife Sunita, son Prashant now Pandurang Sharan Das, Brahmachari at NVCC, Pune, and daughter Kritika, and blessed all of us.\n \n In the second dream, on Wednesday, 23rd November 2022, is your 72nd Vyas Puja celebration at NVCC, Pune.

I felt myself very lucky and blessed with your pure divine power and Krishna blessing me by making you a means and medium.\n \n In the third dream, in the year 2023, I was attending your lecture, participating in kirtan, and during this, I came to you to do dandavat pranam, which I did, and you blessed me.\n \n On the fourth occasion, on Friday, 6th September 2024 night, I had a dream of myself present at ISKCON Chowpatty, Mumbai, and observing you giving initiations, dikshas, to several devotees there. I saw you from a very close distance. I discussed with a few initiated devotees; saffron brahmacharis took delicious feast prasadam there. For reference, currently, the initiation program is going on at ISKCON Chowpatty.\n \n On the fifth occasion, on Wednesday, 9th April 2025 Dwadashi night, early morning at about 3:30 am of Thursday, 10th April 2025, I had a dream of seeing you directly on a dias and attending your Kartik Yatra lecture on Govardhan Leela of Shri Krishna at Vrindavan for about 2 hours, sitting myself in the front row, along with thousands of devotees in the pandal. I could see the actual Govardhan Hill behind the pandal. I was given a task of video recording of the lecture for circulation to all by the yatra committee, which I did. This can be correlated to the forthcoming Kartik Yatra 2025 in October 2025 at Vraj, Govardhan Hill, Vrindavan. I feel happy and blessed by all. I could not attend the physical yatra in October 2025 as I am doing seva at ISKCON Boston, USA, from 5th September 2025 to 10th February 2026, for a period of about 6 months, having come on a Business Visa.\n \n I have been chanting 16 rounds from 2007, reading Bhagavad Gita daily, one chapter, shlokas, translation, completed Srimad Bhagavatam reading, Adi and Madhya Lila of Chaitanya Charitamrita, following regulative principles, attending classes, programs, coordinating Deity backup, and clothes pressing sevas at NVCC. I have donated over 1000 Bhagavad Gitas and over 15 Srimad Bhagavatam sets, and I am seriously aspiring for diksha, initiation, from you. My name was finalized, and I was in the final list for the initiation function held at GEV, Wada, on 27th-28th December 2024, which I missed and am waiting for the next immediate opportunity to become your Das, servant, and offer dedicated services to please you, Prabhupad, Radha, and Krishna.\n \n I appreciate your very sincere, hard-working, painstaking efforts, humble nature, servant of servant attitude, humility, compassion, love, and care to all devotees and jivas, in-depth study and presentation, preaching, spreading Krishna Consciousness throughout the world to please Prabhupad, Lord Radha, Krishna, and devotees. I wish to become a very, very minor, insignificant part of your worldwide movement, mission, activities, and please in all respects with my utmost highest capacity, efforts, and capability. I request you to accept me as your servant, provide me an opportunity to fulfill your desire, and progress on the devotional path.\n \n I wish and pray to Radha and Krishna to provide you further best health, knowledge, intelligence, wisdom, strength, energy, outstanding efforts, and His choicest blessings to carry out the mission of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in spreading the glories of the Lord throughout the world and make everyone Krishna Conscious, helping them to go back, back to Godhead.\n \n Happy birth/appearance day, and I wish many more such days to continue to serve the mission of ISKCON.\n \n Thanks and Regards,\n \n Sincerely yours,\n Aspiring Servant,\n Dilipkumar Gunjegaonkar.\n \n Base, ISKCON, NVCC, Pune, India.\n Cell no. +919881248619\n Current Base at ISKCON, Boston, USA, cell no. +16173721421\n E-mail: dsgunjegaonkar@yahoo.co.in, dsgunjegaonkar@gmail.com"

All glories to you, who have filled my life with light, meaning, and devotion. All glories to our eternal master, Srila Prabhupada, through whom your divine mercy flows endlessly to the whole world.\n\nOn this sacred and most blessed day of your divine appearance, my heart trembles with gratitude. Words feel so small before your greatness, Gurudev. How can I ever describe the depth of your mercy, the ocean of your love, and the warmth of your compassion that has touched my life so deeply?\n\nYou left behind everything that the world calls precious — comfort, luxury, and security — and set out alone, guided only by faith and longing for Krishna. Through endless journeys, hunger, storms, and sleepless nights, you never stopped searching — not for wealth or fame, but for truth… for Krishna. That divine search became a message for us all — that when one walks with faith, the impossible becomes the path to the Lord’s heart.\n\nThroughout your sacred journey, you met souls of every kind — saints, seekers, and mystics — and to each you offered respect, never judgment. You saw Krishna in every face, in every soul. Your humility is so deep that even those who tried to test you became transformed by your grace.\n\nAnd then, when you finally met Srila Prabhupada, your heart recognized your eternal Guru. That moment became the turning point not only of your life but of countless lives like mine. Since that day, you have walked this world as his pure representative — embodying love, humility, and devotion that words can never capture.\n\nGurudev, you are a living temple of compassion. Your smile carries the warmth of Krishna’s mercy; your tears in kirtan melt even the hardest hearts. When you raise your hands and call out the holy names, it feels as though the entire universe pauses to listen. Your joy is contagious, your humility disarming, your presence divine.\n\nEvery time I see you, I feel that Krishna Himself is reminding me — “See? This is what love looks like.”\n\nAnd Gurudev… I must confess something with a smile 😃 — I took a little help from ChatGPT while writing this, because my English is not so good, and I didn’t want my limited words to limit my heart. But every word, every feeling, every tear behind these lines is truly mine — born from the gratitude I hold for you deep within my heart.\n\nOn this holy day, I have only this small prayer:\nPlease bless me that I may love and serve you with sincerity.\nPlease bless me that I may never forget your kindness.\nPlease bless me that I may chant the holy names with the same faith you have taught us, and remain forever at your lotus feet — until my last breath.\n\nYour mercy is my only hope.\nYour love is my only strength.\nYour lotus feet are my only home.\n\nYour unworthy servant,\nDilkhush Parmar"

        "country":  "India",
        "Your Offering ":  "Dearest Gurudeva,\n \n On the most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, I take a few moments to appreciate your profound, glorious, transcendental, divine and yet deceivingly human-like qualities that take the form of an acronym RADHA:\n \n R – Relentless Consistency\n A – Anchored yet Adaptable\n D – Diligent Hearing\n H – Helpless Dependence, Thoughtful Action\n A – Absorption in what Truly Matters\n \n 1 Relentless Consistency:\n This time in the Kartik Yatra 2025 at Govardhan, a senior counselor from Radha Gopinath temple asked me, \"Do you know what\u0027s the evidence that Maharaja wants us to attend the Kartik yatra? The proof is in the action, the hard efforts which Maharaja puts in at the age of 75 to come and speak for 3 hours everyday, lead an energetic blissful kirtan for another hour and informally speak to devotees for another hour.\" It struck me and when I contemplated this line of thought, I couldn\u0027t agree more. Gurudev, we see how you prepare meticulous notes for your evening kathas and ensure your presence in the pandal despite poor health, sometimes even when you\u0027re on the verge of collapsing due to bodily sickness. The depth of your chanting is clearly visible and audible during the kirtans, especially when you stop in between and request us to cry out with all sincerity from the core of our hearts, one million, billion and trillion times louder. You especially emphasize auspicious days such as Srila Prabhupada\u0027s disappearance day when you personally come and sing the prayer for departed Vaisnavas Je anilo prema dhana with utmost intensity, gravity and prayerfulness. If this is not evidence that demands our reciprocation, what else is? All that we need to do is to be conscious attendees, striving to hear, contemplate and absorb every word and action that is demonstrated by you. But sometimes we fail to fulfill even this simple expectation. We must not think that we can skip the Kartik yatras because it\u0027s getting too congested with so many attendees or because we\u0027ve now been around for several decades! Your consistency in every aspect of devotional service is simply mind-blowing and an outstanding example for us to emulate. Particularly your consistency in yourself leading Kartik yatras since 1986 seeing it grow from 12 to 12,000 attendees in 40 years is inspirational, given that you could easily choose to retire from the grueling yatra schedules, asking your competent senior disciples to lead instead. But you personally lead us even now because you care for us, our spiritual nourishment, upliftment and togetherness as a community united for a common cause. If there is one takeaway for me this Kartik yatra, it is, \"Never miss a Kartik Yatra as long as the legacy continues!\"\n \n 2 Anchored yet Adaptable: Recently I have been contemplating another beautiful quality that you exhibit and which was glorified by an esteemed godbrother of yours. He said, \"Radhanath Swami is the most uncompromising yet completely open-minded person I have ever seen!\" This one sentence captures how you have expertly balanced fidelity to the parampara and flexibility in contemporary outreach, evident in your talks and dealings both on and off the vyasasana. In one of the evening talks in the Kartik yatra this year, you mentioned that we must be very careful to be kind and accommodating to each other and at the same time keep the ideal of pure devotional service intact. You said that most of us, being conditioned souls, are so far from that ideal that if we are not careful to keep track, we may end up never achieving that lofty goal of Krishna Prema. Generally, we tend to gravitate to extremes of compromise or rigidity and thus end up falling prey to criticism or envy. Through your example and words, though, we learn the art of fine balancing that is the very defining thread of Bhakti.\n \n 3 Diligent Hearing: Another quality I\u0027m trying to imbibe is to develop deep appreciation for your classes and instructions which can easily be missed if one is not attentive. For example, in your recent Kartik Yatra class this year, you mentioned that Madhavendra Puri, despite being embarrassed about Krishna personally coming to serve him with a pot of milk, did not allow that shame to become an obstacle in his service of excavating Gopal deity and installing him on Govardhan. This is a subtle but very critical point that shows us how devotional service is not about us our bad or good times but about pleasing the Lord and His devotees, a totally different realm and paradigm, far removed from this material world. Your diligence in hearing Srila Prabhupada\u0027s classes is evident as you so often quote from them in your classes, remembering the exact year, location, and theme of the class.\n In this connection, I recall a beautiful contemplation by HG Vrajabihari pr, which I paraphrase here: \"Radhanath Swami has two aspects: a social Radhanath Swami and a spiritual Radhanath Swami. While the social Radhanath Swami blesses couples, gives names to babies, smiles lovingly at devotees and cares for their all-round holistic well-being, the spiritual Radhanath Swami pours out his heart, life, and blood into his classes, kirtans, and instructions for our spiritual progress, which he hopes we will deeply imbibe. Radhanath Swami, being a pure representative of the parampara, has not come to make our material lives better but rather to give us the greatest treasure, nothing less than pure devotional service.\" Generally, we look forward to and relish, cherish, and reminisce about the interactions of the social Radhanath Swami, but often fail to take your classes and kirtans seriously. We must strive to go beyond a superficial perspective and take deep shelter of your vani, which is kindly made available by RG Media in so many forms. You once said to a Belgaum mataji who had lovingly prepared Khichdi for you but you had to leave for the airport, \"You are feeling bad that I\u0027m not eating your Khichdi, but I\u0027m feeling sad that my disciples don\u0027t hear my talks, which I have cooked with so much love and concern!\" This is my prayer to you, Gurudev, that I can move forward from being a superficial to a substantial sadhaka and take advantage of the \"personal instructions\" in your love-cooked classes and kirtans.\n \n 4 Helpless dependence, thoughtful independence: Another nuanced quality you exhibit, Gurudev, is treading the fine balance between helpless dependence and thoughtful independence in Krishna Consciousness. This means that we must practice deriving strength and nourishment in the association of devotees while simultaneously preparing to stand on our own feet based on the nourishment received in Satsanga without always depending on the physical association of devotees for every small detail. We see examples from your life in the Journey Home book, one of which happened at Mashed, Iran. Here you expressed a desire for solitude to Jeff and Ramsey and sat alone reading from the Quran in front of the holy mosque. From this, I gather that we must not fall prey to laziness and complacency in the name of dependence on Satsanga. In our own lives, by the force of circumstances beyond our control, we may be located in remote corners of the world without devotees, or in places where the existing ISKCON setup is plagued with infighting, power politics, and weak leadership. In these situations, instead of backing down and staying aloof, we must stand strong, preach, safeguard ourselves while respectfully cooperating with the local authorities to the best extent possible. This does not in any way undermine the importance of Satsanga but strives to remind us that there are times when we will be alone and we must be prepared for it. In fact, the time of death with the Paramatma accompanying us is largely a lonely journey, and we must prepare for it while we\u0027re alive and healthy. As Srila Prabhupada beautifully summarizes in the purport to SB 1.15.50, \"When flying an airplane, one cannot take care of other planes. Everyone has to take care of his own plane, and if there is any danger, no other plane can help another in that condition. Similarly, at the end of life, when one has to go back home, back to Godhead, everyone has to take care of himself without help rendered by another. The help is, however, offered on the ground before flying in space. Similarly, the spiritual master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband, and others can all render help during one’s lifetime, but while crossing the sea one has to take care of himself and utilize the instructions formerly received.\" As we spend years in the movement, we must learn to spend time absorbed in the Holy Name and sharavanam to develop our unique personal individual relationship with you and our \"private Paramatma,\" as you beautifully put it in one of your classes.\n \n 5 Absorption in what truly matters: Gurudev, on your 75th birthday, when senior counselors asked you what gift they can offer, you mentioned 5 things that will please you:\n 1. Go deep into hearing, chanting, and service.\n 2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Krishna.\n 3. Strive to be united as a community.\n 4. Practice enthusiasm to share Krishna Consciousness.\n 5. Never forget that Bhakti is not about quantity but about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n \n And you added, \"This is the answer I will give whether it is the 25th, 50th, or 75th birthday. Never compromise quality for quantity and infuse quality into quantity.\" What a gift, Gurudev! It is easy to say \"Radhanath Swami Ki Jai,\" but not as easy to be a devotee of substance rooted in hearing and chanting. I pray for the strength to follow these five instructions and particularly the first one of going deep into hearing, chanting, and service, which is the only means to stay connected with you on the spiritual platform perpetually in favorable or adverse circumstances and thus to the entire Gaudiya Vaishnava Guru Parampara, which you represent.\n }}\n Your Servant,\n Dinabandhu Caitanya Das"

You guide us to serve them with humility and purity.\n \n Due to my sinful condition, I haven\u0027t met you or seen you in person. I do, however, take this as a sign that Lord Krishna is giving me time to prepare myself to get your association. I\u0027ve heard from devotees that the Lord gives separation, which in turn increases love towards Him. The same follows for His beloved devotees, such as you. You are truly a gem given to us by Srila Prabhupada and Lord Chaitanya.\n \n I would like to tell you that I\u0027ve been taking guidance from a few of your disciples for some time. As a result, I\u0027ve started to aspire to be your disciple just because of the pure devotee association of your sincere disciples. Your disciple, HG Sharanya Radha Devi Dasi, is an exceptional devotee. Talking to her really eases the doubts in one\u0027s heart; she wonderfully radiates your warmth and divinity. Your disciples really love you with all their hearts, and they always talk about you with so much adoration and gratitude. This wonderful bhāv of theirs really inspired me. I promise to sincerely take their guidance and become capable to serve you.\n \n I would also like to tell you that I\u0027ve been reading your autobiography, \"The Journey Home,\" which describes your transcendental life adventures in your own divine words. Reading the first few chapters has made me realize that Lord Krishna has really been biased about loving you. The strange and mysterious ways that He brought you to Srila Prabhupada after such a long journey throughout so many countries are truly wonderful! My parents have also been awestruck with your pastimes; it\u0027s really so wonderful that you decided to share these glorious pastimes to the world through your book.\n \n I would also like to pay my obeisances to the times when you read Srila Prabhupada\u0027s purports in your lectures. The way you say his divine name with so much affection and care is very, very heartwarming. It makes us, the listeners, relish Srila Prabhupada\u0027s, as well as your, words. Thank you for always showing us such a beautiful bhāv towards your Gurudev, Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedant Swami Srila Prabhupada.\n \n I deeply apologize, Maharaj. I am very ignorant, and I do not know much about your greatness. I\u0027m barely able to glorify you due to me being so fallen. Please have mercy on me, and I sincerely pray to my home Deities, to Srila Prabhupada, and to Sri Sri Rādhā Gopīnāth that this letter makes you smile. I sincerely hope so.\n \n Please be merciful towards me; please forgive the mistakes that I have committed while writing this letter, may it be words or in thoughts.\n \n Once again, I wish you a very wonderful Vyas Puja this year and for the upcoming many years.\n \n I again beg you to accept my humblest obeisances.\n \n Your Fallen Servant,\n Divya Patil\n Damodardesh, Dubai, UAE."

You have been the living embodiment of compassion, humility, and unwavering devotion to Śrī Śrī Radha-Gopinath. Through your words and actions, you have shown us how to transform our lives from selfishness to selflessness, from fear to faith, and from darkness to light.\n \n Your tireless service—whether in guiding devotees, uplifting communities, or nurturing the spirit of bhakti across the world—reminds us of Śrīla Vyāsadeva’s mission: to illuminate the path of truth for all souls. You have carried forward that mission with unmatched sincerity and love.\n \n For me personally, your presence is a beacon. You teach us that true leadership is not in authority but in service, not in recognition but in sacrifice. You have given meaning to our lives by connecting us to the eternal shelter of the Lord.\n \n On this day, I pray for the strength to serve in a way that pleases you, to imbibe even a fraction of your qualities, and to remain forever under your merciful guidance. May your health, strength, and divine inspiration continue to bless countless souls.\n \n Your servant, with gratitude and reverence.\n Divya Swarup Das"

Please accept my humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet. My dear Guru Maharaj, for me, taking your association during Chowpatty temple Sunday feast lecture, taking your darshans, offering you obeisances, and hearing Krishna Katha from your lotus mukhkamal is the one and only source of relief to my heart which is burning and distressed by the challenges of this material world.

Your kindness is visible in my other god brothers and sisters, and I am also putting my efforts to be kind like them and practice as they are practicing to please you, Guru Maharaj.\nI am not even qualified to talk with you in person. I just wonder, will I ever be able to become qualified to even utter two words with Your Holiness?\n\nBy your own life and example, Your Holiness has shown us what it truly means to follow and surrender to one’s spiritual master and to serve the sacred mission of Srila Prabhupada. Seeing your dedication gives hope to a fallen person like me, who otherwise has no strength of her own. I am deeply grateful for the shelter you have given me. By your mercy alone, I have the courage to continue and to keep trying, in whatever way I can, to serve the Vaishnavas and contribute to the mission.\n\nI beg your forgiveness and mercy, Guru Maharaj, for all those wrongdoings that I may have done due to my immaturity and disqualifications. I pray for the strength to remain faithful and to serve with sincerity. You are my everything, and I am completely yours.\n\nYours insignificant servant,\nDivyakriti Radha devi dasi."

I beg you to accept me as your property eternally and engage me as you wish.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, as an aspiring disciple, Your ideals and principles like humility and Vaishnava seva are fit for a perfect devotee, and I see that I am light years away from your expectations.

If not, then at least trying to be neutral in such situations is very important. In the yatra, I remember during the Govardhan Annakut festival, when devotees were preparing bhog for the Lord, and it was so, so smoky everywhere, but still, Maharaj came towards each and every devotee. It was such a sweet gesture, and I felt so blessed and fortunate that we are under the guidance of such a great soul who has so much compassion for everyone.

Our spiritual life has taken new turns after you have accepted us as your disciple.\n After 2020, I moved to my native place: Nangal in Punjab. It is a small town and there are no ISKCON centers. We were missing devotees and ISKCON programs badly. At times, we used to plan to shift back to Pune/Mumbai. However, after initiation, some miracles happened. A brahmacari started visiting a college nearby for preaching. It was a matter of great joy for us. And to add to our amazement, two devotee couples got posted in Nangal. This is nothing short of a miracle and it happened out of nowhere. Considering the limited job opportunities in Nangal, it is very rare that some devotees from Gurugram and other big cities get posted here. But by your and Krishna’s divine intervention; it happened. We felt as if you are arranging this for us, so that we feel sheltered and connected. Thanks Guru Maharaja.\n We have now started a weekly house program at our place. We conducted a Vedic summer camp for kids in our society which was attended with great joy by 42 kids; and parents appreciated it.\n For the first time in our town, we celebrated Radhashtami. It became a grand event with around 700 people coming. All these miracles are happening because of your blessings and mercy. Thanks for taking care of us.\n \n Please bless us so that we can serve in the mission of Srila Prabhupada in the mood of servant of the servant without any ulterior motive. May we be able to please your kind self, Srila Prabhupada, Lord Krishna, and devotees. May we serve only to please “You and Krishna”. May that be the only goal of our life.\n \n Thanks for your nice lectures. I derive great inspiration from your deep lectures. Your thoughts, words, and actions are deeply inspiring and resonate so well with us. Thanks for your association in yatras and the ecstatic kirtans.\n \n Thanks for the immeasurable contribution to the mission of Srila Prabhupada. It is deeply inspiring.\n \n May I become a good disciple of yours, and it is my humble aspiration to contribute to the various projects which you have undertaken.\n \n Last but not the least: I request you to please take very good care of yourself.\n Wishing you great health and happiness on your vyasapuja.\n Your disciple,\n \n Gaur Vallabha das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n I have long desired to be in your association since the time when the Vaisnava community was celebrating your 50th anniversary. I always carried this aspiration within my heart, and even while being physically distant and unable to offer you my prostrated obeisances, I prayed for the mercy of Srila Prabhupada, through which I hoped to attain devotional service under your guidance and thus become qualified to be a servant of the servants of the servants of His Divine Grace.\n \n You teach us to live each stage revealed in the Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam, transforming the feeling of separation from Śrī Vṛndāvana into an opportunity to manifest the Lord’s abode thousands of miles away from Vraja-bhūmi. In this way, the forests of Vrindavan conceived on the banks of the Vaitarna River are compared to the fully matured fruit of your intense meditation. Accompanied by the loving service of thousands of devotees of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Madana-Mohana, this meditation reveals to people in general how you teach us to relish the highest stages of Kṛṣṇa-bhakti: “adarśanam marma-hataṁ karotu vā.”\n \n Upon returning to the United States, when you began to reside within the Vṛndāvana manifested in the heart of Srila Prabhupada, your beloved spiritual master taught you the art of serving in separation, transforming the hills of Marshall County into the sacred dhāma where the prema-bhaktas gather. By establishing Vṛndāvana near the Ohio River, His Divine Grace taught us to understand that Śrī Śrī Rādhā–Vṛndāvana-candra are the Supreme manifestation who allow sincere devotees, even in this very lifetime, to enter into relationship with the eternal associates of the Divine Couple. For this reason, in his commentary on Akṣepa Regret by Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, Srila Prabhupada emphasizes: “Krishna means Krishna with His devotees. Krishna is never alone ... Krishna Consciousness means to keep association with the devotees of Krishna.”\n \n To keep this reality alive in your heart, you carry with you—like a garland—the third verse of the Śikṣāṣṭakam, teaching us the art of preserving taste and steadiness in the chanting of the Holy Names. You respect everyone and demand no respect for yourself, allowing your fully matured tree of bhaktir-ahaitukī to bear fruits that sow love for the Divine Couple in the hearts of innumerable devotees. Inspired by your example, hundreds of thousands of beads forming the garlands of the Saṅkīrtana Movement have been distributed throughout the world. Through these sacred beads, the devotees teach us that humility and tolerance are the true wealth required to attain the sublime position of servant of the servant of the servant of Śrī Śrī Rādhā–Gopīnātha.\n \n With the garland around our necks, you teach us to plunge into the waters of the ocean of bhakti-rasa. Separated from you by the ocean of material existence, I lament the lack of association with the devotees who serve you for the highest welfare of humanity. These devotees are my greatest inspiration in the service of Śrī Śrī Guru and Gaurāṅga. Keeping them in my mind, I hope that one day I may overcome the lack of courage that prevents me from attaining the association of those souls who, under your guidance, learn to discover and preserve the true treasure of human existence.\n \n When will the day come when I may awaken to my original state of divine consciousness and thus become an instrument in your hands? When that day arrives, I will have secured my place as the servant of the servants of the servants of the Guru-paramparā of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Gaura Chandra das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\n\nOn your very auspicious 75th appearance day, I would like to highlight one of the prominent qualities you have exhibited in your spiritually absorbed journey in this world.\n\nYou have many times in your lectures shared that the root of all virtues and good qualities lies in one quality which is gratitude. We have seen that you have spent your entire life expressing gratitude to everyone you came across. You have always remembered and highlighted the good qualities that your mother taught you in your early days. Once when you presented a beautiful rose to your mother on her birthday, which was grown and nourished by your mother herself, you shared the beautiful lesson that your mother taught you – it’s not the gift that matters, it’s the thought that matters – the thought of expressing gratitude.\n\nIn one of the vyaspuja ceremonies held in Mumbai in 2008, from deep within your heart you expressed gratitude to your father, recollecting his words he told you when you were in your teens – \"I am with you my son in whatever you do. I will never leave you.\" You mentioned how you tested this promise of your father beyond his imagination and how the promise given by your father never wavered.\n\nThe gratitude that you have for Srila Prabhupada in your heart is oceanic. In all your classes you mention your gratitude towards Srila Prabhupada. In fact, it is impossible to find or hear such a class wherein you don’t express your deep gratitude to Srila Prabhupada. The first session in all Kartik yatras held so far, you glorify Srila Prabhupada by discussing the struggles he went through in giving us this rare gift of KC. In one of your Vyas Puja offerings in 2021 during covid times, you gave a beautiful definition to the word \"Founder Acharya\" – you said:\nFounder Acharya is the acharya who found you and your Godbrothers/Sisters and all the devotees is the Founder Acharya. It is indeed our great fortune that we were found by Srila Prabhupada through you Guru Maharaj.\nGurudev, your love for Srila Prabhupada is evident with your knowing and understanding the mood of Srila Prabhupada from every little detail of his life. Your love for Srila Prabhupada is also seen in how you show your love, care, and affection to all your godbrothers and godsisters.\n\nThe biggest gift you have given to Srila Prabhupada is the restoration of the Bhaktivinod Bhaithak at the Ultadanga junction along with Srila Prabhupada’s birthplace in Kolkata. The place wherein the seed of ISKCON was sown is now accessible to devotees across the world.\nGeV, the Bhaktivedanta Hospital, and now a new hospital in Barsana are now inspiring thousands in India and across the world to take up the teachings of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\nJust like you express your gratitude for Srila Prabhupada, you never miss expressing your gratitude towards all the disciples, followers, and well-wishers in your classes.\nYou renamed your vyaspuja celebration as the \"Festival of Gratitude,\" considering this as a wonderful opportunity wherein everyone can openly express their gratitude towards their spiritual master, and you also express deep gratitude towards Srila Prabhupada and all our previous acharyas. In my view, this whole event is Prabhupada and Acharya-centric, as you keep yourself out of the limelight. In the last Festival of Gratitude, you didn\u0027t even take a vyas asan to give the address. You accepted a simple chair to sit wherein you were not seen at all.\nIn your quest for finding the Supreme Absolute Truth, you came across so many saints and babas – like Tat Wala Baba, the baba who gave you saintly robes in Rishikesh, Naga Babas, Ramesh Baba in Barsana, and many others. You learned from each one of them, remembering their teachings till date and expressing your gratitude towards them in your \"Journey Home\" book. Your heart was full of love and gratitude while you were eagerly making a request to the Sikh gentleman to allow you to enter India from the Ferozepur border.\n\nThe profound statement you gave in one of your lectures – \"A heart full of gratitude is the abode of the Lord\" – has personally touched me a lot. By your mercy, I started sharing the teachings of BG through the online Geeta Jivan sessions. It’s been 34 continuous weeks, and about 8-10 people join the classes, and a couple of them have started chanting. I am also regularly hearing the daily SPORT sessions taken by HG Mukundanand Pr Ji. On this auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja, I beg at your lotus feet and pray that I develop deep feelings of gratitude and realize the pains you have taken to give us the shelter of SP and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. That I realize the importance of this human form of life and utilize my time in the best possible way. I also beg forgiveness for my shortcomings and mistakes that I’ve made so far. Please bless me and my family so that we remain sincere in the path of Bhakti by following your instructions and remain grateful to you throughout life.\n\nYours in Service,\nGaurang, Shweta \u0026\nGaurav Mahajan"

When I witnessed your interactions with your Godbrothers and disciples, your humility, and how lovingly you offer respect to all, my heart was deeply moved.\nWhen I saw you offering dandavats to your disciples at NVCC and seeking their blessings, I realized the true essence of this verse.\nGurudev, I wish to say something from the deepest core of my heart — I am most fallen, unqualified, and insignificant, yet Gurudev, I love you from the very depths of my heart. Whether you accept me or not, I will always remain yours.\nGurudev, I have a small wish: I always dream of you visiting our Nitai Gaur Chandra’s house here in Sri Vrindavan Dham and blessing us with the opportunity to serve you.\nYour beloved child,\nDāsānudāsānudās"

She is the one who introduced me to this wonderful world of Krishna, Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam, yatras, devotees, and Maharaj.\n \n This is my first ever offering, and I thought offerings were given only by disciples to their beloved Guru Maharaj, until HG Padma Kishori mataji told me it\u0027s about expressing gratitude, so I decided to offer too. I am very, very grateful to be a part of this world. My first ever darshan of Maharaj was on Radhashtami at Chowpatty. The thing that touched me the most about Maharaj was the way he looked at all the devotees present, like all of us, with so much gratitude and love. It made me feel so welcomed and part of a family, with just one glance. I hadn\u0027t experienced anything like this before. From then onwards, there was no turning back. I couldn\u0027t visit Mumbai without visiting Chowpatty.\n \n And of course GEV! I have lost my heart there. You can feel Maharaj\u0027s presence everywhere there, even when He is not present, in all the small and big things. Like stainless steel buckets, electric vehicles inside the campus, waste segregation, and so many things. So much care, so much mindfulness for every living being. The dogs there are not just fed but also taken care of when not well. I personally saw one dog who was isolated and treated for a medical condition. The same goes with cats, and what to say of all the beautiful cows and bulls!\n By causeless mercy, I could also attend Kartik yatras for 3 consecutive years, and I\u0027m still in awe!\n \n There are so many things to express, but I am not able to find the correct words. I just wish to express my heartfelt gratitude!\n \n All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n All glories to Sri Guru and Gauranga!\n Hare Krishna 🙏"

However, by your causeless mercy, I have begun to realize the bitter perplexities of this material world, where I am bound to undergo so much trouble, one after another.\n\nThough I very much understand the miserable nature of this material existence, bondage in this material world is so strong that it is impossible to get out of this miserable world for anyone, including great yogis performing austerities for thousands of years. However, your shelter has at least enabled me to proceed on this divine path of bhakti, which surely uplifts one from the miserable material world to the blissful spiritual world.\n\nStill, despite my efforts to practice the principles of bhakti, illusion in the material world is so deep and strong that I often get carried away by its forces, though I try to restrain myself from it. Therefore, I earnestly beg for your divine grace so that I may remain steady on this path of bhakti with all determination and enthusiasm, without any material bewilderment and diversion.\n\nI humbly beg you to please bless me that:\n- I may always remain in Pure Krishna Consciousness, as a servant of servants, with humility and gratitude towards all the Vaishnavas.\n- I may remain fully absorbed in spreading the glories of Krishna \u0026 Srila Prabhupada.\n- and I may remain fully away from material desires, anarthas, and aparadhas throughout my life.\n\nThough I am not at all eligible, I pray to remain forever an insignificant beggar at your lotus feet…\nkṛṣṇa se tomāra, kṛṣṇa dite pāro, tomāra śakti āche,\nāmi tō kaṅgāla, kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa boli, dhāi tāva pāche pāche.\n\nAn insignificant beggar,\nGaurlila Das"

Please accept my most humble obeisances in the dust of your divine lotus feet.\n\nIt is a great pleasure and honor to have this opportunity to write an offering for your 75th year of most auspicious presence on this earthly plane. Writing an offering for you is like showing a lamp to the sun; though we know that our feeble attempt is bound to fall short, still the attempt to glorify and remember you is so joyful and enlivening that we cannot desist from it and are drawn to try.\n\nDear Maharaj, no words can properly glorify your deep, powerful, and impactful personality or properly express the impact that you have created in empowering, cajoling, and inspiring so many of us to pursue the only goal that will actually satisfy our parched souls - humble and loving service to the Supreme Divinity.\n\nI am very grateful for your presence amongst us in this time and age when the influence of Kaliyuga is permeating very thick and deep in our lives with powerful forces attempting to distract, deviate, and degrade from meaningful purpose to sensual gratification driven by profit-driven enterprises through smartphones, social media, and similar forces. Amidst all of these disruptive forces, your presence is a soothing calm for us, your disciples and well-wishers. It enables us to fight against these opposing forces within and without and, following in your footsteps, continue with a firm determination towards the only goal that will quench our eternal thirst.\n\n\"If you don\u0027t have anything in your life that you are ready to die for, you have nothing worth living for.\" This statement of yours has become a guiding light of my life, and it encourages me every day. Your personal example and journey, that we are fortunate to access due to the kind mercy of HH Bhakti Tirtha Maharaj, who requested you to write your autobiography, is the lifeblood for all your disciples and millions of other fortunate devotees and seekers around the world who have in their hands a genuine seeker\u0027s heart, feelings, conquests, struggles, and journey that is their inspirational light and guiding force for their own exploration of their journey in search of the truth.\n\nMaharaj, your life is a beautiful example of so many desired ideals. One among them that you have so amazingly exemplified is the unworldly example of cooperation, service, and taking everyone together in service to Srila Prabhupada. Your heart-warming qualities, deeply affectionate and humble comforting nature, and well-wishing empathy for others make you attractive and endearing for one and all - not only your disciples and students but also your godbrothers, seniors, other Vaishnavas from all sampradayas, and even those who may not be directly interested in spiritual life but are just onlooking bystanders. No one whose path has crossed you can resist the attraction to your pure personality, your child-like innocence and laughter, your deep sage-like composure, and your harmless, unimposing, yet profoundly powerful personality full of love and compassion for others and completely in alignment with the revealed instructions.\n\nOn this auspicious day, I would like to thank you for all the mercy that you have bestowed upon me directly through all the arrangements that you have made and the devotees whom you have inspired and instructed to act for others\u0027 welfare. The most recent and important devotee among them is dear Adi Gadadhar Prabhu, who is most attached to you and in whose person we can feel the impact of your love and in whose association, we feel the warmth of your devotion and compassion.

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Recently I listened to HG Vraj Bihari Prabhu’s offering for your 75th Vyasa-Puja. He shared how, in a recent counselors’ meeting, everyone asked you what gift should be offered to you on your 75th Vyasa-Puja day. And you replied that not just for this Vyasa-Puja, but anytime in the future, if anyone asks what gift you desire, your answer will always remain the same — and that answer includes the five points below.\n \n These are not only your instructions for us — they are qualities you have personally lived as a true acharya, one who teaches by example. You never ask anyone to do anything that you yourself have not practiced in your own life. You always walk your talk. And I wanted to express in this offering that the same five “gifts” you expect from us are the very same gifts you yourself have been offering to Srila Prabhupada throughout your life.\n \n Before expanding on each of them, I humbly delineate the five gifts you desire:\n \n 1. Go deep into hearing, chanting, and service\n 2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Guru and Krishna\n 3. Remain united as a community\n 4. Maintain enthusiasm to share bhakti\n 5. Never compromise on the quality of bhakti\n \n 1. Go Deep Into Hearing, Chanting \u0026 Service\n \n Your early brahmachari years in New Vrindavan are a living example of this instruction. You were constantly engaged in service, and in the brief moments between aratis you would dive into Srila Prabhupada’s books with great relish.\n \n I especially remember one Janmashtami night around 2002 or 2003, close to 1:30 a.m., when you joined a small gathering of us and lovingly shared how those few minutes of reading in between aratis were among the sweetest moments of your spiritual life.\n \n You always sat in the same spot near Hanumanji, surrounded by brahmacharis, chanting with such intensity that the entire atmosphere of the temple transformed.\n \n Your festival lectures — consistent year after year — revealed how deeply you had studied and realized those pastimes. And after hearing Srila Prabhupada’s lecture in the morning, you would eagerly share the essence with the brahmacharis the very same afternoon, sometimes even making it the theme of the next Sunday Feast class.\n \n From you we learned that true depth in bhakti comes only through steady hearing, sincere chanting, and tireless service.\n \n 2. Cultivate the Mood of Pleasing Guru and Krishna\n \n Over the years, we have seen how you always strive not only to please Guru and Krishna, but also to please your God brothers.\n \n You taught us that pleasing Guru includes loving Krishna, following instructions, imbibing Guru’s mood, dedicating one’s life to Guru’s mission, and understanding and supporting Guru’s projects.\n \n I remember you once telling the brahmacharis, “I have given you all you need. Now it is your responsibility to carry on the legacy — temple, congregation, projects…”\n \n Gauranga Prabhu once narrated that Srila Prabhupada had said that in the early years ISKCON consisted mostly of Westerners, and therefore there was a need to preach to Indians. Today the situation has reversed. Understanding Srila Prabhupada’s balanced mood, you are once again successfully attracting Western seekers — especially through Govardhan Eco Village and the Bhakti Center in New York.\n \n And even with these expanding projects, you have never compromised your principle of “people over projects.”\n \n 3. Remain United as a Community\n \n Unity has always been your core teaching.\n \n When you were with the brahmacharis, you would genuinely glorify the Grihasthas — their hard work, donations, and participation in temple programs. And when you were with the Hrihasthas, you would glorify the brahmacharis — their simplicity, sacrifice, and renunciation.\n \n Within ISKCON, you consistently taught us to respect every devotee — Prabhupada’s disciples and disciples of other Gurus.\n \n I vividly remember your instruction to Bhagavatam speakers: never say “my Guru Maharaj,” and not even casually say “Maharaj.” We had to say “Radhanath Swami says…” so that no listener — even if not your disciple — felt excluded or disconnected.\n \n Except during Vyasa-puja, we were strictly prohibited from publicly chanting your pranam mantra or saying “Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki jai,” even in your absence. This sensitivity demonstrated your deep concern for unity.\n \n During book distribution marathon, you would say: “Distribute more than last year — but let Chowpatty come last — so that other temples distribute even more and Srila Prabhupada’s mission expands.”\n \n Your humility and awareness taught us that unity must always take precedence over prestige.\n \n 4. Enthusiasm to Share Bhakti\n \n When I served in guest reception, I constantly saw your enthusiasm in meeting newcomers — whether in your small room, in the temple hall, or whenever special guests arrived.\n \n I took great pleasure in bringing guests to meet you, and you never refused — even when you were not feeling well. My greatest joy was seeing the warmth and satisfaction on your face when I introduced someone new.\n \n And we have all witnessed how this same enthusiasm extends across the world — how you travel extensively wherever you are invited to teach and share Krishna consciousness. You speak in corporates, temples, universities, parliaments, television interviews, meetings with celebrities, politicians, dignitaries, and also the simplest common people. Your compassion never discriminates. Your eagerness to share bhakti never diminishes.\n \n 5. Never Compromise on the Quality of Bhakti\n \n Srila Prabhupada said, “Now is the time to boil the milk” — to focus on training and caring for the devotees we already have.\n \n Bhagavad-gita teaches the same principle: Krishna accepts the quality of devotion, not the quantity “patram pushpam phalam toyam”. And from your New Vrindavan days until today, we have seen that wherever there is genuine quality, Krishna naturally brings quantity.\n \n My Prayer:\n \n On your 75th Vyasa-puja, I sincerely pray:\n – For your good health\n – For unlimited empowerment in uplifting and inspiring Western audiences\n – And for your mercy, so that I may cultivate these five gifts in my own life and offer them to you not only on Vyasa-puja day, but every single day\n Your servant,\n Gokulananda Das"

With certain revelations and retrospection of the institution of the Gurukula, as well as witnessing an underlying weary or disengaged attitude towards devotional service from some of my closest gurukul friends, as a result of said revelations; I too felt cynicism and jadedness creep in my heart where simplicity and conviction should be.\n\nStill, I held on to my japa and the four regulations, for I knew that if I let go, things would only drastically worsen. I also wanted to maintain a baseline of spiritual purity because I still hoped to receive initiation from you, Guru Maharaj. How could I shamelessly beg for you to accept me if I didn’t meet the minimum level of commitment? My hope to be one day accepted and ultimately become of service to you was a source of sustenance to my malnourished bhakti creeper.\n\nIn essence, Guru Maharaj, I am so very grateful that you have accepted me as your formal disciple. I plan, hope, and pray that I can do something significant for furthering Srila Prabhupada’s mission. Knowing that I have your blessings, it all seems more possible. I apologize that I have rambled on about mainly myself. On this holy day, I should be glorifying you and your divine qualities, yet somehow I ended up talking about myself. I promise that I’ll do a better job next year and every year after that.\n\nYour humble servant,\nGopal Candra Dasa"

I ponder the lessons you taught silently in those cherished moments.\n \n 1\n I first saw you in the Pune yatra 2008,\n And immediately got this message straight\n Of how much mutual love\n And cooperation meant to you,\n By seeing how you treated your god-brothers\n And sisters with all the love and care due,\n And through your asking us to form\n Many small circles around\n To dance together happily\n During the enchanting kirtan rounds.\n \n It was also my first chance\n To hear from you the trinadapi sunichena verse,\n Of being more tolerant than a tree\n And more humble than a blade of grass.\n A virtue that you practice yourself and emphasize\n Again and again in almost every class.\n \n 2\n I first approached you in New Vrindaban,\n With the innocent impudence of a neophyte,\n To seek your mercy and blessings for\n Our newly conceived maiden child.\n You sweetly responded with a brimming heart\n That you would pray with all your might.\n So much love shown to a stranger,\n Leaving her fully satisfied.\n \n 3\n Then you came to our home\n For lunch the one and only time,\n And taught many lessons\n By your gestures and actions pristine.\n \n Instead of ordering your preferences,\n You asked where we wanted you to sit.\n Such a humility and service attitude,\n Totally incomprehensible to our wit.\n \n You offered due prayers\n Before honoring prasad,\n Giving a peek into your\n Surrendered and grateful heart.\n \n And then when I mentioned\n That I hailed from Nainital,\n You immediately brought up\n Neem Karoli Baba and Kainchi dham.\n Hidden behind this simple exchange\n Was a beautiful virtue at its best,\n Of never forgetting those who played\n A role in your spiritual quest.\n \n 4\n Then when you gave me my first initiation\n In Sri Sri Radha Kalachandji dham,\n Your servant of the servant mood\n Was the first thing that touched my heart.\n You accepted us all on behalf of\n The guru parampara and Srila Prabhupada.\n \n The next was how much love and respect\n You showed to your godbrothers at that time.\n You generously glorified Srila Gurudev,\n HH Bhakti Sundar Goswami Maharaj\n And Urjasvat Prabhu\u0027s qualities sublime.\n \n And to see you sharing the vyasaasan\n Lovingly during the fire sacrifice\n With HH Bhakti Sundar Goswami Maharaj,\n Oh, what a feast it was for our hearts and eyes!\n \n And, of course! Your all-encompassing instructions\n Given to us at that auspicious time\n Are all that I would ever need\n To succeed in my spiritual life—\n \n Understanding our true eternal self\n As a servant of the servant of Krishna’s servant,\n And surrendering to His limitless love,\n An ocean for all of us individually meant.\n \n The three pillars of naam ruchi, vaishnava seva, and jiva daya,\n Explained in the specific context of our temple,\n Strengthened by the four regulative principles\n And the virtue of never ever being critical.\n \n And your re-emphasizing the right mood\n For all services that we perform\n During my second initiation,\n Again in SS Radha Kalachandji temple room,\n By instructing me to chant my first Gayatri\n For the pleasure of Their Lordships\u0027 divine form.\n \n 5\n Another important of our direct exchanges\n Was during Sadhu Sanga retreat in Boon.\n My boldly bringing a godbrother and sister\n And telling you that they were expecting soon.\n Your acknowledging that fact,\n But at the same time remaining stern,\n And in that grave moment,\n Teaching me a lesson firm\n That the spiritual master is not\n Meant to satisfy our whims,\n But it is for us, in turn,\n To reverentially serve Him.\n \n 6\n Subsequently, I have had the good fortune\n Of attending many Kartik yatras\n And witnessing your enthusiasm\n For speaking Sri Hari kathas.\n Your speaking for hours together\n With such details and flair\n That everyone can picture those pastimes\n As if happening right then and there,\n Embellished with special effects of sound,\n Yet, bringing out lessons most profound.\n And with what a delightful kirtan\n Each lecture roaringly ends,\n Making the ocean of devotees\n Jubilantly dance to their hearts’ content.\n \n 7\n However, the most endearingly\n Etched in my mind\n Are your visits to our dear\n Sri Sri Radha Kalachandji dham divine.\n \n A\n I will always remember that scene here\n Of your performing arati\n For Srila Prabhupada\u0027s guru puja\n With utmost diligence and gravity,\n Showcasing towards His guru\n A disciple\u0027s servitude and chastity.\n \n B\n And then your attending so many\n Outreach programs here back to back,\n Without any consideration for health\n Or trace of any slack.\n \n C\n In the disciples’ meetings here both times,\n You shared with us your extraordinary flair\n Of drawing lessons from ordinary things\n In our surroundings that may be there.\n \n The first time, you sighted the Lindsley Park tree,\n Fallen down by a tornado but surviving still,\n And continuing serving others\n Completely at their disposal and will.\n And the next time, you mentioned\n The kadamba tree in Chowpatty temple premise,\n Growing in a peculiar distorted way,\n Bending at random spots seeking sunlight,\n Thus dealing with the darkness\n By putting up a good fight.\n \n D\n And when at one of the meetings’ end,\n Rasaraj Prabhuji announced\n That we all must get back to our respective services\n For your ‘Journey Within’ book launch,\n You melted our hearts by immediately asking\n What services you needed to perform.\n \n E\n And I will always cherish seeing you\n Sitting in our temple chanting the holy names,\n And observing with great interest\n The architectural beauty of this holy place,\n And later glorifying this beautiful offering\n Made to Srila Prabhupada by Srila Gurudev,\n And your dancing in the darshan arati\n With spontaneous feelings and grace.\n \n 8\n And then how can I end\n Without thanking you for all\n The mercy, kindness, and love bestowed\n Upon us insignificant souls—\n Your loving embrace to my Prabhuji,\n My father-in-law and father alike.\n Your naming both of our kids and\n Doing their first grain ceremony rite,\n Blessing them with the gentle tap\n Of your fingers on their forehead.\n Your giving my father the cake tray\n And your maha prasad garland.\n My mother and I\n Getting a chance to cook for you,\n And me getting to make\n Garlands for you too.\n Your initiating my in-laws\n As well as my parents,\n And your calling Kirtida back\n To give her prasadam remnants.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, as I reminisce about these moments, many more come to mind of receiving your mercy directly and indirectly in many forms. May I never forget how much I have been given. May I always cherish this treasure and always draw nourishment and spiritual strength from it. May my connection with you only grow stronger and stronger with time, and may I get the strength to practice earnestly what you have taught. My heartfelt gratitude to you, Sri Sri Radha Kalachandji, Sri Sri Radha Gopinath ji, and all the devotees who became the via media of channeling this grace.\n Wishing you a very happy 75th appearance day again,\n \n Your daughter,\n Gopi Vallabhi devi dasi"

You said when we are initiated, the initial name is not important; however, the last part \"Das\" is most important.\n \n Your roaring kirtans during the yatra remind us of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who inaugurated the congregational chanting of holy names and gives a glimpse of the ecstatic happiness of the spiritual world.

        "Your Offering ":  "75th VYASA PUJA OF GURU-MAHARAJ - HH RADHANATH SWAMI\n\nDear Guru Maharaj,\nKindly accept my humble, prostrated obeisances unto the dust of your lotus feet. All glories to your divine personality. All glories to Sri Guru \u0026 Gauranga. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa-Puja ceremony, I wish to write a few words of glorification of your exalted personality and also to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude for your mercy and compassion on this fallen, conditioned soul.\n\nDear Guru-Maharaj, your life is a life of sacrifice and austerity. As we read in your book, ‘The Journey Home,’ the incidents and the near-death experiences that you endured to find your true calling are really mind-boggling. Once you found your path, your inner journey on the path of Bhakti began. We hear from you and also from the devotees how you practiced Bhakti in New Vrindavan in utmost austere conditions. Your complete surrender to Srila Prabhupada was exhibited by your full submission to the authority, without any complaints or fault-finding. You truly followed the mood of being a servant of the servant. Krishna extracted the price from you, and you humbly and successfully paid the price. You won the heart of Srila Prabhupada, the Guru Parampara, and ultimately Krishna, who all rewarded you with great preaching success in America and then in Mumbai, where you developed a great devotee congregation centered around Radha Gopinath temple. Many with high degrees like medicine, IIT grads, and big businessmen, etc., surrendered their lives to your mission in pleasing Srila Prabhupada. Another landmark success was achieved under your leadership by the development of Govardhan Eco Village GEV – a beautiful farm on the outskirts of Mumbai. This was created to attract foreign tourists who can experience spirituality in the lush, serene atmosphere and also be inspired to live a Vedic lifestyle of simple living and high thinking. Your book ‘Journey Home’ was a great success, and then your second book, ‘Journey Within,’ became a New York Times Best Seller through the efforts of all disciples and well-wishers. Needless to mention your wonderful and joyful yearly Yatras to holy places, which we all eagerly look forward to participating in every year. This year, about 12,000 devotees attended, and I was completely astonished by how smoothly it was conducted and also by your inspiration, how so many devotees served in various services, especially the kitchen. Your Yatras bring out within our hearts the feelings of humility and gratitude for what we are receiving, and by seeing the devotees\u0027 tireless service attitude, our hearts melt.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, you are the personification of Vaishnava seva, Nama ruchi, and Jiva doya, which you live by every moment. The most important aspect of Bhakti is Hearing, and your wonderful classes are full of your deep, profound realizations, hearing which my desert-like heart is nourished and becomes joyful. Hearing your classes keep me focused towards the goal amidst so many distractions.\n\nThank you so much, GuruMaharaj, for all the wonderful gifts you have given, and I pray that I always remain in the association of your sincere disciples and be inspired to follow your instructions and live up to your standards and expectations that you have set for all of us.\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your 75th birthday, we all pray to Krishna for your good health and long life and great success in your mission to please Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour insignificant servants of the servants of your glorious servants,\n\nGovinda Sundara das\nPrema Vinodini Devi dasi\nLalitha Sakhi"

Still, I wish to offer a few words as an expression of my gratitude, knowing that whatever sincerity I have is a gift from you alone.\nYou have taught us that every circumstance in life — whether joyous or painful — can become an opportunity to deepen our relationship with Kṛṣṇa. When I look at my own journey, I can see that every step of progress I have made, every spark of faith or desire for service, has come solely through your compassion. Even my awareness of how dependent I am on your mercy is itself your mercy.\nLately, I realize more deeply your presence manifests through the devotees who guide us locally. The teachings of His Grace the late Tapas Prabhu continue to sustain the Maha Mantra Lab, a small program we run with the family here in Cochabamba Bolivia - South America. How beautiful it has been to know that you accompanied him in his last glorious days of service in our beloved ISKCON Stockholm community.\nAlso, the guidance and association of His Grace Brajasundara Pr. from IBMV Vrindavana and Her Grace Premamayi Devi TKG that is always calling us to visit her in the Holy Dham. The support, protection, and affectionate presence of His Holiness Dhanvantari Swami and his disciples are also your kindness reaching us. Through all of them and all other śikṣā gurus that kindly instruct us and give us their association, I can receive your guidance and care, reminding me that your mercy flows in so many forms and directions, touching every heart — even of a worm such as my own — and that the great compassion of Śrīla Prabhupāda in giving us ISKCON to meet and serve together has no parallel in the three worlds.\nThrough your example, Maharaj, I am learning the importance of respecting every living being, the power of the Holy Name, the meaning of service to others as a service to You. Although I often struggle to approach devotional life with humility and gratitude, and to follow your instructions properly, I find solace in your patience and kindness. You continue to reach out to us, even when we are lost in forgetfulness, reminding us that Kṛṣṇa never abandons His children. That message alone sustains me. In your words and actions, I feel the presence of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s love, and it gives me irrefutable proof that the process of bhakti is real, alive, and ever-fresh.\nMaharaj, thank you for everything. I pray to remain under the shadow of your lotus feet, life after life, trying to make conscious decisions to make my heart gradually a suitable place for Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa to reside.\nThank you for everything, most dear beloved Master, on the auspicious day of your appearance.\nGovindanandini dd."

Whatever little Krishna consciousness I have today is only because you touched my life with your compassion.\n \n I still vividly remember the first time I saw you in 1999 at Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Mandir, Chowpatty. It was Janmashtami night — my very first Janmashtami in the temple — and you were giving the festival lecture. I did not know anything at that time, but I felt something awakening in my heart. Your words, your humility, your devotion, and the purity coming from you planted the first seed of bhakti in my life.\n \n By your mercy, I received initiation in 2001. That moment remains the greatest blessing of this lifetime. I had no qualification then, and even today I have no qualification, but your kindness continues to carry me.\n \n Today, Krishna has placed me in Kampala, Uganda, where I am trying in a small way to share whatever I have learned from you — through preaching, seva, organizing programs, and helping devotees. Whatever service happens here is only your mercy. Your teachings on compassion, simplicity, humility, and sincerity guide me every day.\n \n Gurudev, in this material world I make many mistakes, but your instructions always bring me back to the right path.

Once in Jagannath Puri, at Tota Gopinath temple, I was sitting in the temple after paying for the coupon and eagerly waiting for the Lord’s prasadam. A stranger, who was not even an ISKCON member, but seeing me in my dhoti and kurta attire, asked me, “From ISKCON?”\n “Yes,” I replied. He further asked, “Which temple are you from?” I said, “Chowpatty, Mumbai.” He asked again, “Who is your Guru?” I said, “HH. Srila Radhanath Swami.”\n Suddenly, he gave a big smile and said, “Oh, then your life is perfected.” That day, I did not take it so seriously. But when I reflect on those words now, I realize that actually, I do not have any qualifications apart from one: that you have accepted me as your disciple.\n Dear Gurudev, on this auspicious occasion of your birthday, I wish to promise you again that I will always try to be a sincere devotee and will make sure that I fulfill all my vows given to you at the time of initiation.

Your subtle way of dealing with and destroying all my confusions through your inspiring classes has always been encouraging for a fallen condition soul like me.

I always feel so blessed when I am realizing the devotional nectar that you impart through your words, actions, and even sometimes without even saying something.\n \n Your glances are so purifying, and your smile never leaves my heart. With an immense, prayerful heart, I wish that your loving blessings and concerns never leave our lives.

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna, dear Guru Maharaj! Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n \n On this sacred day of your appearance, please let me try to express what is there in my heart. There is gratitude for Your being there in my life, for giving sense to everything with Your presence and Your example. You embody everything that You make us strive for, and what is most important - You give us an example of what it means to be a disciple. Watching You, I dream that a day will come when I will also give You my heart, as You have given Yours to Srila Prabhupada, and that someday I will also give myself completely to following Your instructions.\n \n I am trying, but I feel so small and weak. I am taken away by the waves of the mind and senses. But Your feet are my anchor. Please let me hold on to it tightly and feel Your love.\n \n Each of Your disciples is unlimitedly dear to You, even though physically You cannot be with all of them. With such emotion, You always tell the story of how Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur refused to conduct a temple opening ceremony until one single brahmachari returned.\n \n You are an embodiment of this story. No projects has ever meant to You more than even the most insignificant person You meet. You always see even the smallest service of the devotees and express Your gratitude. How many hours of Your life have You spent for communicating with people in Your attempt to help them become closer to Krishna?! How many sleepless nights have You had, listening to all those who came to You to express their heart?! You keep extending Yourself without limit for those who need it. And so many times You spoke of how You would like to be with all of You disciples personally 24/7, but it is humanly impossible.\n \n Still, I know that a sincere disciple can always be with his guru. Srila Prabhupada says that there can be no separation if a disciple tries to follow the instructions of his spiritual master. \"The spiritual master is present everywhere where a sincere disciple is trying to serve his instructions. It is possible by Krishna\u0027s mercy. In Your attempts to serve me and in all of You sincere devotional sentiments, I am with you as my Guru Maharaj is with me. Always remember that.\"\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, while writing all this, I understand I have nothing to say to You. You know my heart. Please let me, in spite of choosing words, start living in such a way that will please You. Once You told that true Vyasa-puja is when a devotee glorifies his spiritual master with his actions.\n \n Please let my life become an offering to You and those dear to You. Please let me become Your instrument. By Your mercy, Krishna may fill this heart with love, and then I will be able to leave the prison of my selfishness and start giving love to others. Please let me make others\u0027 happiness the meaning of my life, and please make me qualified to help those who are dear to those who serve You.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Hari Priti dd"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n \n Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n You are the most compassionate servant of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Gopīnātha and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. All glories to the divine current of love that flows through your words, your smile, and your life of service.\n \n On this sacred Vyāsa-pūjā day, my heart overflows with gratitude for the inconceivable mercy you have bestowed upon me. If there is any flicker of faith, hope, or desire for devotion within me, it has arisen only because of your shelter. I am not at all qualified to be your disciple, but you have shown your compassion and given me hope by holding my finger and helping me navigate through the strong current of material desires.\n \n When I reflect on your life and teachings, three qualities shine like brilliant gems—your mercy, your gratitude, and your humility.\n \n Mercy -\u003e We all know how merciful you are. You didn’t care about my qualifications. Just to please your godbrother, you accepted me under your shelter because he cares about me. You didn’t think if I would meet the standards your esteemed disciples have or whether I would be loyal to you and your teachings. You don’t see what we are, but just how by Krishna’s mercy, we can grow in our spiritual life and be a soldier in Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s movement. I had always a desire to be a loyal soldier under this mission, and you kindly gave me my name, which resonated well with what I wanted to be. Who else can know my heart other than my beloved spiritual master?\n \n Gratitude -\u003e Each and every word you speak reflects the depth of your gratitude—to your spiritual master, Śrīla Prabhupāda, to your godbrothers, and to every devotee who renders even the smallest service. By your example, you have taught us that gratitude is the foundation of love. You see Kṛṣṇa’s hand behind every circumstance and every person, and in doing so, you transform even suffering into sacred opportunity. In your presence, we learn that true gratitude is not spoken—it is lived. I still live by your teaching, that we should be grateful for every opportunity that we get to perform devotional service and in that mood render service. This one single teaching has been a turning point in my life on how I approach each and every service that comes my way. There is still a long way to perfectly harmonize this, but as long as I remain even minutely grateful to you, I know that I will succeed in my spiritual endeavors.\n \n Humility -\u003e Your humility humbles us all. Though you are a leader with such a great following and have thousands of disciples and inspired a million others, you consider yourself the servant of everyone, a humble straw at their lotus feet, ready to render service to them. When I first approached you to take your shelter, you asked me, “How can I serve you?” Who other than the most humble person can do that? You emphasize always on *trinad api sunicena*, and your life is characterized by this. You see Krishna in everyone’s heart and thus you are ready to bow before even the youngest devotee, seeing in them the spark of Kṛṣṇa’s mercy. Your humility is not weakness—it is the strength that draws the Lord to your heart. By your example, we learn that the essence of leadership is service, performing even the most menial service in the most joyful way.\n \n You have taught us that Bhakti is not just theory, but we have to cultivate it by being humble, being grateful, and being merciful to one and all. Thank you very much for being in my life.\n \n I once again offer my Dandavat praṇāms at your lotus feet and pray that one day I can be qualified to be your disciple.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Hari Sankirtan Das."

He guided us to take up some of those services which can please you the most.\nThese are:\n\n1. We will be inviting devotees trained personally by you, who had your very close personal association, who you gave personal instructions to, and who are living their lives as per your guidance and instructions. We will hear from them about your intimate teachings which they want to reveal to us, so that we can appreciate and connect with your Holiness in deeper, loving gratitude and devotion.\n\n2. Each one of the families in our counselee group will be inviting, in a year, at least 6 families of devotees 1 family at a time to their homes. We will be discussing Krishna Katha, Srila Prabhupada Katha, Sri Guru Katha, or any suitable spiritual topic. This will help us to develop relationships and solidify our bonds in the community as one family.\n\n3. We will be chanting 75 rounds of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra together in our counselee group around 30 families on December 25th, 2025, and dedicate the rounds at the service of Your Lotus Feet.\n\nWe beg to accept our humble and feeble attempts in your loving service.\n\nWe would also like to submit before you that our counselee group celebrated the Vyasa Puja of HDG Srila Prabhupada in a way that would surely please you. Every year we celebrate HDG Shrila Prabhupada’s Vyasa Puja since 2011 in our group with different themes.\n\nThis year, a theme of offerings was: \"Disciples of HDG Srila Prabhupada, their intimate spiritual service and relationship with him\".\n\nEach family presented the offering from the perspective of a particular disciple of HDG Srila Prabhupada. Devotees could immerse themselves in overwhelming divine emotions exhibited by each of the disciples’ personal flavor of mood of devotion. They learned this particular mood of surrender from either their books or by their offerings to HDG Shrila Prabhupada.\n\nThe atmosphere was deeply connecting to each of Srila Prabhupada’s disciples, especially because of a \u0027wall very lovingly decorated with their pictures\u0027 and a \u0027table having some of the books\u0027 they have published.\n\nWe are truly very fortunate and feeling grateful to be under the loving care of your diligently trained disciples.\n\nI beg you to make me a servant of the servant of the servant of your servants.\n\nWe desperately need your grace and deeply appreciate especially your books, your lectures, your disciples, devotee communities, temples, farm projects, hospitals, Yatras, and the counsellor system you have established.\n\nPlease forgive our offenses and accept us in your eternal service.\n\nYour Servant,\nHaridham das, Vedvati dasi\nISKCON Nigdi"

Dear Gurudev!!\n\nOur humble obeisances to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Dev, Sri Sri Gopal ji and Sri Sri Gaura Nitai!!\n\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Birth Anniversary, I am feeling so very grateful to have your amazing and transformational association in our lives.\n\nOn this most sacred and auspicious day of your Vyāsa-pūjā, I bow my head and heart at your lotus feet, offering this simple garland of words, insufficient yet sincere, in gratitude for your causeless mercy.\n\n🌺 1. Guru as the Embodiment of Bhagavān’s Compassion\n\nThe Bhāgavatam commands:\n\nācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān\nnāvamanyeta karhicit\nna martya-buddhyāsūyeta\nsarva-deva-mayo guruḥ\nSB 11.17.27\n\n“Know the ācārya to be My very self.”\n\nWhen I reflect on this verse, I understand how your presence in my life is Kṛṣṇa’s direct arrangement. You are His compassion incarnate—guiding, correcting, protecting, and illuminating my path with the torchlight of transcendental knowledge.\n\nWithout such guidance, I would wander endlessly through countless births, pursuing mirages of material happiness. Your mercy has given direction to a directionless soul.\n\n🌿 2. The Necessity of Approaching Guru\n\nThe Bhāgavatam says:\n\ntasmād guruṁ prapadyeta\njijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam\nSB 11.3.21\n\n“One seeking the highest good must surrender to a bona fide guru.”\n\nCompelled by suffering, yet pulled by hope, I came to your lotus feet—not knowing what I needed, but knowing you held the key to everything worthwhile. By your instructions, “śreyaḥ” began to awaken within me: a dormant longing for eternal service, a desire to love Kṛṣṇa above all else.\n\nYour words cut the bonds of ignorance, just as the sun disperses morning fog.\n\n🔥 3. The Power of Sadhu-Saṅga and the Guru’s Instructions\n\nLord Kapila teaches:\n\nsatāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido\nbhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ\nSB 3.25.25\n\nIn your association, your words enter not only my ears but my heart. Your hari-kathā intoxicates the soul and awakens a longing for the path of devotion.\n\nBy hearing from you, faith becomes conviction; conviction becomes service; and service becomes love. Thus, as Kapiladeva concludes, śraddhā, rati, and bhakti naturally arise by serving the devotees.\n\n🌸 4. Only by Guru’s Mercy Can One Approach the Lord\n\nPrahlāda Mahārāja states:\n\nnaiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghriṁ\nspriśaty anarthāpagamo yad-arthaḥ\nmahīyasāṁ pāda-rajo’bhiṣekaṁ\nniṣkiñcanānāṁ na vṛṇīta yāvat\nSB 7.5.32\n\nWithout the dust of the great souls’ feet, no one can approach the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.\n\nIt is that dust—your dust—which has sanctified my life.\nTo be allowed to carry even a particle of your instruction is the wealth of lifetimes.\nBy bathing in that sacred dust, the stains of anarthas begin to fade, and the soul remembers its true identity.\n\n🌼 5. Guru Opens the Door to Liberation\n\nṚṣabhadeva teaches:\n\nmahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimukteḥ\nSB 5.5.2\n\n“Service to great souls opens the door to liberation.”\n\nFor me, this means that serving you—your instructions, your mission, your devotees—is the only highway to freedom.\n\nYour compassion has opened a door not only to liberation but to something far greater: an invitation to serve in the loving domain of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.\n\n🌿 6. The Guru as the One Who Awakens Taste for Bhakti\n\nThe Bhāgavatam begins its instructions with the foundation of spiritual life:\n\nsyān mahat-sevayā viprāḥ\npuṇya-tīrtha-niṣevaṇāt\nSB 1.2.16\n\nBy serving great souls, one gains taste for Vāsudeva-kathā.\nIt is by your mercy that the holy name has become sweet, the scriptures alive, and service meaningful.\n\nWithout your guidance, I would still be entangled in the illusions of material identity, unaware of the treasure hidden within the heart.\n\n🌺 7. My Humble Prayer\n\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam often glorifies the disciple\u0027s mood:\n\nyasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo\nyasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto’pi\n\n“By the mercy of the guru one gets the mercy of Kṛṣṇa; without it, there is no advancement.”\n\nThis truth resounds in every step of my life.\nIf I have any hope, it is because of you.\nIf I have any strength, it is borrowed from you.\nIf I have any devotion, it is planted by you.\n\n🙏 8. Conclusion – My Offering at Your Feet\n\nGurudeva, on this most auspicious day of your Vyāsa-pūjā, I offer:\n\nmy mind—though restless, I place it at your feet;\nmy words—imperfect, yet longing to glorify you;\nmy heart—impure, yet yearning for your shelter;\nmy life—may it be used wholly in your service.\nPlease bless me with:\n\nunwavering faith in your instructions,\nthe strength to follow your example,\nhumility in service,\nand the aspiration to become a servant of your servants.\nMay I forever remain a particle of dust at your lotus feet.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nseeking shelter,\nHarivallabha Dasa and Kumari Devi Dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurudeva,\n \nPlease accept my most humble obeisances in the dust of your lotus feet.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n The arrival of this most auspicious day reminds us of the divine words in Śrī-bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta which Nārāyaṇa speaks to his devotee Gopa-kumāra who, after his spectacular journey spanning multiple planetary systems and beyond in the search for his desired goal, has arrived in Vaikuntha. Welcoming Gopa-kumāra, Nārāyaṇa sighs anxiously, remarking that until then, how many lifetimes Gopa-kumāra had spent without paying attention to Him. \"I was dancing like a fool,\" Nārāyaṇa, overwhelmed with love, addresses himself so, as He has been waiting lifetimes after lifetimes for Gopa-kumāra. Couldn\u0027t He force Gopa-kumāra? No, the Lord never tries to change the nature of the little jīva who seems to prefer bondage from time immemorial, or the nature of māyā who prefers to bind the jīvas for so long too.\n \n Gurudeva, this is the condition of this fallen, wretched servant of yours. It seems as though bahirmukhatā—tendency to turn away from Kṛṣṇa—has become a part of me. Is there any sign of hope?\n \n But Bhagavān is an influencer. The next words Nārāyaṇa speaks in the same passage of Śrī-bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta melts my heart in hope. Crying in joy, Nārāyaṇa says, \"You showed me no mercy, and as I considered this, I grew impatient, full of anxiety to receive your favor. So, I transgressed my eternal code of conduct and arranged for you to take your current birth. Dear boy, in that divine district of Govardhana, my most beloved abode, I myself became your guru, known by the name Jayanta.\"\n \n Outcome—finally Gopa-kumāra basks in the loving embrace of Bhagavān.\n \n On this day, remembering this heart-rendering exchange penned by Śrīla Sanātana Goswāmi, my dark heart palpitates with mixed feelings. Gratitude soars in the heart on one hand, that in order to resolve the impasse between my belligerence to remain turned away from Kṛṣṇa and māyā\u0027s constant torment, Kṛṣṇa has surely intervened by sending you—the embodiment of His energy and mercy—to take me out of this precarious situation. On the other hand, there is gloom in the heart, that when will I really understand the good fortune that has been bestowed causelessly—of being initiated and allowed shelter under the lotus feet of a perfect spiritual master in a bonafide lineage; of the most rare opportunity to follow in the footsteps of the eternal Vrajavāsī like yourself to reach the perfection of loving devotional service in the groves of Śrī Vṛndāvana as the servant of the servant of Śrī Rādhā.\n \n With straw in my mouth, and kaṇṭha on my neck, I fall at your lotus feet today on the most auspicious day of your appearance. I know my deliverance would be predicated primarily on Kṛṣṇa\u0027s mercy coming through you, still, as a fledgling soul with free will, I sincerely recommit to make your instructions the center stage of my life and to the best of my capacities endeavor to that effect, to make your will and not my ego the guiding light of my sojourn in this material world. And in this way, I pray to keep that hope burning, the hope which kept Gopa-kumāra alive in his search for perfection.\n \n I pray to the cintāmaṇi dhāma of Śrī Vṛndāvana and Śrī Vṛndāvanēśvarī Rādhā that they bestow the best of health to you, so that you may be here with us for long and long years, pleasing Śrīla Prabhupāda in leaps and leaps, engaging us in your service to him more and more.\n \n Śrī Rādhe\n \n Harivaṁśa Dāsa"

        "country":  "India",
        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Guru Maharaja\n Please accept my humble obeisances\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada\n All glories to Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga\n Maharaja we wanted to express words of gratitude on this 75th Vyasa Puja of yours. It has been 14 years since we came to know about you. I was in my first year and I was introduced to your visit to Kolkata during Nityananda Trayodasi - unfortunately, I didn\u0027t turn up for that event. Shortly after this I read \"The Journey Home\" and I was spellbound by the book, especially how Krishna intervened at every crucial juncture of your life Maharaja - dog biting when the visa was over, Hare Krishna mahamantra being revealed to you by Mother Ganges etc. I was specially inspired to serve in Kolkata because you had said in one lecture that half of your life lies in Kolkata. The more I got to know about you, the more I was amazed, enthralled, fascinated and inspired by your life, some of which I am going to share today.\n \n We see you as an epitome of Vaisnava relationships - how you glorify every Srila Prabhupada disciple - so many instances we heard you showering praise on Srila Prabhupada disciples with regard to what services they carried out for Srila Prabhupada. In fact, we know about so many Srila Prabhupada disciples by your exclusive lectures on them. I was especially very inspired by your association with HH Bhakti Tirtha Swami Maharaja - how you cared for Maharaja, had such a deep, loving bond of friendship and what are the depths of spiritual friendship. Once when a guest came to Chowpatty late in the night, you requested HH Chandramauli Maharaja to vacate his room and shift to the brahmacari asrama because there was no other way a room can be arranged at such a short notice; next day in Mangal Arati you were apologizing to him for the inconvenience caused.\n \n In your lectures, we find many instructions which are very crucial for our growth, progress and safety in Krishna consciousness. I remember when we just landed up in the association of devotees, many things were very difficult for us to compile, understand and maneuver through. That time we found a lot of shelter in your lectures, Maharaja - we remember listening to some of the lectures around 10-15 times!!! All those lectures helped us go beyond the various crises and struggles in our Krishna consciousness. And the reason your lectures contain such depth, meaning and substance to deal with challenges, I understood when I heard the lecture series entitled \"My Life at New Vrindavan\" and another lecture by HH Bhakti Vijnana Goswami Maharaja. Despite so many hardships in New Vrindavan, especially when everyone was following a complex tradition, you never gave up your commitment and chastity to Srila Prabhupada. HH Bhakti Vijnana Goswami Maharaja told that you asked him to continue staying in Russia that time because you had stayed back in New Vrindavan, the sole reason being the fact that devotees can have someone to take shelter of. Even in such an environment, you never criticized, complained and offended anyone and carried on with your services. And such incredible tapasya!!! Infathomable!!! When one devotee didn\u0027t care for you when you fell down from the pony, you never had grudges against that devotee - this is very, very difficult. That holds true for much of your stay in New Vrindavan. When all your preaching projects in USA were stopped, it must have hurt you - but you never complained. I once heard that you kept records of various ups and downs in New Vrindavan, not because of fault-finding, but because you wanted to keep a record of what not to do in a temple - all those things were incredibly taken care of when you took up and grew ISKCON Chowpatty. When we hear about HG Radheshyam Prabhu, HG Gauranga Prabhu, HG Shyamananda Prabhu, HG Radha Gopinath Prabhu and HG Vrindavan Prabhu regarding the initial days in Chowpatty, we are amazed how you transformed the temple by your example, purity and instructions. When they share about their questions they posed to you and what amazing answers you gave, it\u0027s just out of the box; rooted in deep, KC philosophy and practical to the highest degree. Some of them are as follows:\n 1 We never thought we are qualified enough to get the personal association of Srila Prabhupada.\n 2 Q - Who should we allow to sing in the temple? Ans - If the devotee is very advanced, we should give him singing for the Deities even if he is not such a good singer. But if there are new people around...\n 3 Q - How can I know in a particular situation whether I am following what you want me to follow and you are not around for guidance? Ans - If you sincerely follow what I have told you to follow, then Krishna will inspire you to do what I want you to do when I am not available for guidance.\n 4 Q - How to tolerate devotees? Ans - Just tolerate them the way I am tolerating you.\n 5 We should honestly avoid the association of the opposite sex.\n 6 Q - What to do when we know that some devotee is treading wrong trajectories and his downfall is certain? Ans - We should have some means to ensure that he stops doing that. If he is not listening, we can just leave them, and whatever has to happen will happen to them.\n 7 Look at any situation from three levels: how it affects the individual devotee, how it affects the society of devotees, and how it impacts the outside people. Then make appropriate decisions.\n 8 Q - How do you have so many loving relationships despite having differences of opinion? Ans - I focus on the similarities and do not focus on the differences.\n 9 Even if we struggle, foam in the mouth, undergo hardships, to bring just a smile on the face of Vaisnavas, we should happily do it.\n 10 If you don\u0027t have something to die for, there\u0027s nothing you can live for.\n Especially your example - when we are in any confusion, especially when it seems that we are about to shout at devotees, then we remember what would you have done in such a situation. That completely removes the fog of confusion and dispels all our doubts and gives us the strength to do what is right. In the 13th Chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna tells about the 18 items of knowledge - there He mentions that one who knows this knowledge will never be bound. This is very distinctly visible in your life.\n \n Your philosophical understanding is amazing. In one of your question and answer sessions during the early days of Chowpatty, you had mentioned that just by our efforts we cannot chant the Holy Names of the Lord. We need the mercy and blessings of Vaisnavas, and we acquire that by serving the devotees, doing Vaisnava seva. This integral aspect of devotional service was not my focus for a long period of time. But when I followed this instruction of yours, to acquire blessings, I found that not only chanting improved but many obstacles I was able to fight. That\u0027s when I had a slight understanding of the import of being the servant of the servant of the servant.\n \n You are so caring and accommodating. Once when one devotee was contemplating drowning in the Arabian Sea and he didn\u0027t tell you, you came from your room, straight to him, whispered in his ear just the words \"I need you\", and went back. This left the devotee spellbound and he happily reverted his decision. You were there for HG Stoka Krishna Prabhu when he needed you the most.\n \n Presently I am serving in Kharagpur. We are engaged in preaching to the first years under the guidance of HG Mukund Lila Prabhu. Also, we are trying to carry out research in the field of consciousness and trying to glorify Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam.\n \n We pray at your lotus feet for strength in performing our devotional service - to carry them out with the highest principles of integrity, in the mood of being servant of servant of servant, with loyalty and chastity to the teachings of Srila Prabhupada and with the mood to assist Srila Prabhupada\u0027s disciples. We also pray at your lotus feet to protect us, guide us, chastise us, whatever it takes to keep us going strong on the path of Krishna consciousness - let all material and separatist desires get vanquished by your instructions, and we assist Srila Prabhupada and his exalted followers in this mission. Kindly give us strength that we may follow in the footsteps of your exalted followers.\n \n Thank you so much Maharaja for everything you have given us. Please give us strength so that we take up more services as we go ahead.}}\n Your lowly, insignificant servant\n Harshit"

Guru Maharaj, you are changing me as a person, you are changing my desires, and giving me a vision to see this world and all relationships within it. My journey with you started through the \"Journey Home\" book, which had such a profound impact on my heart, as if I had been searching for your shelter for so long.\nLike a mother feeds an infant, you are nourishing me daily with your vani, with the devotees\u0027 association I have got, and with the love I am experiencing amongst devotees, which is actually your love coming through them. Thank you, Guru Maharaj, for giving shelter of Radha Gopinath to this struggling soul. You have accepted me as I am. By your mercy, you allow me to be part of your yatras, where I can really relish Krishna consciousness. Like a loving father, you take care of all the details, but most importantly, you give us Krishna. You dive deeper into our consciousness and make us cry and long for Krishna, to call out for His mercy. I feel so grateful and secure in your shelter. I am so far from Krishna, but you have held my hands so tightly and are daily encouraging me to walk towards Him. Guru Maharaj, you are so absorbed in Vrindavan consciousness that it has manifested through your heart as GEV and Radha Gopinath temple. You are my treasure, Guru Maharaj, given to me by Shrila Prabhupada. You have given and taught me so much: the loving, intimate, and selfless dealings among devotees, the culture of hearing and chanting, the mood to always remain a servant of others, and to only long and pray for pure love, for pure devotional service. This is so rare, and by some divine causeless mercy, I have got this rare fortune to be connected to you, to belong to you. What more can I pray for? I have got the touchstone. My only desire is that I may become a medium to give pleasure to you, to serve you with my life and soul.\nOn this auspicious day of your divine appearance, I want to seek your blessings.\nGurudev, give me the strength to practice your teachings in my life, even if they seem very heavy, even if they seem impossible in my current state of consciousness. Give me the longing to desire to make your desire my own. Give me the patience to accept myself with my conditioning and tolerate others with their conditioning.\nGive me the strength to practice in my character the ideals you hold so sacred, which by your loving compassion you are teaching me through your words and actions.\nI don\u0027t deserve to be called your disciple if I don\u0027t strive to practice what you teach me. I have a lot of conditioning, a lot of ulterior desires, but I know they don\u0027t define me. I am your daughter and will eternally be. That is the truth.\nSo, Guru Maharaj, change me, change my desires, and let me only long for pure devotional service. Make me hanker to serve others, to pray for them before I do for myself, to think of their spiritual growth before mine, to love without expecting, to live with gratitude, a life of surrender to your lotus feet, and use my life and make me an instrument to preach the glories of the holy name to everyone.\nI know I am very far, but I know you have been holding my hands for so long and will keep doing that. Just don\u0027t let me leave those hands which have fed me, nourished me, and patted my back whenever I have fallen. You have been the witness of all my lows, of all my anarthas no one knows about, still, you have not left me. This is true love.\nGurudev, make me like this: to love everyone without judging.\nI am trying and struggling daily with the hope that you, Shrila Prabhupada, and my beloved Radha Gopinath will be proud and very pleased with my struggles one day. With that hope that I am yours, I am not an orphan. I belong to you; give me the strength to practice what you have taught for my whole life and for eternity.\nThank you, Guru Maharaj.\nI am forever yours!\n\nYour daughter,\nHarshita"

You explained that Krishna bends in every direction to show His love, without calculation, without expectation. When hearing this, I immediately thought of you, Gurumaharaj. Just as Krishna opens His heart to His devotees, you open our hearts to Krishna. Through your compassion, your instructions, and your unwavering humility, you prepare us to receive transcendental knowledge and reconnect us to our eternal Father—without ever asking anything in return.\n Your recent visit to Farmington Hills was another living example of your boundless kindness. Despite your own illness and physical difficulties, you showered blessings on everyone. You accepted the simple brown rice with gratitude, appreciated the reading of Chaitanya Charitamrita during your meal, and took time to smile, encourage, and uplift every single devotee. Nothing goes unnoticed by you. Your heart is always absorbed in wanting the best for everyone, and your presence transforms ordinary moments into sacred opportunities for service. You teach us what it means to live with gratitude, humility, and unwavering devotion. You teach us how a true servant-leader lives—with gentleness, gratitude, and unshakeable devotion.\n People often think tears come only from pain, but with you, Gurumaharaj, it is on an inconceivable platform. Whenever I remember your grace or hear your classes, something in my heart begins to churn, and tears start flowing uncontrollably—not out of sorrow, but from the awakening of something pure that only your mercy can touch. These tears are my greatest treasure. They are the highlight of every moment I meet you, hear you, or even think of you. Thank you for every glance, every smile, every lecture—each one drawing me closer to you and to Krishna completely and unconditionally.\n On this sacred day of your Vyas Puja, I pray at your lotus feet for the strength to remain loyal, sincere, and serious in my practice of Krishna consciousness. Please bless me that I may always remember your instructions and serve in a way that brings even a small amount of joy to your heart. Gurumaharaj, thank you for loving us far beyond what we deserve.

When I came to Radhagopinath, I was mesmerized by the beauty of devotees\u0027 love and care, and after attending a couple of Sunday feasts, one of my friends told me the very first story about you – how you take care of each one of us. It was the initial days of the yatra, and you took devotees to Vrindavan for the yatra. Everyone wanted to visit the hill where you used to live, and you knew the path was thorny, so you told everyone to stay behind, and you went ahead and cleared all the thorns with your foot so that everyone could walk comfortably. And no one knew until Vishakha Mataji saw your bleeding feet, and you told her not to mention it to anyone. When I heard this story for the first time, I was in shock. How can anyone be so selfless? And also, I understand where all the love and care of devotees are coming from. How all the energy comes from the sun to the earth, similarly, you are the source of all the love and selflessness in the devotees. Gurudev, we are really very grateful for everything you have done for us. Even though I am not qualified, I still pray that one day I can be a reason for your smile.

        "Your Offering ":  "oṁ ajñāna-timirāndhasya jñānāñjana-śalākayā\n cakṣur unmīlitaṁ yena tasmai śrī-gurave namaḥ\n \n Dearest Gurudeva,\n \n My heartfelt obeisances at your extraordinarily merciful lotus feet. Glories to Srila Prabhupada and his army of stalwart soldiers like yourself who are absolutely unreal. Majestic.\n \n This year I find myself meditating on the meaning of \"lotus feet\". We read and hear about it so much and it is used so casually; it\u0027s a pet peeve to hear it being used loosely in conversation. A lotus, growing in the muck, rises gracefully and blooms, then sinks silently in the gloom, day after day. Its fragrance unaffected, its beauty unrestricted. The putrid slime rolls off it every dawn, the untainted, delicate wonder of nature. Its roots grow deep and hold the lotus strong—in that murky mess! Oh, why does the lotus not find another home, more suited to match its simple, pure self? Rather, it anchors itself there, thriving, serving to purify the water and soil from excess nutrients and pollutants. It contributes in such a phenomenal way—by being there simply, and adding color and loveliness in an otherwise seemingly unattractive space. Isn\u0027t this how you have led your life from your very childhood? You have seen the world, Srila Gurudeva, the great, terrible, and repulsive. The upside-down rainbow of your smile...so innocently charming and unlimitedly compassionate. You\u0027re that lotus, dearest Gurudeva.\n \n And your feet have traversed no-man\u0027s lands and badlands and lands that take away all the bads, the dhams. A man goes where his feet take him, and yours have been invariably attracted to śrī rūpa mañjarī pada. You have put your unshakable faith and sought shelter in the line of impeccable ācāryas, and that very same sanctuary you have come to transparently extend to us here. Mind-bogglingly unfathomable, yet an irrevocable fact. Each word of the Guru Vandana prayer rings true, and when I can sing, it is a window into Srila Prabhupada\u0027s place in your heart and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur\u0027s place in the heart of Srila Prabhupada and so on. Yours ARE lotus feet, dearest Gurudeva. I may never conceive the full meaning, though I say with absolute certainty that it is the most freeing truth. I pray to tightly grasp onto it and keep it close to my heart forever.\n ----\n Over five millennia ago, our sweet Lord brought the Vrajavasis to Govardhan for seven days and nights. You also manifested a Yatra that brought us all together, from different corners of the world, for seven days and nights. All our eyes were on the look-out for you, searching, or on you whenever the opportunity would present itself. And you\u0027d reciprocate with us all appropriately, like our sweet Lord did with the Vrajavasis. We\u0027ve prayed deeply together and danced ecstatically in your offerings of kirtan. You have thoughtfully, prayerfully, and lovingly manifested the Govardhan Ecovillage as a service to our beloved Srila Prabhupada, the service from which I\u0027m certain without a doubt, the universes are benefitting! HG Baladeva Prabhu had shared how the Yatra happening at Govardhan was nothing short of \"amazing,\" beginning with it being a long-standing desire of yours. My tiny heart had also been pining for that place with so much personality...and you\u0027re truly a desire tree. I\u0027m reflecting on the Yatra that was, and it is bittersweet; I have such a longing to be back there...in the association of remarkable devotees from across the globe. Such a dream! Like bees drawn to the lotus—YOU drew us to you, sweetest Gurudeva.\n \n To mark your diamond jubilee, my kind senior Godbrothers have made romantic efforts like doing a 75-day glorification countdown to your appearance day, and also 75 lessons to be learned from your life as cited in your autobiography, The Journey Home. All this, to please you of course, and more so to uplift those like myself who are incapable of even scratching the surface of the deep mysteries of your unbelievable magnanimity and spotless character. On this most auspicious and holiest of all days, I celebrate you with a prayerful, gratitude-filled heart. I gleefully rejoice that though you are not of this world, you have appeared at a time when I came to attend to some \"unfinished business\" on this planet—and by some stroke of luck, mostly your deep concern for aimlessly floating jiva-baddhas like myself, you have showered your benevolent glance at me and accepted me. To me, you\u0027re that treasure that has no bounds. I pray for your good health so you may continue to touch thousands upon thousands with your bottomless compassion and unmatched humility. I pray that I may get the eyes to appreciate a droplet of the love and dedication that you have for serving Srila Prabhupada in the mood of *dāsa-anudāsānudāsa* eternally, and that I may experience even a fraction of that dedication towards you.\n \n Your servant and daughter,\n Hladini-gopika devi dasi\n New Remuna Dhama\n ISKCON Toronto"

Please shower Your mercy on this unfortunate soul who, thanks to knowledge, which she has received from devotees, she understands what is really important in life. But I am so unfortunate that I have no attachment to the holy names. It is very difficult for me to practice.

And I\u0027m trying to surrender 🙏🙏🙏\nShree Krsn sent me a lot of such highly respected Vaishnavas to give me an example and to help me. Thanks to their prayers, I feel something changing in me, in my life.\n\nThank you, dear and respected Gurudev, for being 🙏\n\nThank you for all. I am unworthy to even look at You, let alone come near You. But I beg Your mercy to give me spiritual refuge🙏🙏🙏\n\nI pray that Bhagwan will protect You, give You good health, strength, and inspiration to continue Your service🙏 I am infinitely grateful to Srila Prabhupada for coming to the West at such a tender age to save us souls mired in ignorance and giving us knowledge🙏🙏🙏\n\nJay Shrila Prabhupad\nJay Shree Radha Madan Mohan\nJay Shree Shree Shree Jagannat Baldev Subhadra\nJay Laddu Gopal Ji\nJay Shree Gaur Nitay\nJay Shree Nrisimhadev\n\nAll glory to Vaishnavas\nAll glory to Guru and Gauranga\n\nRadhe Radhe🙏🙏🙏"

I feel immense gratitude to seek the shelter of your lotus feet and will always aspire to be a particle of dust on your lotus feet. It is only through your immense, unconditional mercy that I am getting the association of so many exalted devotees, which is helping me improve day by day in my spiritual life. I have no attraction for the holy name, nor to study the spiritual scriptures, but your mercy has provided me the chance of serving devotees who are diving in the deep sea of the holy name and standing on the strong siddhanta given by \u0027Bhagavad Gita\u0027, \u0027Srimad Bhagavatam\u0027, and \u0027Chaitanya Charitamrita\u0027. This has helped me to read these scriptures, and I feel so amazed that earlier in my life, I was trying to understand scriptures with no sanga. It was so futile. I kept reading without any understanding, but since the time I came into sanga, reading scriptures has been accompanied by realizations in life. But without your unconditional mercy in the form of sanga of devotees, this was impossible for an insignificant soul like me. It is only through this mercy of yours which has provided me the sanga of my wife, to whom you have given the shelter of your lotus feet. My heart will always be filled with gratitude for your unconditional mercy.\n \nUnconditional love provided by you, by providing your personal association in \u0027Kartik Yatra\u0027, is immeasurable. Your presence in the morning to chant with devotees enriches us so much that it gives goosebumps thinking about it. This immense and immeasurable love pours out in the evening classes during the yatra, where you just want to give to us without stopping. Guru Maharaj, whenever you are giving your presence to the devotees, I always want to give you a flower which I myself have plucked especially for you, though I have done it only in my thoughts. But I still aspire to present you with a fresh, fragrant flower for your long life.\n \n I beg forgiveness at your lotus feet for not having been able to serve Srila Prabhupada, you, and the Vaishnavas to my full capacity. But I have no capacity nor qualification to serve, but your unconditional mercy can only infuse me with enthusiasm, determination, and patience, for which I aspire on this sublime but yet difficult path.\n \n Your humble servant"

        "Your Offering ":  "My Dear Maharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nSince the time you came into my life, I have understood why it is said that the Guru is Krishna Himself. When Srila Prabhupada teaches us, he explains that we cannot see Krishna with our material eyes. And now I understand—out of His mercy, Krishna sends the Guru into our lives so that through the Guru we can feel His presence. Still, even then, we are not able to truly see you as you really are, but whatever little we can perceive is only by Krishna’s kindness upon us.\nThat is when I realized why the Guru is said to be Krishna. Earlier, I could not understand this—I just accepted it out of respect but never felt it deeply. Now I feel it—Guru is Krishna, and you are my Krishna.\nI’m sorry, Maharaj, but when I feel for you, I even understand the real meaning of some Bollywood songs—for example, “Tera mujhse hai pehle naata koi, yun hi nahi dil lubhata koi.” 😅\nYour appearance day is very special for all of us. Thank you so much for coming into my life. I never imagined that I would ever believe in all this, but when I experienced it, I realized—it is pure magic.\nYou have showered so much mercy on me, Maharaj—more than I could ever expect. You have given me far beyond what I deserve—like putting a diamond in the hands of a beggar.\nNow it is my turn, Maharaj. Please bless me so that I can somehow pay back your mercy by walking on your path, always respecting you and everyone else, becoming a good person, and practicing bhakti sincerely. I am not able to do much on my own, but with your help, I know I can.\nI often think to myself—will I ever be able to repay the mercy that you, Srila Prabhupada, and Krishna have given me? Will I ever be able to practice bhakti properly? Sometimes I worry—what if I make some mistake?\nMy mentor once told me that anyone who comes to bhakti, anyone who comes close to Krishna—even if they get distracted or go far away—eventually returns. Krishna Himself brings them back. And because people say that the Guru is Krishna Himself, I feel the same about you. If I ever wander away or become weak, you will bring me back to the right path, won’t you? You won’t let me get lost, right? You will bring me back to you, back to the path of bhakti.\nI know I trouble you a lot with my prayers and persistence, but what can I do—nothing happens without your mercy.\nMaharaj, I sincerely pray that Krishna blesses you with strong health, long life, and unlimited protection. So many people receive mercy, guidance, and hope because of you—including a sinful and fallen person like me. Please stay healthy and strong so that countless souls can continue to receive your compassion. May Krishna always keep you under His divine shelter and give you every strength and comfort.\nWith all my heart,\nYour servant"

May your merciful self continue to extend your shelter to hundreds and millions of hopeless souls like my undeserving self. It appeared as the greatest fortune of my life when you accepted me as a menial servant of your servants, as your unworthy disciple. I shall eternally remain indebted for your kindness, Guru Maharaj.\n\nLast year, on December 27th, after years of waiting, out of your causeless love and compassion, you finally accepted me as a servant. I wish to treasure that day, that moment, forever in the core of my heart. That day, I faced you for the first time ever. I bowed down, hesitant to look right into your eyes, and I offered my vows. While I am sure that you were all cognizant of my wretched, undeserving condition, you extended your hand to bless me with your chanted beads, while HG Radheshyam Prabhu announced my new name - Isvara Mukunda Das. You have always been as worshipable as Bhagavan for me, Guru Maharaj, and HG Radheshyam Prabhu has always been my shiksha guru, the life force in my sadhana bhakti. Nothing could have been more fortunate than to get initiation from you in his presence.\n\nFrom that day on, I am always restless. Your merciful self and my shiksha guru have done such a great favor on me. What do I do to reciprocate? How do I satisfy you? How do I express my love and gratitude to you, Guru Maharaj? My mind is always questioning my servitude to you. I am chanting. I am reading. I am hearing. I am serving with devotees. I am preaching. Everything is an offering for your pleasure, but I lack contentment. After trying to convince me with several philosophical arguments, I am still striving to offer something tangible to satisfy you, Guru Maharaj. Indeed, a serious lack of sincerity and personal purity are undeniable causes for the same.\n\nA child’s innocence remains protected in its dependence upon the father. To please you also, I am utterly dependent upon your kindness. On this blessed day, I beg for the ability and sincerity to serve you, to please you, to satisfy you. I pray at your lotus feet, Guru Maharaj, that no distraction or disturbance may take me away from the association of your sincere servants. Let me remain loyal to your command, my master! Let me be able to fight my own conditionings and lower self with sincerity in sewa and sadhana! Let me never become forgetful of your ultimate kindness upon my lowly self. Let me never bring any disgrace to your glory or ever discourage devotees with my immaturity in dealings and personal conduct. Please protect me from shadowy motivations, Guru Maharaj. Often, the hidden lust for power, recognition, and prestige takes the garb of devotional service. May your divine example and pure teachings be my guiding light across all these dark lanes.\n\nIf it pleases you, dear Guru Maharaj, I beg for the shelter at your lotus feet life after life. Not as a parasite but as an obedient, unpretentious servant of your servants.\n\nOnce again, sincerest prayers for your health, Guru Maharaj. It is true that bodily discomforts do not affect your transcendental self, but it does pain your servants to see you go through any external health challenges just to keep us all motivated. May Sri Sri Radha Vrindavanbihari Ji bestow all of us with your merciful, ecstatic presence for eternity!\n\nYour Unworthy Servant,\nIsvara Mukunda Das"

Please bestow your mercy to overcome this quality of finding faults in others, which is a sign of my own impurities.\n \n Your quote says: “The greatest charity we can give is an excellent example for others to follow.”\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, you always set the greatest example for all of us. By having your darshan, one can immediately become humble. Your folded hands show respect to others, and your simplicity in not expecting any respect from others, as Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu prays: “Trinad api sunicena.”\n \n Guru Maharaj, I am begging for your mercy to follow your instructions and to follow the regulative principles and my obligation to be a ‘dasi’. To sincerely and honestly try to imbibe this spirit, as you said, then Krsna will reciprocate by cleansing our hearts and minds to hear His glories and chant His names.\n \n Thank you very much. \n \n Your servant of servant of servant,\n Isvari Kumari Devi Dasi"

Sometimes we manage to seize the day and remain dedicated to the mission of Srila Prabhupada, but most often, covered by the illusory energy, we allow time to steal from us the precious moments of Krishna consciousness.\n \n It feels as if yesterday was last year’s Vyasa-puja, when we prayed for health, mercy, and love for our most beloved Gurudev.\n \n Meanwhile, a lot of water has passed through Mother Ganga, and many events have passed through our lives as well. The question of whether we have been better than last year, and whether we are becoming more firmly grounded in Krishna consciousness, will hover constantly — chasing us just as time mercilessly pushes us toward yet another old age, toward yet another departure from this body…\n \n The only light in these conditioned lives of ours — in which we mostly struggle with our own selves — is you, dear Gurudev. Our last meeting with you has kept me for long in an euphoric, transcendental mood. But as time that terrible enemy of the devotees passes, the memories slowly fade, and with them the energy we captured from your presence.\n \n The new times we live in have taken a lot from us, but also have given us a lot. They have given us the opportunity to always be online with you, to hear your transcendental talks, through which again and again you bring us back to the right path — the path toward home, a path on which without your guidance we cannot go far.\n \n Just as Krishna’s calves unconditionally followed Krishna through good and bad, fulfilling all His instructions, so I, the most fallen of your disciples, try to follow your instructions and try to steal at least a small smile of satisfaction from you. The reward of Krishna’s calves for their service is eternal; time can do nothing to them, and again and again — untouched by forgetfulness — they delight in loving service to Krishna. Immersed in their pure love for their Govinda, they receive the mercy to be far from duality, change, and the fleeting nature of this miserable material world.\n \n Happy that I have you as my guiding Vaikuntha star, I celebrate this auspicious day — Vyasa-puja, because for me, Gurudev, you are my Krishna; you are the only light that protects me in the darkness of Kali-yuga and the burdens of everyday material life. Continue to lead us, help us, and be our guide on this unique journey home. Without you we are lost, condemned to defeat by the illusory energy.\n \n I wish you everything that can be wished for the dearest person in this life — love, service, best disciples, companionship with Krishna, health, and the eternal smile on your beautiful face that again and again gives us strength and energy to remain in Krishna consciousness.\n \n Please protect and guide us in the best way you know and can. For me, all that remains is to give my life to this beautiful mission of Srila Prabhupada and to pray again and again for eternal service to you, dear Gurudev, amidst the claws of this material world which only you make transcendental. It does not matter where we may be in service — only keep us within it.\n \n The time is short and precious. I will try to make him my best friend serving your lotus feet.\n I surrender them and rejoice in every new opportunity for service. I once again wish you best on this auspicious day and send all my love to you, dear Gurudev.\n \n Your humble servant,\n Jagajivana dasa"

Your lectures are truly the backbone and foundation of my spiritual life. Your instructions are so lucid, profound, and essential for one’s survival and growth in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Your expressions of gratitude and Your heartfelt presentations of the lives of Your Godbrothers, Godsisters, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and all our ācāryas are filled with such devotion that hearing them feels as if everything is unfolding right before our eyes.\n \n Your descriptions of Śrī Gaurāṅga’s līlā and Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s līlā are simply amazing—deep, sweet, and spiritually elevating. Due to my conditioning, I often fail to relish them with the taste and absorption that they deserve. I pray for Your blessings so that I may develop even 1% of the intensity and sweetness with which You speak about these divine pastimes.\n \n Recently, I have been hearing Your glories from many senior devotees, and with every offering my love, appreciation, respect, and gratitude multiply manyfold. Your care, compassion, sacrifice, love, prayers, and hard work over the decades have given us the priceless gifts of so many senior Godbrothers and Godsisters—my inspirations and role models—such as HG Gauranga Prabhu, HG Radheshyam Prabhu, HG Vraj Bihari Prabhu, HG Radha Gopinath Prabhu, HG Gaur Gopal Prabhu, HG Govinda Prabhu, HG Krishna Anand Prabhu, HG Krishna Chandra Prabhu, HG Anand Vrindavan Prabhu, HG Dwarkadhish Prabhu, HG Vishakha Mataji, HG Krishna Kishore Prabhu, HG Mukund Anand Prabhu, HG Parmeshwari Mataji, HG Bala Govind Prabhu, HG Murari Prabhu, HG Ramanand Prabhu, HG Sri Guru Charan Prabhu, HG Revati Pati Prabhu, HG Ram Nitai Prabhu, HG Sundarshyam Prabhu, HG Chaitanya Charan Prabhu, HG Jahnavi Harrison Mataji, HG Jay Shetty Prabhu, HG Krishna Loka Prabhu, HG Manmohan Shyam Prabhu, and many others.\n \n All of them are such wonderful personalities serving You beautifully in various capacities according to time, place, and circumstance. I feel extremely fortunate to have their association—only because of You, Maharaj.\n \n By Your mercy, I am abundantly blessed with all the basic facilities of life. Yet, I continue to struggle in many areas.\n Right now, my practices—especially my japa—have become very mechanical and of poor quality. This year has been particularly challenging. Every day I resolve to chant with better concentration, with absorption, and without any electronic distractions for at least 2–3 hours, yet I repeatedly fail. My biggest weakness is that I know the problem and I know the solution, but laziness and lethargy hold me back. Please, Gurudev, bless me so that I may overcome these weaknesses and improve in this most essential aspect of spiritual life.\n \n One of the highlights of my year is eagerly waiting for the deep, soul-stirring saṅkīrtana during the Kārtik Yātrā. Your kīrtans are truly out of this world—the way You inspire us to cry out the Holy Names from the heart, forgetting everything of this material world, and dive deeper and deeper into the ocean of nāma. I pray that someday I may chant with even a fraction of the love and absorption You exemplify.\n \n I know I have committed many aparādhas and sins, and I am not qualified to chant in such a pure mood. But I am fully confident that by Your grace I will gradually overcome these obstacles.\n \n Your interactions with Your Godbrothers and Godsisters, Your gratitude, Your consistent appreciation, and Your ability to always see the good qualities in devotees are lessons I cherish deeply. Your broad-mindedness and compassionate heart never judge anyone by externals. You are constantly looking for ways to connect souls to Śrīla Prabhupāda and Their Lordships. This mood is Your continuous meditation.\n \n I pray that I may imbibe even the tiniest fraction of these qualities and become a sincere, serious devotee without ulterior motives.\n \n On the professional front, by Your grace things are improving, though there is still a long journey ahead. We hope to establish ourselves as a leading brand in Luxury Sacred Trips—offering every client a devotional and fulfilling experience.\n On the personal front, many challenges remain, but things are improving. I pray that, by Kṛṣṇa’s grace and Your blessings, these obstacles disappear so I can fully focus on the three topmost priorities of my life.\n \n On this most auspicious day of Your Vyāsa-pūjā, I beg for Your forgiveness and Your blessings. May I truly become the disciple You want me to be and follow the vows I have taken before You until my last breath.\n \n Thank You once again, Gurudev.\n Your insignificant servant of Your servants,\n Jagannath Dham Das\n Pune"

Through your lectures, you teach us how to remain Krishna conscious in this material world, how to connect ourselves with Krishna, and how to develop pure love for Lord Krishna.\nDuring the Kartik Yatra, in one of your lectures, you said that we have all come to Vrindavan to beg for devotion. These words touched my heart deeply.\nSenior devotees have told us how deeply you think about everything and how profound your observation is. On the day of Govardhan Puja during the yatra, we experienced this personally.\nMaharaj, the kirtans you lead during the yatra — there are simply no words to describe them! It feels as if they should never end, just like rasgullas prepared during the yatra — you wish they would last forever!\nOnce again, I feel indebted to our Guru Parampara and to Lord Sri Krishna for giving me a Guru Maharaj like you.\nHare Krishna.

I heard your first lecture and enthusiastic kirtan. Maharaj ji, at that time, I had just come from my native place and was a fresher in the city of Mumbai.

These auspicious beginnings I cannot forget.\n During the katha in those days, I used to offer you Vyajanam, as it was an allowed practice at that time.\n I remember the time when my eternal counselor HG Mahaprabhu ji introduced me to you, but the way you smiled and said, \"I have known him for a long time,\" made me feel that you knew me from my previous life. Maharaji, I may not be a strong devotee, but it is sufficient for me that you have known me for a long time.\n Maharaj ji, I am still struggling with my lethargic habits. Kindly keep your merciful glance upon me, for which I am starving.\n I promise you that one day I will prove myself to be worthy of your disciple.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Jai Hari Das and Ujwala Gopika DD and family 🙏 🙏"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Maharaj, your divine appearance day celebration this year is very special and historical.\n This year began with the historical celebration of Maha Kumbha Mela which appeared after 144 years, occurring only once in our lifetime.\n \n This year also marked the 60th anniversary of the historical event of Srila Prabhupada boarding Jaladuta and leaving for the West for creating a worldwide revolution, which is occurring only once in our lifetime.\n \n This year is ending with the historical celebration of the 75th divine appearance day of your holiness who left the Western world to assist Srila Prabhupada in his worldwide revolution, which is occurring only once in our lifetime.\n \n Maharaj, this confluence of Triveni Sangam itself is happening once in our lifetime, and hence we are unlimitedly fortunate and blessed to witness these events unfolding together in our lifetime.\n \n As per the Samvatsar calendar, which has a cycle of 60 years, this year is the same year when Srila Prabhupada boarded the Jaladuta. In the historical year of 1965, when Srila Prabhupada boarded the Jaladuta, the Samvatsar year was “Vishvavasu”. The same Samvatsar “Vishvavasu” has come again this year in 2025 after 60 years. Hence, as per the Samvatsar, this year is the first anniversary of the historical event of Srila Prabhupada boarding Jaladuta, which will indeed be the only anniversary for us in our lifetime.\n \n Srila Prabhupada travelled in different countries across the world as a cultural ambassador with a message of world peace and global unity. Continuing Srila Prabhupada’s legacy, over these decades you have offered your unparalleled contribution in expanding Srila Prabhupada’s message of world peace and global unity across the world.\n \n At a young age of 17, you left the comforts of the Western world with practically no money and resources and hitchhiked to India, risking your life in search of God. In India, you lived a life of a monk and dedicated your life to the welfare of society, as you had promised to the guard while requesting him to allow you to enter the borders of India.\n \n While we are fortunate to be blessed by your holy association, we would like to seek this opportunity to assist you in humbly offering our insignificant contribution at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Dear Maharaj, on the occasion of your 75th appearance day, this fallen soul humbly seeks your blessings and begs for your causeless mercy so that we can at least try to offer our insignificant contribution in your service to spread the message of world peace and global unity. While praying for your blessings, we very well know that the contribution which we are trying to offer you is nothing compared to the contribution you have made to the world in service to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Maharaj, when you came to India for a higher cause, you were alone; we are many. You were penniless; we are earning. You had no place to reside; we have our homes. You physically endured hardships travelling across the world; the world for us is just a click away. Yes, Maharaj, today, with the advancement of technology, we have all comforts and luxuries to assist you in offering our contribution of taking Srila Prabhupada’s message across the world, still our contribution is insignificant because although:\n \n - We do have all the comforts of reaching out to the world from our homes, but we don’t have the compassion which you give to the world in service to Srila Prabhupada.\n - We do have all the luxuries to connect with people through technology, but we don’t have the love with which you connect with people across the world in service to Srila Prabhupada.\n - We do have all the facilities to take Srila Prabhupada’s message across the world, but we don’t have the faith you have in your Guru’s instruction to spread his message across the world.\n \n Maharaj, we have nothing to offer you. We only have Srila Prabhupada’s words in the form of his prayer which we can offer you so that if we receive your causeless mercy then we can at least hope to have some qualification so that we can have something to offer to the world. I don’t have the qualification to offer prayers directly to the Lord, but by your causeless mercy, I know I can offer you Srila Prabhupada’s prayers which he offered to the Lord just before he created a worldwide revolution.\n \n Maharaj, I humbly beg for your causeless mercy so that we can try to assist you in offering our insignificant contribution of taking Srila Prabhupada’s message of world peace and global unity to the world.\n \n I know your causeless mercy can make everything possible because you are the most expert mystic. I am very unfortunate, unqualified, and the most fallen. Therefore, I am seeking your benediction so that I can convince them, for I am powerless to do so on my own.\n \n tabe jadi taba kripâ hoy ahaitukî\n sakala-i sambhava hoy tumi se kautukî\n kshudra âmi dîna hîna kono s\u0027akti nâhi\n \n I don’t have any power and qualification on my own. However, my only qualification is that I want to try to give my best to fulfill your instruction to assist you in your service to Srila Prabhupada.\n O my Master, I am just like a puppet in your hands. So, if you have asked me to dance, then make me dance, make me dance, O my Master, make me dance as you like.\n \n âniyâcho jadi prabhu âmâre nâcâte\n nâcâo nâcâo prabhu nâcâo se-mate\n kâshthera puttali jathâ nâcâo se-mate\n An insignificant puppet begging for your causeless mercy,\n Jaigopal das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaja,\nIn one of Raghunatha Dasa Gosvami’s most extolled prayers to his Guru Maharaja, he says,\nnama-srestham manum api saci-putram atra svarupam\nRupam tasyagrajam uru-purim mathurim gostavatim\nRadha-kundam giri-varam aho radhika-madhavasam\nprapto yasya prathita-krpaya sri gurum tam nato’ smi\n“I am fully indebted to Sri Gurudeva. Why? He has given me a profound conception of the holy name of Krishna which\ncontains the phenomenal sound which contains the highest form of thought, aspiration, ideal, and everything. The name\nKrishna is enchanting and most sensational—the sum and substance of everything.\n\nAnd then he says, “He has given me service of that great radiant savior, the son of mother Saci, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu\nwho is like a golden mountain standing and magnanimously emphasizing the stupendous lilas of Radha and Krishna. And\nGurudeva has brought me to the lotus feet of Mahaprabhu’s most intimate assistant, Svarupa Damodara, who is the\nrepresentation of Lalita devi, who is the most favorite friend of Radhika.\n\nThen he has got me in connection with Sri Rupa, who was ordered to distribute the most fascinating kinds of devotional rasas—\nRaganuga bhakti. Raghunatha Dasa Gosvami further says, then by his grace I have achieved the association of Srila Sanatana Gosvami\nwho adjusts our position in relation to raganuga bhakti and gives us ‘Sambandha jnana.’\n\nThen he says, “Gurudeva has given me Mathura Mandala where Radha and Govinda have Their most intimate, loving, and most sweet\npastimes. Everything animate and inanimate helps me in my remembrance of Radha and Govinda. All this I have received from my\nGurudeva. By living in Vrindavana with the Vrajavasis, I am becoming acquainted with their association and their feelings of love for\nKrishna. By the grace of Gurudeva, I have become acquainted with Radha Kund, the favorite place of Radha and Govinda for their\nmost intimate pastimes, and this great Govardhana. He has given me hope that one day I can eternally render Them service, so\nI bow my head with all my respects to the lotus feet of my Gurudeva.”\n\nSo, if we are conscious of all these spiritual masters, then we have approached our Gurudeva properly.\nKrishna says, “Those who try to worship Me directly are not real devotees. Real devotees are those who are devoted to My devotees.\nWe can see Mount Everest from afar. But to approach Mount Everest, we must pass through so many closer mountain peaks.\nSo when we say that our connection is with Krishna alone, then we are far off.\nIf we are to actually approach the king, we must approach him through his entourage.\n\nSo, Guru is the divine messenger of immortal hope and joy in this mortal and miserable world. His advent is the most auspicious and\nhappy event.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Sri Rupa and Raghunatha Dasa and the previous acharyas, he is persistently revealing to us the holy\nabode of the Lord and His most loving pastimes with His devotees. We all perceived this during our Govardhana yatra this time.\nIn the Srimad Bhagavatam are beautiful prayers which say that, “The devotee whose heart has been completely cleansed by the process\nof devotional service and who is favored by bhakti devi does not become bewildered by the external energy of the Lord, which is like a\ndeep, dark well. Being completely cleansed of all material contaminations in this way, he is very easily able\nto understand Your pastimes. I therefore beg Your Lordship to bless me by the association of Your devotees who are completely purified\nby worshiping Your lotus feet and are so merciful and compassionate on the fallen conditioned souls. I think that Your real benediction\nwill be to allow me to associate with such devotees.\n\nDear Gurudeva, please allow me to be the servant of the servant of Your devotees.\nThank you very much.\nHis Holiness Radhanatha Swami ki jay!\nJagad guru Srila Prabhupada ki jay!"

One of my relatives who recently saw you giving class for several hours sitting erect was shocked to see a 75-year-old man, how can he sit in the same position for several hours. That is one of the examples of your discipline.\nGurudev, as we know and you have also spoken this many times that your nature is like a Bhajananandi, but I see you giving class for several hours and speaking to devotees for a long time, which is an example of Gosthanandi. Guru Maharaj, how you changed your nature is difficult to conceptualize for me. Just to please your Gurudev, you have changed your psychophysical nature, which is really very difficult.\nGurudev, I feel if I\u0027ll be able to follow even one drop of what you are doing for your Guru, I can also try to please you.\nOn your 75th Vyas Pooja Guru Maharaj, I have taken some commitment to pray for your better health.

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Maharaja,\n Please accept my humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet.\n \n All glories to Srila Prabhupada and all glories to your holiness for everything in my life.\n I have written Vyasa Puja Offerings for Srila Prabhupada only till now, but this is the first time I am writing a Vyasa Puja offering for you, Maharaja.\n \n I am unworthy and not qualified at all to write this, but for my own purification and for Krishna’s pleasure, I will try in this humble attempt.\n It’s my great good fortune that by the supreme divine grace of Srila Prabhupada and his followers, I came in contact with Krishna Consciousness 4 years ago. I was speedily heading towards a hellish and goal-less society filled with just artificial living and the essence of life based on simply sense enjoyment, either gross or subtle. I had no clue of what life really means; what is the human form of life meant to offer? Is life just meant for enjoyment, but that enjoyment is filled with enormous suffering, so what this life has to offer to me? Even we don’t realize that enjoyment is packaged with suffering; that is the depth of ignorance under which we are buried. Who is Bhagawan or Krishna and what does he have to give and take in this world? What is the essence of all the great scriptures of the world, and what is the essence for which all the saintly persons are living? I didn’t even question these basic, constitutional, and foundational things.\n \n But Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda had amazingly astonishing plans for me. They somehow sent devotees, or by their causeless mercy, I met those devotees who entered inside me like a needle and became like a plough, ploughing and digging and uprooting my deep ignorance from my stoned heart and planting the most beautiful and the ultimate essence of entire creation – Kṛṣṇa – The Supreme Personality of Godhead. And by the divine unlimited blessings of Srila Prabhupada and all acaryas, I got the best of the spiritual opulence in my life, although I was not qualified at all, and even today, I’m not truly grateful deep inside. I got the association of devotees for which all the great personalities from our scriptures, like Lord Brahma, Narada, and Siva, even aspire. It’s the same date, 15-11-2021 4 years exactly from today, that I started staying for the first time with devotees. I soon realized how in the world people can be like them. What nectarine words are coming from their mouths, what strong character and values they hold, and how truly they just want to love Krishna and share that love with others and love all the jivas, all the parts and parcels of Krishna. I was just mesmerized by their loving compassion and care.\n \n I got the best of the training, guidance, care, and empowerment staying in our VOICE Centre in Varanasi. I am truly grateful from my heart to you, Maharaja, and following your footsteps, HG Radheshyam Prabhu started this initiative of VOICE. I am eternally grateful to HG Acyuta Mohan Prabhu for creating such wonderful VOICE Centres in Varanasi. I am extremely grateful to HG Apurva Gopal Prabhu who allowed me to stay in that VOICE even though I was most unqualified. I just wish I could again join back those days and absorb myself, which I was not able to do in those days being very inattentive and lazy. I got every best possible spiritual opulence – such genuine, caring devotee friends, loving seniors, amazing Yatras, wonderful opportunities to serve, delicious prasadam, and everyday being a feast starting with dancing in Mangala Aarati.\n \n And the most auspicious and fortunate thing I got to receive there was you, Maharaja – the journey of your life, about the communities and projects that you have offered in service to Srila Prabhupada, your heartfelt lectures filled with your love towards Krishna, your soul-enlivening Kirtans, and also your amazing disciples.\n After I graduated from VOICE, I could make sense of how fortunate I was being allowed to stay there.\n \n So, Maharaja, definitely words would fall short in glorifying you for everything that you have graced upon us. Whenever I really feel down in my Bhakti life, I tune to your lecture and immediately I find an answer, and I get the very specific thing that I was looking for. There are thousands and thousands of lectures that you have spoken to train us to love Krishna, to train us how not to fall prey to Maya, to train us how rare Bhakti is, to train us how to truly reciprocate to Srila Prabhupada’s mercy, to train us what a Vaisnava means, to train us how to act or respond to situations in our life, to train us “What does Vaisnava seva means and how that’s the essence of Bhakti,” to train us what humility is. You keep reminding us the Siksastaka verse of Trnadapi Sunicena. You keep hammering over this, as you know humility is the only way to attract the mercy of Krishna and our Acaryas. Your lectures are simple yet filled with profound wisdom, filled with love towards Krishna. Your lectures are the natural outpour of the love that you possess in your heart towards Krishna and Srila Prabhupada. I just pray that may I take full advantage of the ever-accessible Vani Seva - your lectures and someday learn to love and serve Krishna and his dear devotees.\n Srila Prabhupada built a house in which the whole world could live, and you, Maharaja, one of the finest jewels in Srila Prabhupada’s army, have beautifully decorated that house and taught us how to do the same.\n \n You taught us how Krishna Consciousness can be super exciting, how everyday can be a festival, how truly to take shelter of holy names of Krishna, how we should come together as a team to offer services, how our every activity should be an offering to Krishna and devotees, how to please the devotees and how not to displease or offend the devotees, how to serve cows, how to dance in Kirtans, how to visit holy dhams and get absorbed in the potency of Dham, and simply how to love Krishna.\n \n I am so grateful to have attended 3 Kartik Yatras till now, and these Yatras are deeply nourishing and feeding the hunger of our souls. We hear that there is everything in the scriptures; the Vedas are Kalpa-tarus, desire-fulfilling trees. We see in Chaitanya Charitamrita how the festivals are celebrated in Lord Chaitanya’s lila, how everyone is just happy serving the Lord and devotees, how everyone is dancing ecstatically to please Lord Krishna, and how everyone is relishing the glories of Dhams and the Lord’s unlimited pastimes and pastime places. I can truly see Chaitanya Charitamrita manifesting in your Yatras, Maharaja, where everyone is just willing to serve and please all the devotees.\n This is what a Person Bhagavatam is who shows by his example what the Book Bhagavatam says, and you are such a rare Person Bhagavatam, Maharaja, who is truly sharing the message of Srila Vyasa Deva in the line of Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Reading your \"Journey Home\" book, Maharaj, was such a faith-giving story to me that how fortunate we are to be in the shelter of Srila Prabhupada. One small realization for me was that how much Maharaja faced troubles in his life traveling from America to India, facing so many hardships, with practically having no penny, risking your life countless times, crossing borders after borders, and finally arriving in the land of India. Even in India, you traveled to so many places like the Himalayas, Varanasi, Rishikesh, Delhi, Bodh Gaya, Patna, Mumbai, and even Nepal in search of your spiritual emancipation, and your search ended at the divine lotus feet of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. You have done all the filtering, you have done all the search, you have done all the quality checks, and you have conclusively said from your story that “Srila Prabhupada ki Jaya.” And it’s very important for us and our conditioned minds to understand that Srila Prabhupada has given us everything, and he is the real Jagad Guru. You have done all the hard work to ease out things for us and give us that faith. From your story, one more thing we can see is how Krishna has personally orchestrated and carved your journey. The way you stopped at Mathura on the day of Janmashtami, the way you had to extend your visa and stay in Vrindavan, the way Krishna saved you from all so-called gurus, and the way Krishna paved your way to surrender unto Srila Prabhupada. Sri Sri Gaur Nitai deeply wanted you to be in their army, and they arranged everything for a 19-year-old boy from America to become a premi Bhakta of Sri Sri Radha Gopinatha.\n \n Thank you so much again, Maharaj, for everything. I pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, Lalita Visakha, Sri Sri Gaur Nitai, Sri Gopal Ji – Your Pranadhana – that may they bless you with the best of health. This world needs you, Maharaja, to expand the glories of Sri Sri Gaur Nitai to every town and village. I just pray to you, Maharaj, that please give me a drop of love that you have towards your Guru Maharaja – Srila Prabhupada and Sri Sri Radha Gopinatha. Please bless me that may I become a humble instrument of compassion in the hands of my superiors and Srila Prabhupada. I am currently rendering some services at Varanasi and Prayagraj under the able guidance of HG Acyuta Mohan Prabhu. May I be able to serve HG Acyuta Mohan Prabhu, HG Radheshyam Prabhu, and you, Maharaja, in expanding the causeless mercy of Srila Prabhupada. I am so grateful to be given an opportunity to assist and serve you and all of them who are tirelessly working to decrease the pain of Krishna and our Acaryas by connecting the Jivas who have turned away from Krishna.\n \n I am extremely grateful to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Mandir secretaries for giving all of us this chance to glorify HH Radhanatha Swami Maharaja personally for his decades of unwavering service to Srila Prabhupada and International Society for Krishna Consciousness.\n \n Also, Maharaja, I pray to you that please accept me, this fallen, lowly servant, as yours. I know that I have no qualification, but by your causeless mercy, I pray that someday you accept me as your disciple. I deeply and sincerely seek your shelter, Maharaja, so that I may fulfill the true purpose of this human form of life.\n Thank you, Srila Gurudeva.\n \n Happy 75th appearance day, Maharaja.\n \n His Holiness Radhanatha Swami Maharaja ki Jaya.\n Srila Prabhupada ki Jaya.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Jayant}}"

All glories to you!\n \n CC Madhya 19.151\n \n ব্রহ্মাণ্ড ভ্রমিতে কোন ভাগ্যবান্ জীব ।\n গুরু-কৃষ্ণ-প্রসাদে পায় ভক্তিলতা-বীজ ॥ ১৫১ ॥\n brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva\n guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja\n \n Translation\n \n “According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. By the mercy of both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.\"\n \n We wander through this world, and by the mercy of the Lord, this world is blessed by the presence of saintly, divine souls — the beloved of the Lord, the beloved of Lord Krishna. Such souls are exceedingly rare and difficult to find, and even more difficult to associate with. They are powerhouses of mercy, kindness, and divine qualities.\n \n How we long to imbibe even a small particle of those qualities — even a small particle of your own divine qualities, dear Gurudev. You walk among us and shower us with all those blessings.\n \n Among your countless beautiful qualities, there is one that shines especially brightly for us: your unlimited mercy. Your mercy manifests in so many ways and in so many forms — each like a precious and incomparable gift.\n \n One of your greatest gifts to us is your time — time granted to you by the Lord, which you so mercifully share with us all. You spend your time connecting us, guiding us, uplifting us.\n \n Your long lectures and teachings, infused with love, care, and compassion, give us life, hope, and knowledge — without which our spiritual journey would be unthinkable. Sometimes, just a few minutes of your time are enough to protect a devotee from the danger of going astray. You never hesitate to walk long distances to visit a disciple in the hospital, or to call and speak with someone in the moment they need you most. The sacrifice of your precious time for our enlightenment is the pinnacle of your mercy.\n \n Even today, we still marvel at the causeless mercy you have shown to us. Although your presence in this world is rare, Krishna allowed our paths to cross, so that ordinary, insignificant, and fallen souls like us could receive a chance — a priceless opportunity. On this auspicious day of your anniversary, we pray that you continue to grant us this chance, and that we may never fail to use it properly.\n \n We pray to hold firmly to your instructions, your love, and your divine lotus feet.\n \n Recently, we heard in one of your lectures that whatever realizations, good qualities, and abilities we possess are not our own; they are lent to us solely for the purpose of helping and serving others. We pray, our beloved Gurudev, that whatever we receive on our spiritual journey may be used wisely, and only for the purpose for which it was intended. \n \n Your servants,\n Bhagavata das \u0026 Jayanti devi dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dearest and respected Gurumaharaj.\n My dear spiritual father, no doubt that you are as close to Krishna as you reciprocate with your disciples in such a way that Krishna does with so many Brijwasis and His devotees. At the same time, He was present with the Gopis, with the cowherd boys, with the mother cows, with other fortunate animals also, and everyone thinks and experiences that Krishna is with them only, and that too fully, not partly. I experienced this and realized that if you can do this, it was definitely done by Srila Prabhupada, and Prabhupada is still doing it with so many devotees by making them realize His presence in different manners. And what to speak of Krishna? We all know, and yet many more are to be revealed by the mercy of the Vaishnavas, Gurumaharaj, and Prabhupada. Gurumaharaj, you are a living form and explanation of humility and humbleness. As we have again witnessed, your qualities and inspirations are transformable; otherwise, one more big event like the Govardhan Kartik Yatra 2025 could create havoc without any police or volunteers to manage. But your disciples are your disciples, and they try to please you by remaining patient, calm, with so much effort that no one was required as a volunteer to prevent anyone from creating noise, propaganda, or any mishap. This was surely your energy, Maharaj, nothing else, which could make 10 to 15,000 devotees sing and dance on the Mahamantra, and that too in sync without any rehearsal or directions. Even though many like me don\u0027t even know how to dance or sing the Mahamantra in the tune you were singing, you only made it. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. My personal experience is, I was not registered for the yatra and was scared about prasadam, stay, and entry, even. As if I didn\u0027t get any of these, my husband would not let me attend. But you and your disciples\u0027 aura are so magnetic that even my husband got stuck into it more than me, and somehow, by your and your disciples\u0027 mercy, everything was arranged so smoothly like butter. It was a miracle for me. You and your disciples are full of mercy. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. I always pray, Gurumaharaj, that you live my years too, because I am not useful, but you are the only hope for many\u0027s faith in devotion. I am sorry, Gurumaharaj, I will never become eligible for your shelter, but I know you can even give me your shelter even on my deathbed also. So I will always try, try, and honestly and strictly try to follow what you say, and that can only make me survive in Bhakti a bit. Since I have joined ISKCON in 2012, I didn\u0027t know anybody except you, not even Prabhupada. So for me, you were only ISKCON, and I got stuck to one of your instructions: \"The more you tolerate, the less you have to.\" And I heartily give my life to this Maharaj. Kindly bless me that I can apply all your instructions as they are.\n Jai Gurumaharaj.\n Jai Srila Prabhupada.\n Your servant of servants,\n Jayati."

I offer my respectful obeisances unto him.\n When will Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, who has established within this material world the mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Caitanya, give me shelter under his lotus feet?\n \n Dear Gurumaharaj,\n Obeisances to You from the front, from behind, and from all sides!\n You are my greatest attainment, my greatest Deity, my greatest friend, my greatest teacher, my greatest religious duty, my greatest wealth, my greatest glory, my greatest austerity, and my greatest knowledge. What more need I say? You are eternally everything to me. You are everything I have searched for in this world.\n Thank you for accepting me as your disciple, Gurumaharaj. Thank you very much!\n After this year’s Kārtik Yatra at Govardhan, I further visited Jagannath Puri for the first time and also in Kolkata — places of Śrīla Prabhupāda\u0027s schools, birthplace, and the Ultadanga Road. Without your mercy, I would not have visited that historically most significant place where Śrīla Prabhupāda met HH Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura for the first time.\n I wanted to share a realization I got from there. When I was kneeling in front of HH Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura\u0027s picture on his bed, I was strongly praying to be qualified to preach and assist you and Śrīla Prabhupāda in your mission. I felt very unqualified and helpless in my attempts and desires.\n A few minutes later, a brahmacārī welcomed us and was telling us about this place. After I shared my prayers with him, he mentioned that HG Jananivās Prabhu said that the best way of preaching is if we maintain purity!\n It made a deep impression in my heart receiving this instruction on the rooftop of that very birthplace of ISKCON. Śrīla Prabhupāda and you conquered everyone’s heart by your purity — your pure faith in the Lord and the holy names.\n Later in the week, I traveled further to Māyāpur and read in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam this beautiful verse which fully reminded me of you. Krishna instructs Uddhava:\n \n SB 11.7.44\n O King, a saintly person is just like water because he is free from all contamination, gentle by nature, and by speaking creates a beautiful vibration like that of flowing water. Just by seeing, touching or hearing such a saintly person, the living entity is purified, just as one is cleansed by contact with pure water. Thus a saintly person, just like a holy place, purifies all those who contact him because he always chants the glories of the Lord.\n Purport:\n The words apāṁ mitram, “just like water,” can also be read as aghān mitram, which means that a saintly person purifies all living entities by accepting them as mitram, or his personal friends, and saves them from their sinful reactions aghāt.\n A saintly person, however, is like pure water, free from all contamination and capable of purifying all things. Just as pure water is transparent, a saintly person transparently manifests the Personality of Godhead within his heart. Such love of Godhead is the reservoir of all happiness.\n Water makes a most pleasing vibration as it flows and cascades, and similarly the sound vibration of the Lord’s pure devotee, who is saturated with the glories of the Lord, is most charming and beautiful.\n \n This verse is so beautiful. Especially this part:\n A saintly person purifies all living entities by accepting them as mitram, or his personal friends, and saves them from their sinful reactions...\n And:\n Just as pure water is transparent, a saintly person transparently manifests the Personality of Godhead within his heart...\n During the Kārtik Yatra lectures of yours, you spoke exactly like it is described in this verse. You calibrate the consciousness back to one’s own nature of the soul — being an eternal servant of Krishna.\n I am inspired and overwhelmed by how deeply you sacrificed your life towards God and how intense your love is for Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n On Śrīla Prabhupāda\u0027s disappearance day, the couple who were HH Bhakti Tīrtha Swami\u0027s disciples shared a memory of him that deeply touched my heart and I am still meditating on that.\n The Prabhu once asked HH Bhakti Tīrtha Swami that people are misusing him, and Maharaja\u0027s answer was:\n \"I want to get used by everyone to uplift the consciousness. I don\u0027t care if they use me. In whatever way it works for the mission.\"\n This same mood I see within you as well, and I desire to love God and all living beings in the same mood, with the same love, with the same urgency.\n I read in the SB 11.2.52 purport:\n Just as one becomes very much concerned about any pain in one’s own body, one should be concerned with bringing the conditioned souls to the platform of devotional service so that all of their suffering will be banished forever.\n This is what I learned from you — to keep this mood in my forefront, to be a selfless servant of everyone and try to be an instrument of God\u0027s love.\n \n May my body become the asana of you.\n My senses the lamps of the temple of you.\n My desires the joy of your service, and my dedication a camara waving behind you.\n \n \n Your Servant of Your Servants,\n Jhulan Lila Devi Dasi"

Since early days, I have repeatedly heard you emphasizing the qualities of *tranadapi sunicena*, the quality of being a servant of servants, the quality of being grateful.\n This year, one devotee was offering glorification to Srila Prabhupada, and at that time, he quoted you once said, \"Gratitude is Bhakti.\" You begin all your talks by expressing gratitude to devotees. Even during your journey home – travel to India – you came across so many spiritual masters of different traditions; you always learned something good from them, being grateful to them.\n May I imbibe this quality of gratitude which you have been repeatedly emphasizing.\n I was hearing one of your classes on Selfless Attitude where you were reading from *SB* 10th Canto, and Parikshit Maharaj is asking there, \"Why does Krishna perform immoral tasks, dancing with the wives of others?\" There the section comes that Parikshit Maharaj, although now only one more day to leave, is asking questions not for his own sake but for the benefit of others – who may have such doubts, being *karmis*, *jnanis*... In this class, you emphasized the importance of how we should be living our lives for the welfare of others, rather than being self-occupied.\n \n Every word you speak is full of so much conviction, and you mean it, really.\n Recently, my most fond experience in this Kartik Yatra is getting the opportunity to see you chanting during the morning program in the Pandal. I have observed how you are so intense in everything, with a very prayerful attitude. For several minutes, I observed you offering prayers to Tulsi Maharani. This scene is imprinted in my mind. Same way, during the night dancing kirtan, you urged us to call out the holy name very seriously, with feeling. I see this feeling is something missing in my practice of Krishna Consciousness.\n \n You always appreciate your God brothers wholeheartedly, with great delight. And you expect all your disciples to treat/serve your godbrothers with great respect and love.\n \n It is my great fortune that I have the association of your beloved disciples. By seeing their dedication, service, and commitment, I get some glimpse of how glorious a master I have. I am grateful to you, Maharaj, for all the wonderful gifts in Krishna consciousness you have bestowed upon me: association of HG Radheshyam Prabhuji, vibrant Sanga at ISKCON NVCC, so many loving friends, resources, money, and all facilities to preach.\n Despite all this, I regret that I am not able to take full benefit of these great gifts. I am still struggling with my lower nature of passion and ignorance. This year, although you mercifully were awarding the sacred second initiation, as per the guidance and advice of HG Radheshyam Prabhu, I thought to wait and not take this step unless I overcome my lower natures. However, seeing my situation, I feel hopeless, Gurudev, that on my own strength, I will be able to overcome my weakness. I need your causeless mercy. I am too much affected by the bodily conception of life, and I take this body too seriously. I seek your blessings that may I be able to serve as per your expectations.\n \n I have so many material desires still lurking in my heart. I know if I take shelter of your lotus feet, I will surely be successful in becoming a pure devotee one day.\n \n Kindly forgive my offenses, as I have neglected, disregarded so many good instructions you have imparted for my welfare. I am knowingly eating poison by not paying heed to this.\n \n Thank you for everything. My prayers to Sri Sri Radhaa Vrindavanchandra, Sri Sri Gaur Nitai, Srila Prabhupada that may they give you good health and long life, so that many of us who are dependent on you continue to get your divine Sanga.\n Your Servant,\n Kadamb Kanan Das\n ISKCON NVCC Pune Ashram."

That sacred blend,\nThat makes my spirit laugh and mend.\nLike when you said, with that witty charm,\n“B.Com means Be Calm!” — it won everyone\u0027s heart.\n\nMay my life revolve around your word,\nMay your teachings be my only world.\nIf ever I err, please correct me true,\nLet my heart remain aligned with you.\n\nYou found me broken, made me whole,\nPlaced faith again within my soul.\nNow all I want, O father dear,\nIs to serve you life to life without any fear.\n\nCorrect me softly, guide me still,\nBend my heart to your holy will.\nFor all I want my heart to hold,\nIs that to my GuruMaharaj my soul is sold.\n\nAnd when this journey finds its close,\nMay my soul to your shelter go.\nFor all I have, and all I’ll be,\nForever belongs, GuruMaharaj, to thee.\n\nOn this sacred 75th Vyasa Puja, I bow to my eternal father, HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj, the living embodiment of compassion, wisdom, and divine love.\n\nBy the mercy of Srila Prabhupada and the blessings of Sri Sri Radha and Krishna, may I forever remain a tiny flower at his lotus feet, serving his mission, living his words, and carrying his smile as my eternal light.\n\nYours Pagal daughter,\nKajal\nDelhi, ISKCON EOK"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dearest Radhanath Swami Maharaj,\nplease accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nLast October you accepted me as your servant in Srila Prabhupada’s mission, offering me the name Kalindi Gopi devi dasi.\nI would have liked to be your Hanuman, but I quickly realized that I’m not even a squirrel nor a spider… I’m just a speck of dust that some merciful devotees put in a place to serve in some tiny way.\nYour mercy is like an ocean without bottom and without shores, and in this aspect, you are so similar to your beloved guru maharaj and founder Acarya of Iskcon, His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada.\nYou received your first initiation via letter, and as far as I know, you didn’t have so much *vapu* association with him, but nevertheless, you served him with all your life and soul, and you are still serving him, inspiring other souls to follow his footsteps back to Godhead.\nYour disciple Anubhava mataji said that we are very fortunate because you are offering us the possibility to serve you in separation.\nInitially, after initiation, I was overwhelmed by sadness. Then, thanks to the mercy of my parents, Karuna Caitaya das and bhaktin Paola, and my *shiksa* guru Bhaktya Labhya prabhu, I started to perceive your presence in my daily life. I never felt so much love, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this opportunity.\nYou are such an extraordinary example and a reservoir of all good qualities that being connected with you gives your disciples the possibility to tune into your love and devotion. You are so present through your *vani* form and also through the sweet memories of all your reciprocations that you kindly offer. And you are reciprocating also now, that you are thousands of kilometers away from me, teaching me that spiritual love can transcend every oceanic distance that reduces itself to the water contained in the hoofprint of a calf.\nSrila Prabhupada, during one of his last days on this planet Earth, said to his disciples: “It is my duty to increase your love for me.” You are also doing this with all of us disciples. But not to keep this love for you. No, you are nourishing and increasing our love for you only to offer it to Srila Prabhupada and to the Lord.\nSo you are a transparent medium, and loving you, we can learn how to love Krishna. What an extraordinary service, Maharaj, you are offering to the Lord. I have no words to thank you; I just want to offer my life to your lotus feet. You are healing me from envy during your every *kirtan*; you gave me two best friends and a lot of extraordinary devotees to learn from and to serve; you definitely saved my life.\nPlease, continue to accept the grape and the pear with ghee that I offered you after the initiation *yajna*: it was so insignificant as a gift, but you, in order to encourage me, accepted it as something very precious.\nYou preach with every gesture you do. Your *Krishna-katha* are appreciated by thousands of devotees, and yet you are so humble as to wash the dishes of the devotees. You are giving me the strength to continue my service here in Torino, allowing me to gradually add Krishna in my life.\nI hope to make you happy, Maharaj.\nMy life is yours; please make me dance.\nI also pray that Sri Sri Radha Gopinath will always protect you physically, mentally, and spiritually.\nYour insignificant and grateful servant,\nKalindi Gopi Devi Dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "My dear Guru Maharaj Hare Krsna and dandavat pranam. Please accept my humble obeisances, myself and my life in your service and in the service of those who are serving you.\n This is my great fortune that I have received this opportunity to offer heartfelt words of gratitude, love, care, and respect unto your lotus feet, dear Guru Maharaj.\n \n I pray for humility, as that is going to please you very much. Actually, it will be very easily attained if I just follow your footsteps. Praying for your mercy to achieve this.\n \n Finally, when you entered India, you promised that you shall do something good for the people of India. Whenever I read this sentence, it echoes in my ears; a divine, grave voice says, \"He is referring to you. Are you going to do something substantial to make his words come true?\" This has not happened just once, but every time I read that paragraph. When I turn to see who spoke this, I see Krsna on one side and Gaurahari on another side. \"Get up, stay focused, just follow him, and fulfill his expectation he has from you.\" I hear this. This is your mercy and protection.\n \n In one 2024 initiation lecture, you said that \"In our conditioned state, we might not take seriously the blessing, the opportunity, the light, and the beauty of life in this world.\" My prayer is that I want to take the opportunity you have given me to seek deep association with the sincere devotees from the Chowpatty and BCEC temple, who are following your instructions very sincerely and with complete surrender. My prayer is that I want to take the opportunity to hear and develop a taste to hear, read, and imbibe Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, and all the Gaudiya scriptures absolutely essential for me, from the great teachers you have given me.\n \n In another class given by you in 2020, you mentioned that \"Compassion is the most meaningful human experience.\" From the bottom of my heart, I mean this: that I need your mercy to follow this. I want to follow this instruction all the time; my desire is to possess this quality as my natural nature. When I heard how you stopped the car, got down from it, and came to the little puppy and chanted the Hare Krsna mahamantra in its ears, since then, I always pray that I want my heart to be a storehouse of compassion towards all. I want to please you with this quality; please grant me your mercy.\n \n As a new year meditation in 2021, you mentioned that \"When we understand our purpose, nothing will discourage us.\" Amongst many of your quotes that I have collected and stored in my heart, this one is very important for me, and this quote has helped me in many situations of life. In some difficult or challenging situations when I need to stay motivated, I stand in front of your photograph, pray to you, and remember this quote, just like Krsna spoke; I hear these words from you, \"Give up lethargy, get up, and fight.\" I receive a lot of strength from this instruction.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, there are many, many instances of how your quotes have emerged like a lighthouse in the middle of the ocean with giant waves of uncertainty, or like a torch in a deep, dark cave of hopelessness, or like a rose with many thorns of challenges.\n \n I am ever grateful to you, to dear Srila Prabhupada, and unto Sri Sri Radha Gopinath that all of them sent you into my life, and the boat of my life received a captain who can navigate my life with his golden words and with his own life as the best example I can ever follow.\n \n Seeking your shelter more than ever, begging for mercy and empowerment to be able to fulfill the expectations you have from me, so that I can please you dearly.\n \n May I always remain your servant and the servant of those who serve you, who assist you in the mission of HDG Srila Prabhupada , your daughter Kalyani Radhika devidasi."

Surprisingly, it was my birthday, and I would say this is the best gift I have ever received. You take us through different levels of religion and spirituality through your own journey in your book. You finally take us to the ultimate platform of Vraja Bhakti. You are a true Vrajavasi, as evident in your deep attachment to Sri Vrindavan Dham. You have given us Vrindavan in the form of GEV. Vrindavan in your heart has manifested outside as GEV. Your constant emphasis in lectures is pure devotional service of the highest standard. You are a lover of Krishna, and you want us to also love Krishna and be happy.\nMaharaj, you very much emphasize two qualities: humility and gratitude. Your every lecture begins by expressing gratitude to the audience. You teach us how grateful we should be to Srila Prabhupada for the hardships he has taken for uplifting us. You teach us to be grateful to everyone who is helping in our service to the Lordships. Almost in every lecture, you speak about humility, “trnad api sunicena.” You don’t speak it but live by it; it is your life and soul, a personal instruction from your spiritual master. You write your designation, not a sanyasi, but a servant in the record book of GEV. As Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur would say, ‘daso ’smi’ to his disciples when they would pay obeisances. Maharaj, you don’t consider devotees who are serving you personally as your servants. One person wanted to give something to Maharaj. He asked, \u0027Can I give it to your servants?\u0027 Maharaj replied, \u0027You can give it to them, but they are not my servants.\u0027 In the Satsang program in 2023 at Pune with HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj, HH GKGM gave a lecture for more than an hour, and you then spoke for 15 minutes, and that too only about the glories of HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj.\nMaharaj, you want ISKCON to be a united family. The culture of love and devotion that you have created at ISKCON Chowpatty is adored throughout the ISKCON world. You have given so much inspiration to devotees to remain united through lectures, through yatras. The Kartik Yatra is the most awaited time of the whole year for all the devotees who seek shelter and inspiration in you.\nWe are very, very thankful to you, Maharaj, for giving us HG RSP. Because of HG RSP, we got connected to the glorious movement of Srila Prabhupada and were saved from the perils of the material world. We are very fortunate to receive this opportunity to serve in the mission of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. We pray to you, Maharaj, to accept us as humble servants at your lotus feet. May we be able to serve in the mission of Srila Prabhupada lifelong.\nYour insignificant servant,\nKamal Kishore Upadhyay"

After all, we always need your blessing and mercy to come out of our own comfort zone and to struggle with Maya.\n We are always seeking your association through your instructions and always praying for your good health.\n Yours,\n Insignificant servants,\n Kanai Gopal das \u0026 Jaya bhakti devi dasi."

Though we\u0027re not at all qualified, by your causeless mercy, we are getting strength to practice devotional service. After completing the 2024 Kartik Yatra, we were wondering where the 2025 Kartik Yatra would happen. Generally, it would be Vrindavan Dham. Internally, I had a feeling that due to traffic restrictions, it would be very difficult to accommodate all the devotees in Vrindavan. I was thinking this year the yatra might happen in Govardhan. It had been a long time since we stayed in Govardhan during Kartik. We too had a desire to hear your pravachan and get your association at Govardhan. Somehow, on Goura Purnima day, it was announced that this year the yatra is in Govardhan. Our dream became true by your causeless mercy. Our children Jamuna, Toshan, and Keshav were very enthusiastic to attend the yatra. The children really enjoyed the Kids Zone. It is a great experience to associate with devotees in the holy dham and do Govardhan parikrama. Due to the responsibility to take care of the children, I could not sit near your vyasasan and hear the class. Now I am trying to hear those lectures daily. Dear Gurudev, we have so many anarthas in our hearts. It\u0027s very difficult to overcome the temptations of maya, Maharaj. On this Vyasa Puja, we pray at your Lotus feet that we may always remain in association with sincere devotees who are rendering transcendental loving devotional service.\n Your insignificant servants, Kanai Govinda das and Santhoshi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurudeva,\n \n All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n \n Today, the world rejoices. Or perhaps it only feels so to those who have experienced the shelter of your presence. As the sacred mark of your seventy-fifth year shines upon us, my heart does not leap with pride. Instead, it bows lower. I feel the quiet weight of my unworthiness and the immeasurable grace you have showered upon us.\n \n I remember that day like it was yesterday. Wednesday, the second of September 1992. It was a stormy monsoon evening in Bombay. Black clouds rumbled overhead. They threatened to burst at any moment, yet not a single drop had fallen all day. A thirteen-year-old schoolboy, young and bewildered, had wandered into the Rādhā Gopīnātha temple hall. Was it accident or fate? I cannot say.\n \n Lightning split the sky. A small crowd of perhaps a dozen guests had gathered in the temple room. The curtains were about to open for the evening ārati. You sifted through the crowd and walked straight towards the boy. Taking his hands in yours, you asked gently, as if enquiring on behalf of some divine power itself: \"Are you here to stay?\"\n \n He did not know what \u0027stay\u0027 truly meant. To stay with saints. To stay with a path. To stay with the calling of one\u0027s own soul. Yet he answered, \"Yes, I will stay.\"\n \n As soon as he spoke these words, you smiled, showered him with a few more graceful words, and folded your hands. At that very moment, thunder rolled across the sky. The clouds, as if holding on till that sacred exchange, parted and poured torrential rains. Just as clouds give way and causelessly shower their mercy in the form of life-giving water, you showered the mercy of Lord Caitanya upon me, a soul bereft of it for many lifetimes.\n Now, more than three decades later, here I am. Still staying.\n \n As I reflect, I see that I did not stay out of strength. I clung. I leeched on. Still clumsy. Still learning how to be a gentleman, how to be a servant, how to be grateful. If I am still here, if any fragment of sincerity has survived the storms of my mind, it is only because your words carried a potency beyond sound. It is in your sound form that you are constantly with us.\n In your physical presence, you are like the sun. When you are out of sight, some cry that the sun has set. They no longer feel its warmth directly upon them. But the sun never sets. It simply shines elsewhere, nurturing another horizon. As you travel the globe, giving your physical presence to everyone, you are not always visible. Yet you are never absent in sound.\n In the year 2000, you offered me a few instructions for life. I truly cherish them, meditating on them daily. I foolishly thought those were ‘the instructions’. With time, I learned otherwise. Every glance held guidance. Every silence spoke. Even moments where no word passed between us carried more teaching than I had space to store.\n \n Being in your presence is illuminating. Forgetting your words is error. Remembering you is embracing grace.\n \n Gurudeva, I cannot claim understanding. Nor progress. Nor qualification. But if a student\u0027s worth is measured not by brilliance but by longing, then perhaps one day even my hesitant heart may learn to walk rather than cling.\n \n Until then, let me remain dust beneath the feet of those who follow you with clarity. Whilst I stumble and crawl behind them. Not out of despair, but out of stubborn hope.\n May your compassion remain the compass. May your words remain the oar. May this unrefined soul continue, somehow, to remain near your light.\n \n On this sacred day, I offer no achievement. Only gratitude. And a desire to be shaped by your grace, even if I take a lifetime to become worthy of it.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Kartik Candra dāsa\n Forever learning how to stay"

I was so shocked that I forgot to pay my obeisances to you! Then I got to know you wanted to take a bath, and I was the only devotee in that hotel at that point in time! I gladly welcomed you into the room!\nAfter your bath and when you were ready to leave, you gave us the garland and also a very big, special smile! All my nervousness and sadness vanished immediately, and the rest of the Yatra went off very well! My mother-in-law also recovered quickly, attended the Yatra without any further problem, and thoroughly enjoyed participating in all the kirtans, hearing all the classes, and enthusiastically visiting every place/temple/kund wherever you, Gurudev, made us visit! It\u0027s still my BEST YATRA to date, as you made it so SPECIAL! Thank you very much, once again, Maharaj! 🙏🙏🙏\nWe pray for your good health, and may Lord Krishna always protect you from any kind of danger! Happiest birthday wishes to you, Gurudev!

Whether you speak to a common villager in Maharashtra, to the senators at the House of Commons, or to your loving disciples, you always find a way to focus on this essence through all the superficialities. You always speak of focusing on this essence in every situation of life and in every person, just like a honeybee focuses on the nectar of honey in a lonely flower without getting distracted by all the superficialities existing around it. Indeed, this essence is the common fabric that connects all the living entities to the singular purpose of loving service to Krishna – “jīvera ‘svarūpa’ haya — kṛṣṇera ‘nitya-dāsa’” CC Madhya 20.108. Maharaj, it is miraculous to see how by focusing on this essence, you gain the appreciation and confidence of everyone, irrespective of their profession, status of life, nationality, religion, philosophical beliefs, race, or gender. Maharaj, I aspire to follow your divine instructions in this regard to be able to focus on this essence of pure bhakti amidst all the turbulence and distractions in this world. I wish to focus on this essence in every person I meet, disregarding all their apparent shortcomings and worldly distractions. And most importantly, by your kind mercy, I aspire to focus on this essence in every limb of bhakti. Indeed, without focusing on this essence, I can see that any spiritual practice would not lead me to the highest desired benefit.\n \n Gurumaharaj, you are an embodiment of humility and service attitude. You teach and live by the principle of serving and pleasing devotees without any expectations in return. In every lecture of yours, you focus on the principle of being the servant of the servant of devotees and the verse tṛṇād api sunīcena. Maharaj, you have personally set a very high example of this principle. In the Radha Gopinath temple, you focused on this aspect so much that the devotees live together in a community with the only aspiration to serve other devotees selflessly. You have established very high standards for guest care and devotee care. Some examples include having central air-conditioning in the temple hall and deity kitchen, very high prasadam standards, a separate kitchen for guest devotees, special care and engagement for elderly devotees and children, and special programs for youth are some of the few points to name. During the Kartik yatra where more than 12,000 devotees participate, you made sure that no devotee needs to wait for more than 5 minutes for getting their prasadam plate. Even then, you ensured that for the 5 minutes for which the devotees need to wait, they should get to stand in a pandal, so they do not have to face the sun. Maharaj, it is heart-warming to see your humility and simplicity in dealing with your godbrothers. You show by your example how we should always wear the garland of tṛṇād api sunīcena while dealing with devotees. You always make sure to pass any credit that comes to you to Srila Prabhupada and the previous acharyas. During the South India yatra, when you were given special recognition by the Srirangam temple Vaishnavas by offering you a lot of worship by seating you on an elephant, you immediately offered all the glory to Srila Prabhupada. Maharaj, your unwavering determination to fulfill the desire of Prabhupada is unimaginable. Despite the innumerable challenges, you were persistent in establishing the Govardhan eco-village as an offering to Srila Prabhupada to fulfill his desire to establish farm communities. Maharaj, though you have established such a huge community in India where you could retire in the association of your loving disciples, you have taken the responsibility to travel worldwide to inspire many in the path of bhakti, trying to fulfill Prabhupada’s focus on an “international” society. There are thousands of devotees who gather to hear each of your talks in India; on the other hand, sometimes you only have an audience of a few tens while you speak in New York. In either case, you always have the same intensity of loving service to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Maharaj, you show such a high example of personal detachment and subordination to authority. You took up unimaginable services during your stay at New Vrindavan in the initial days. In those days, you would hardly get to sleep a couple of hours between the offerings. Later, you traveled all through North America establishing college preaching far and wide. Then you were told to go to India and establish the preaching there. At that time, the preaching you had established in the colleges in America was flourishing far and wide, but as soon as the instruction came, you left all of that and returned to India. When you returned to India in 1987, you were entrusted with a small, dilapidated, one-room ashram in Mumbai. The few existing ashramites were engulfed in bitterness and scandal and were at war with the surrounding congregation. You took charge of the situation and carefully invested your time and energy, practically your entire life, to cultivate the community of devotees. In those days, you would give a program in the morning at the temple, have special classes for the brahmacharis in the afternoon, and a program for the congregation every day. You focused on cultivating devotees according to their inclinations and interests in seva. Eventually, you had inspired several of your disciples to be leaders in assisting you in building the community. After a lot of committed endeavor blessed with Krishna’s grace, you established a thriving community with several satellite centers, hundreds of brahmacharis, and tens of thousands of congregation members. It is for the service and engagement of the devotees in the congregation that you pioneered the establishment of the Bhaktivedanta hospital, Gopal school, orphanage, prasadam distribution program, and several other initiatives.\n \n Maharaj, I am very grateful to your disciple Radheshyam Prabhu, by whose efforts I could receive the opportunity to be a part of the VOICE system which introduced me to the path of bhakti. Due to this system, I could stay with sincere devotees and cultivate pure devotional service during my college education in Chennai. I am also so much indebted to my counselor Amal Mahaprabhu Prabhu, who has been so instrumental in helping me progress in the path of bhakti by systematically teaching me shastras and inspiring me to put them into practice.\n \n Maharaj, with the help of some wonderful friends at my university, we were able to host several programs including talks by HH Romapada Swami and Chaitanya Charan Prabhu. We had 40+ students join for these programs and connect to the path of bhakti. We also host weekly sessions as a part of the Bhakti Circle whereby we have a few students join us and experience the joy of devotional service. Gurudeva, I would like to offer all these endeavors unto your lotus feet. We also seek your blessings by which we can continue to host several more programs in the future and inspire many students to practice pure devotional service!\n \n Maharaj, I am so much indebted to you for setting such an amazing example of how we should put our hearts into each and every limb of bhakti we practice. I was so much inspired to see the helplessness with which you chant the holy names while I received the opportunity to chant in your association for a short duration during the Sadhu Sangha retreat in Dallas. Maharaj, by your blessings, I wish to take this resolution to at least aspire to chant with the same mood daily. I also commit that except in unavoidable situations, I will chant at least 12 rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra in the morning before I leave for my daily responsibilities. Maharaj, you always focus on reading Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books and living by those books. I get so much inspiration when I hear how you would somehow or other make the time to read Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books while you were engaged in many services during your stay at New Vrindavan. At one instance, you would have Prabhupada’s book on the side to read them while you were milking the cows, since that is the only time you would get for the same! Maharaj, I am so happy to inform you that by your mercy, I am able to read Prabhupada’s books consistently for the past 7 years. Maharaj, I am currently reading the 10th canto. Maharaj, I want to commit that I will read Prabhupada’s books for at least 30 minutes every day. Gurudeva, you have given your heart and soul in giving thousands of lectures over the last 35 years. Maharaj, when your disciple comes to you for asking for personal instructions, you often point them to your lectures, informing them that you have given all your personal instructions in your lectures. Gurumaharaj, I feel so unfortunate that I am not able to receive this mercy of yours coming in the form of your lectures. I want to take the commitment that I will hear your lectures with one-pointed attention for at least 30 minutes every week!\n \n Maharaj, I feel myself so unqualified and unworthy of receiving your mercy. I am constantly being crushed by all my anarthas, including the anartha of false pride which you very much despise. But I have no other hope other than to pray for a drop of your causeless mercy, which is the only way by which I can somehow focus on the goal of pure devotional service without being carried away by any of the distractions. Maharaj, I offer my humble and heartfelt prayers to Sri Sri Radha Krishna, Gaura Nitai, and all our wonderful acharyas so that you may have very good health for many more years to come, so that you can inspire countless souls in the path of pure bhakti. Maharaj, I want to conclude with an excerpt from a lecture that I heard sometime back, which I want to keep as my aspiration for being the servant of the servant of the servant of devotees!\n \n Question to Maharaj: You were mentioning how we must be so thankful to those who help us in making even the slightest spiritual advancement. Whenever you are here, you are inspiring us so much by your lectures and kirtans, so how can we repay the debt which we owe you?\n Answer: Actually, I am doing nothing, but your sentiments are very nice. If you want to do something to repay, you serve one another and love one another, put aside all the criticisms, and really try to be the true brothers and sisters of one another and thereby make this congregation a loving family of servants of Radha Gopinath. That is how you can best repay. In fact, that\u0027s all we want. Just try to purify yourselves in this mood of loving relationships because that will create an atmosphere that will attract the world to the lotus feet of Krishna. Prabhupada said you show your love for me by how you cooperate with each other, so ultimately our debt is to him: to be a humble servant of Vaishnavas and strive to purify ourselves by chanting the holy names. Krishna – The Master of Mystics, Mumbai 1992}}\n \n Your Insignificant Aspiring Disciple,\n Kaushik."

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Maharaj, as time is passing in KC, I am gradually coming to understand and realize your role and contribution as the most rare and valuable fortune I could ever receive. Although physically distant, I feel your deep concern and love for me through your words, devotees, and your example.\n \n Maharaj, the most beautiful aspect is your love for Srila Prabhupada. I am amazed that every action of yours is in complete absorption of Srila Prabhupada\u0027s pleasure. Every seva initiated and manifested by you, be it Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Govardhan Ecovillage, yatras, or Western preaching, is with the deep desire to love and please Prabhupada. Maharaj, your love for Prabhupada manifests as your deep respect, appreciation, and gratitude for other Prabhupada disciples. Years back, on Prabhupada\u0027s disappearance day, when your Godsister was giving her offering for Prabhupada and time went beyond 7:20 pm, you considered allowing her to continue glorifying Prabhupada as greater seva than singing *Je anilo* at 7:20 pm! Your offering of gratitude to Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj through book distribution, keeping your head at the lotus feet of your Godbrothers, keeping their instructions as the topmost priority, and always emphasizing cooperation shows how deeply you love Srila Prabhupada. You are the best gift of Srila Prabhupada in my life. Please bless me with genuine appreciation and love for Srila Prabhupada, for you, Prabhupada\u0027s disciples, and for devotees all around me. In one lecture, you answered that for us, along with appreciation for Prabhupada\u0027s disciples, it is so important to increase our appreciation for the love and service offered by each devotee around us.\n \n Your emphasis on devotee care is so deeply evident in yatra, projects, and devotees taking your instructions to their hearts. \"Part of devotee care is to allow devotees whom you care for to serve you\" is so deep and profound, Maharaj. Mukhwas seva in yatra, encouraging matajis to cook chapattis, and appreciating devotees cooking on chulhas for Govardhan brings out that what you truly appreciate and value are devotees and their coming closer to Krishna. Maharaj, one statement by you hit me so hard: when our legs were jammed, sitting in one position from Mangala arati till class, the first statement you said was, \"The association where devotees are coming together to call out to and hear about Krishna is the rarest! What you are getting now, please understand, is the rarest thing even demigods are desiring for!\" Maharaj, please bless this wretched soul with the understanding and appreciation of devotees in my life. Please bless me with the intelligence to be able to respect everyone properly and serve accordingly.\n \n Maharaj, the most beautiful and rarest thing you are offering us is your absorption in Krishna. By your mercy, this was my first yatra, and we all could feel your deep, ecstatic love for Krishna in your kirtans and kathas. Time really became conspicuous by its absence as you went on glorifying Govardhan. In your calling out to Krishna, you gave us an indescribable experience of Krishna and the spiritual world, Guru Maharaj. When you mentioned chanting as if this is your last moment on your deathbed, between you and Krishna, in the association of devotees, for those few moments, a conditioned soul like me could call out to Krishna with deep emotion and intention. Maharaj, please bless me with the understanding that what you are offering us in the form of love for Krishna is the rarest, and let me never leave this for the petty allurements of maya. Please give me strength to choose Krishna, and if I shake, please hold me, Guru Maharaj. I am very weak and helplessly being dragged by maya again and again.\n \n Maharaj, you are most accessible in my life through your lectures and devotees. Your lectures are deeply personal; I feel your genuine love and deep concern for me in your lectures. The best part is when, through your lectures, you make us realize and feel the situation of the characters, be it Prahlada, mother Kunti, Vrtrasura, or Gajendra. Hearing from you, I am able to increase my appreciation for the surrender of various characters in their circumstances. Maharaj, your lectures are my lifeline. Please help me realize and understand that your lectures are your personal association for me, and the more I imbibe and follow your vani in my life, the more intimate connection I can develop with you and please you. Maharaj, you are offering your love in the form of beautiful devotees in my life: mature seniors, intimate friends, enthusiastic juniors, and loving parents. Please bless me with obedience to seniors, intimacy and non-envy among friends, and genuine selflessness and compassion for juniors.\n \n Maharaj, I feel deeply amazed by your appreciation and gratitude for every person who is even slightly willing to appreciate and accept the gift of bhakti in their lives. You are a touchstone; everyone you come in contact with is touched with Krishna\u0027s love. Through your small gestures and dealings, you are offering us access to Krishna. Please bless me, Guru Maharaj, to become a transparent via medium of the mercy of Guru parampara and share this rarest gift of bhakti with each and every person I come in contact with.\n \n Guru Maharaj, as time is passing and the defensive nature of my false ego, envy, jnani, and yogic contaminations—anarthas—are getting revealed, I feel helplessly dragged by them. I lack words to express gratitude to you for offering me the best gift. Please help me realize its value and strive to maintain and preserve this. Please use me as your instrument in whatever way pleases you in service to Srila Prabhupada and his mission. I feel so protected in your merciful shelter, Guru Maharaj. If it pleases you, please accept me as a servant of your servants in your seva.\n Thank you so much, Guru Maharaj,\n Aspiring to be a servant of your servants,\n Khushi"

As I pen down these words, I am overwhelmed with gratitude and reverence for the invaluable role you have played in my life.\n \n Your teachings have been a beacon of light, guiding me through the darkest corners of uncertainty.\n \n Every word you have spoken, whether through a personal interaction or through your soul-stirring lectures, has carried wisdom, touching not only my mind but also my soul.\n \n You have shown me the path of knowledge, humility, and self-discovery, making me realize the importance of inner growth.\n \n Gurudev, as a small, insignificant part of your congregation, having the blessed opportunity of being born and brought up in Your divine association and under the care of Your shelter, there are three constant traits in Your holy nature that I have been able to observe since childhood with my limited vision: patience, compassion, and affection, be it anyone You are dealing with or in any situation.\n \n I would like to briefly share a small personal interaction of which I was a part during the blessed event of receiving Brahmin Diksha from You in April 2024. We were briefly called into Your room in GEV and had the blessed opportunity to have Your association. During that time, I briefly got the opportunity to mention how, through Your lectures, you have had a tremendous impact on myself as well as our Amritsar congregation on how to create, lead, and maintain an ideal spiritual balance in family life and relationships. Immediately, You looked at me and mentioned, \"I personally don\u0027t know of how big an impact it must\u0027ve made, since I myself left my house when I was 19,\" and You laughed heartily thereafter.\n \n From that brief interaction, I realized here is a divine personality, a foremost general in Srila Prabhupada\u0027s army, who has never ever taken credit for anything in life and has only taught and led an exemplary life of love, affection, respect, and, most of all, sacrifice.\n \n Today, on behalf of everyone present here for this Special Vyas Puja offering, we would like to thank You for Your boundless kindness and relentless dedication for gifting Your entire life to uplifting others.\n \n We are privileged to call ourselves Your disciples and hope to carry forward the values You have instilled in us for serving the beautiful movement of ISKCON.\n \n May You continue to inspire countless others as You have inspired us.

You are the living representative of Śrī Vyāsadeva, the compassionate medium through whom transcendental knowledge flows into this dark world.\n \n Gurudeva, I am eternally indebted to you. By your causeless mercy, I have found shelter from the storm of material life. Your words illuminate the path of bhakti, guiding us gently but firmly toward the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. You have taught us not only philosophy, but the true meaning of humility, service, and surrender.\n \n Through your lectures, kīrtans, and personal example, you have shown us how a real devotee lives — always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, always serving, always compassionate. You never tire of encouraging us, even when we stumble. You see beyond our faults and awaken our dormant desire to serve.\n \n When I look at your life, I see what it means to live for Kṛṣṇa — constant dedication, tireless preaching, boundless patience, and unconditional love for all souls. You are truly a servant of the servant of the Lord, and your mercy is our only hope.\n \n Whatever little progress I have made on this spiritual path is only because of your guidance and blessings. Without you, I would still be lost in illusion. You have given me the greatest gift — the knowledge of who I really am and what my true purpose in life is.\n \n On this day, I pray that I may always remain under your shelter, never forget your instructions, and always strive to please you through sincere service. Please bless me that I may one day develop even a fraction of the devotion and compassion that shines so brightly in you.\n \n Thank you, Gurudeva, for everything — for your mercy, your patience, your prayers, your love, and your endless sacrifices for our spiritual upliftment.

All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n\nOn this sacred day of your 75th appearance, my heart overflows with gratitude for your divine presence in this world and in my life. You are the embodiment of compassion and the living current of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy. Your life of selfless service continues to illuminate the path for so many wandering souls—myself included—showing what it truly means to live for the pleasure of Guru and Kṛṣṇa.\n\nI reflect often upon the first time I met you; it still feels as though time stood still. My soul recognized its source—a homecoming beyond words. In that moment, a seed of devotion was planted so deep within my heart that even now, years later, I continue to water it through your instructions, through sādhana, and through serving under your shelter.\n\nThis year, one verse has echoed constantly within my heart as a reflection of your mercy and guidance:\n\n\"teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam\n dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te\"\n Bhagavad-gītā 10.10\n\n\"To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\"\n\nMaharaja, I experience this verse not as a distant ideal, but as a living reality—revealed through your teachings and through the wisdom you’ve empowered in Kaustubha Das \u0026 Raghunath Das Prabhus, whom I am fortunate to have such close association with. Their guidance, laughter, humility, and sincerity continually redirect me to your lotus feet and to the heart of Kṛṣṇa’s service. Through you and in turn them, I have come to see how intelligence and intuition both arise from love-filled devotion, not ambition.\n\nIn my practice and service this year, I’ve sought to deepen my *satatayuktānām*—to stay connected in every moment through remembrance, prayer, and offering. When I am tempted to rely on my own strength, I hear your gentle voice reminding me that true intelligence arises only when the heart is surrendered. You are teaching me that *buddhi-yoga* is not cleverness—it is the grace of divine understanding that flows when the heart is aligned in service.\n\nYour example continues to shape my every endeavor. Through your life, I am learning that devotion is not meant to be performed, but embodied; that spiritual strength is born from softness; that love is the highest intelligence.\n\nMaharaja, I pray to always remain connected to you through service, through the *sangha* of sincere devotees, and through the unceasing remembrance of your compassion and instructions. May I become a transparent instrument of your will, and may every step of my life bring glory to your mission and to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s legacy.\n\nWith a heart full of love, reverence, and unending gratitude, I offer myself again and again at your lotus feet.\n\nYour servant of the servant,\nKishori Gopi Devi Dāsī from Vermont"

Previously, when I was very new to ISKCON—which I still consider myself to be—I wouldn’t fully believe this. However, the day I heard about you for the very first time, through H.G.

That day, when I first saw you, I asked myself the same question, and my heart did not immediately respond.\n \n However, December 7, 2024, became a special day. Unaware that it was the Vyasa Puja of my Guru Maharaj, I was casually listening to the glorification of a Prabhupada disciple. I heard a lecture from H.G. Amogh Lila Prabhu in which he was glorifying Guru Maharaj. That day will always remain special to me, especially hearing about your struggles to reach India.\n You are like a huge ocean, and I am a drop of water coming from far away just to mix with you. Just like the ocean, you have qualities I cannot describe in a single day. Your humbleness towards everyone keeps me motivated in my daily sadhana. Your watery eyes just like Prabhupada\u0027s show compassion towards everyone, and your welcoming smile makes the devotees\u0027 hearts melt. The way you join your hands and greet every single devotee will always be in my core memory, and the way you sit so steadily, just like what Prabhupada said in his lectures about sitting straight, is truly inspiring.\n \n I have accepted you as my father, mother, my Guru, and my master, and I am your insignificant servant. Whenever I see you, I wish I could touch your lotus feet, and I cry my heart out, knowing only you would listen.\n I am learning to be compassionate and humble from you.\n Sometimes I feel that you have descended to this material world just to free me from its grip and take me back with you, Srila Prabhupada, and Krishna.\n \n On the day of your Vyasa Puja, I have nothing material to offer you. I can only promise that I will always be loyal to ISKCON and our beloved Prabhupada. I am eagerly waiting for the day when you will give diksha to me and bestow upon me my new name. Guru Maharaj, I am very far away from you, but please bless me so that I can see you in my heart every minute, every second. I am eagerly looking forward to your upcoming Vyas Puja so I can have your darshan again. I have a wish to meet you personally, but most importantly, I want to hear your lectures very carefully and accept every word as it is in my life.\n \n Happy 75th Vyasa Puja, Guru Maharaj.\n I will miss you every day until December 7, 2025.\n \n Your Servant,\n Komal"

Once Govind Prabhu said Guru Maharaj is someone for whom you don’t have to die for or give your life for. He meant that he is not a leader of a mission where you have to give up your life. He is a teacher. This understanding took me time and now I have realized that I need to understand your message and follow that.

Behind each person, there may be a story of abuses, bruises, difficulties which only Krishna knows as the personalized localized super soul.

As the Vaishnava song says,\n\nkṛṣṇa se tomāra, kṛṣṇa dite pāro,\ntomāra śakati āche\nāmi to\u0027 kāṅgala, \u0027kṛṣṇa\u0027 \u0027kṛṣṇa\u0027 boli\u0027,\ndhāi tava pāche pāche :\n\n“Krishna is yours. You have the power to give Him to me. I am simply running behind you, crying out, ‘Krishna! Krishna!’”\n\nBy seeing you, Gurudev, I receive hope, strength, and courage in my bhakti. Please let me become like you—without selfish desires, independent motives, or pride. If you examine me, you will find no qualities, only faults. My entire existence depends on your mercy. Without it, I cannot survive even a moment.\n\nO Gurudev, I thirst for just one drop of your mercy. You know all my weaknesses—my lack of taste for japa, my absence of seva-bhava, and my deficiency of love for Sri Sri Radha-Gopinath. But one thing I possess gives me hope—my unbroken faith in you. I know that by sincerely surrendering to you and striving my best, one day I will attain everything.\n\nI promise to try my utmost to chant my sixteen rounds with full attention, to serve consciously, to remember you and Radha-Gopinath in all my actions, and to remain sensitive and harmonious with all Vaishnavas. I will do my best to please my authorities, avoid prajalpa, and stay away from anything that may displease you or hinder my bhakti.\n\nWhatever offenses I have committed in the past, I beg for your forgiveness at your lotus feet. Please accept me, Gurudev. Without you, I have no one. I offer you all my love, awe, and reverence. Kindly give me shelter under your lotus feet forever.\n\nPlease never leave me.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nKrish Jain"

Though I’m not qualified to glorify a pure devotee like you, Maharaj, with your kind permission, I’d like to humbly offer a few words for my own purification.\n \n You are an ocean of divine and auspicious qualities, Maharaj. It is because of your causeless mercy and boundless compassion that a fallen conditioned soul like me got this most precious opportunity to take shelter at your lotus feet.\n \n The amount of austerities you have undertaken over the last 55+ years are beyond my comprehension. With my limited intelligence, I struggle to understand as to how you have undergone immense sacrifices and tapasya in your unalloyed dedication to fulfilling, carrying out, and manifesting Srila Prabhupada’s vision. Your tireless and heartfelt efforts to spread Krsna Consciousness throughout the world, especially in the West, are very inspiring, Maharaj. You are indeed so very dear to Srimati Radharani and Lord Krsna, and you have been sent by Them. Your deep absorption in every activity you perform, along with your love and care for the devotees and for all living beings across all species, are manifestations of the highest and purest devotion you offer to the Supreme Lord.\n \n Thank you, Maharaj, for blessing us with thousands and thousands of nectarian Krsna Katha and Gaura Katha. You have poured your heart and soul into these lectures, and every sentence you speak carries such weight and significance because of your exemplary and glorious life of living those principles and your deep realizations of the philosophy. By your personal example, you constantly emphasize the importance of serving Lord Chaitanya’s movement in the humble mood of the servant of the servant of the servant. With such deep humility and unflinching determination, you have not only gloriously led the movement but you have also created and empowered leaders who in turn continue to create and empower other leaders. We are truly fortunate and grateful to have the association and guidance of your dear disciples such as HG Gauranga Prabhu, HG Radheshyam Prabhu, HG Vraja Bihari Prabhu, HG Chaitanya Charan Prabhu, and HG Gauranga Darshan Prabhu, to name a few.\n \n On this auspicious day, I beg at your lotus feet to please forgive me for the offenses I may have committed through my thoughts, words, or actions, and to please grant me strength and intelligence so that I may not commit such offenses in the future. I sincerely pray that I can remember, imbibe, and live the instructions you have given to us. I beg at your lotus feet for your blessings to make progress in the path of Krsna consciousness. I pray that I can maintain and increase the eagerness to attentively chant the holy names. I pray that I can serve some tiny purpose in your mission by engaging in the service of the Vaishnavas in the humble mood of a servant of a servant of a servant. Your prayers and blessings are the lifeline of my spiritual journey.\n \n I pray to The Lordships to bestow and shower Their choicest blessings upon you and grant you very good health.\n \n Aspiring to be your worthy disciple,\n Your insignificant servant,\n Krishna Murali Das Seattle."

        "Your Offering ":  "Dearest Gurudev,\n \n Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n As I sit to write my Vyasa Puja Offering to you, my mind goes back to the late evening in 2002 when some of us were with you at Udupi at the residence of Dayal Chandra Prabhu, and we had come to your room to see you sitting before your laptop, to see you and your laptop fully covered by thousands of small insects of all types and shapes, and you were typing something fully engrossed. Looking at our enquiring faces, you responded, \"I am finishing my Vyasa Puja offering to Srila Prabhupada, and today is the last day for submission.\" I was thinking, \"Oh my Lord! Maharaja is so much engrossed in his writing of his Vyasa Puja offering to his spiritual master that he is completely oblivious to the thousands of insects literally covering his face and his head, and maybe even biting him.\" I was completely overwhelmed by your absorption, and the same thing I observed during the daily lectures at Govardhan during the Kartik Yatra. Your shawl was literally covered with hundreds of insects, and there must have been much more buzzing around you, but you were completely oblivious to them as you were diving deep into the nectar of the holy names during Kirtan and pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu during your classes. I pray at your lotus feet, Gurudev, please shower me with a drop of this absorption in the holy names and the pastimes of the Lord.\n \n It was at the same residence of Dayal Chandra Prabhu that one morning when we came to your room, we could see that you had barely slept the whole night, and as soon as we settled into your room, you said, \"Have I come to Udupi to die? I was kept awake the whole night because of the dogs barking. This is so very disturbing. Let us go back to Bombay immediately.\" We all panicked, and then we told you that we had alternative accommodation a few kilometers away which you should please try for a couple of days and then decide. Fortunately, that house was much more peaceful, and you settled down to a couple of weeks of rest and peace.\n \n We are extremely grateful to you, Gurudev, for all that you are giving us: all the love and affection, the devotee association, the ever-increasing bliss of participating in yatras with all the devotees, and of course, the home that you had made for us at Govardhan Eco Village. I was struck by your two words, \"Welcome Home,\" during the opening of Govardhan Kunj, after which you gave us a very elaborate purport and then once again concluded with the words, \"Welcome Home.\" Of course, this was not the first time we had heard these two words. You have repeated to us these two words again and again over the last twelve years since you got involved with the development of Govardhan Eco Village to drive home the point that this is your home, and it is yours for your taking. What a great fortune you have created for us!!!! This project is touching the hearts of each and everyone who comes here and creating lasting memories in their lives.\n \n Once you made Govardhan Eco Village the oasis that it is to the worldwide congregation of ISKCON devotees, you turned your mind to Radha Gopinath Temple once again, and I remember the conversation that we had on Janmashtami day of 2024 when a few of us were sitting with you in the courtyard. You were relaxed and peaceful, and in a very casual way, you remarked, \"Radha Gopinath temple is the parent of all the temples that have emerged through the efforts of the brahmacaris and congregation so very naturally, you did not include yourself in this, and how can we have it any less beautiful than any of the other temples? The kitchen is so shabby, and it needs to be completely refurbished, and so do Bhaktivedanta Hall and Bhakti Siddhanta Hall. It would be so wonderful if we had stone cladding in building numbers 1 and 2 so that we can have a proper synergy between the temple building and the two buildings by its side.\" You told us how you would like the Laxmi Narayan Courtyard to be renovated, and it was on this day of Janmashtami that you said that the Laxmi Narayan Deities should be named as Sri Sri Radha Paitha Bihari, and with a hearty laugh, gave us the purport with the pastime of Lord Vishnu having his two extra hands disappear due to the love of Shrimati Radharani at Paitha.\n \n We are seeing so many miracles taking place on the eve of your 75th appearance. Flats in Radha Gopinath Mandir where we have been having court cases going on for years with no end in sight were miraculously getting settled out of court with the tenants themselves coming forward with reasonable requests for settlement, and many, many more which I am not able to spell out here. On this most joyous occasion of the 75th appearance of Your Divine Grace, I pray at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, our parampara, and Sri Radha Gopinathji to give you a long and wonderful life ahead in the service of your loving Spiritual Master, Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, and continue to be a beacon of hope in this miserable material world to thousands of more Vaishnavas to bring them to the lotus feet of Shrimati Radharani.\n \n Your servant,\n \n Krishna Naam das"

She is so pure and humble, who guided me everything and gave me the shelter of Guru and Gauranga, and everything I am getting by her mercy only 🥹🙇‍♀️.\n \n I do not have many words and intelligence to glorify your unlimited divine qualities, Guru Maharaj, but I am begging for your mercy.

We pray falling at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Madhav, Giriraj Govardhan, Jagannatha Baladev Subhadra Mai and Nitai Gaura Sundar to shower their choicest blessings upon you.\n \n We are very grateful and indebted to you for accepting us as your disciples though we are utterly unqualified.\n \n We feel very fortunate being in the Washington, DC area as you visit this area frequently and we are blessed to get your darshan and association. This year, we are more fortunate as you visited Baltimore ISKCON temple and we got good fortune to serve you lunch prasadam. Please forgive us if we have committed any offenses at your lotus feet while serving you.\n \n I was reading HG Vrindavan Das prabhuji’s “Guru Smaran” book where he mentioned many of his memories with you.\n In one incident, he tells of your great quality of humbleness and always considering yourself as a servant of the servant of the Supreme Lord.\n One time, a devotee family was talking to you in the temple. They also had a servant with them whom they brought from their village to help them in their household duties.\n You asked them who she was, and they mentioned that she is their servant. Then you mentioned to them that you are her servant.\n HG Vrindavan Das prabhuji mentions through this incident your humbleness and always having the mood of a servant of the servant of the Supreme Lord.\n \n In another incident, Prabhuji talks about your tolerance.\n 1. Once, when Guru Maharaj went to Belgum, Vrindavan Das Pr arranged 5 programs in 1 day.\n 2. In the morning, after the SB class was over, Guru Maharaj got up from the Vyasasana.\n 3. Then Vrindavan Das Pr noticed blood marks on the Vyasasana and also similar marks on Guru Maharaj’s dhoti.\n 4. Then he informed Maharaj about these blood marks.\n 5. Then Maharaj pulled his dhoti a little and showed a big boil that had burst. Due to that, blood and pus came out.\n 6. But Maharaj was so tolerant that he continued his SB class without any complaint.\n 7. After that class, Vrindavan Das Pr took him to an Ayurvedic doctor who cleaned and applied a bandage. He also gave some medicine for the pain.\n 8. Though Maharaj had this bodily issue, he still continued with preaching in all the other 4 programs.\n It shows Maharaj’s tolerance and his enthusiasm or compassion to preach or share this wonderful knowledge with others.\n \n In one more incident, he mentions about your absorption in Krishna Katha.\n 1. One time, when Guru Maharaj was giving a lecture in one of the devotee’s bungalows, outside in the garden.\n 2. His Vyasasana was arranged under a big mango tree and Maharaj started giving the lecture.\n 3. At some point, a mango fell down from the tree onto the head of Guru Maharaj and bounced in front of the devotees.\n 4. A few devotees rushed to take that mango fruit, considering it as Maha prasadam of Guru Maharaj.\n 5. Within a few minutes, there was a bump on Maharaj’s head due to the mango fruit falling from 20 feet high onto his head.\n 6. After the program was over, HG Vrindavan Das Pr mentioned to Guru Maharaj about the bump on his head.\n 7. Then Maharaj asked him how it happened. Then Prabhuji narrated what happened.\n 8. It shows Maharaj’s great absorption in Kirtan or Krishna Katha that he was not aware of the damage that had happened to his body.\n 9. If a person like me, then I would be crying or shouting with pain. Mostly I would have cancelled the rest of the program also.\n \n Hearing your glories from all these pastimes inspires me to progress in the path of Bhakti. I have many anarthas in my heart sitting very strongly and I am unable to control my mind from materialistic activities. Though I theoretically understand that if I don’t ignore my mind and don’t surrender to Guru \u0026 Krishna, then my miseries will continue birth after birth. But I am extremely weak in front of my mind.\n \n So, on this auspicious occasion, I pray at your lotus feet to shower your mercy and blessings so that I can try to engage my mind sincerely in Krishna consciousness and develop Brahmanical qualities.\n \n Also, we would like to thank you for everything that you have given to us and beg your prayers so that we will be able to serve your lotus feet and Srila Prabhupada’s mission.\n \n Trying to be your servant of servant,\n Krishna Venu Das \u0026 Jai Lalita Devi Dasi\n Elkridge, Maryland, USA."

You travelled to every corner of India. During that time you met different types of Gurus, each shining with their own light of knowledge. At such a young age you spent time with all kinds of Gurus, whether happily or painfully, but you never accepted anyone as your Guru; you neither disrespected anyone nor pointed out anyone\u0027s mistakes. You respected everyone from the heart, saw their good qualities, and learnt something or the other from them.\n\nBut when the time came, you chose Shrila Prabhupada as your Gurudev. And from then till today, you are following his instructions; the ideal of how to become a devoted disciple is before us. You not only loved Srila Prabhupada but you also give so much respect to his disciples and your God brothers and God sisters that they too feel overwhelmed while receiving your respect and honour.\n\nGurudev, you are a storehouse of love and humility. You give the same love in abundance to living beings like us. That is why today we all are here. You keep showering your love on us and you become very happy seeing us happy.\n\nGurudev, a small example is when you take us on a Yatra, you make arrangements for our every happiness and at the end of the day when you conduct Hari Naam Sankirtan in the pandal, you cry out to Krishna, and we just shout after you. But not seeing any of our shortcomings, you become very happy, and seeing that, we also feel very happy.\n\nGurudev, in today\u0027s Kalyug, whoever makes someone a Guru, the Guru keeps changing. But on this holy day, give me a drop of your Guru loyalty and devotion as alms, so that till the last breath of my life, I remain dedicated to your lotus feet and remain engaged in service under the guidance of the devotees.\n\nsakti-buddhi-hin, ami ati din, koro’ more atma-satha\nThank you very much\nYour unworthy servant\nKrishna Leela Devi Dasi."

While most devotees were joyfully relishing prasāda and association, I saw you quietly sitting under a tree, absorbed in preparing your class — meditating deeply on the leelās of Lord which you would soon speak. The sight struck me profoundly.\n\nThat moment revealed your heart — your total absorption in service to your Guru and the Lord. It showed how your every breath, every thought, and every moment is centered on glorifying the Lord and nourishing your disciples.

By listening to your lectures, I started to chant my rounds more attentively and seriously; I started reading books more deeply, and the most important thing that happened to me is that I started taking studies seriously.\n \n By your lectures, I realized that my studies are my service to the Lord, and the fruit of my studies can be a very sweet gift and an asset in the service of the Lord.\n \n Exactly three years ago, on 15th November 2022, I took a vow to give my best to achieve a top position in the PG entrance exam, which is now almost just 8 months away. Since that day, I try my best to daily remember the instructions given by you in your lectures to be focused towards my aim and be enthusiastic despite many obstacles and provoking and depressing situations.\n \n Since then, many situations have come where I almost quit the path of bhakti, but by your mercy and guidance through your lectures and your devotees, I am still going on with faith that I can do something for this mission.\n \n I was born into darkness, Maharaj. You have come into my life and have illuminated everything in order for me to see things clearly and go ahead.\n Thank you, Maharaj.\n \n I\u0027ll give my 201% to reach the spot I am aspiring for, in order that I can use it in the service of the Lord and devotees.\n \n Your aspiring servant,\n Kuldeep Chaudhari."

        "Your Offering ":  "Dearest Gurudev,\n\nPlease accept my most humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet. All glories to you, and all glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nOn this sacred occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja, my heart overflows with gratitude and remembrance. I am reflecting on those golden days of my childhood at the Matunga program, when you would shower everyone with your warm, affectionate hugs. Those moments were filled with a sweetness and purity that words can hardly capture.\nI still remember how lovingly you would tap or punch my forehead. It always felt like a “reset button” that instantly cleared all my worries. And when you would wrap me in your saffron shawl, though nothing else was visible, it felt as if I was completely protected, sheltered under your love and care.\nAs children, we didn’t realize the immense fortune we had of being in your presence, receiving your blessings. We were too absorbed in our little games of cricket, not recognizing that the greatest treasure of our lives was right before us. Now, as I look back, I realize how precious those moments were, a golden opportunity that I did not value enough then.\nI also feel deeply grateful for the mercy you have showered upon my parents and sister. Whatever little spiritual inclination and values I have today are only because of the association and guidance you have so kindly given to them. You have not only transformed their hearts but also given our entire family a purpose and direction centered around Krishna. The care and compassion you have shown to them over the years is something I can never repay.\nOver the years, so many things have changed in ways I could have never imagined. This year’s Kartik Yatra I attended after 11 long years, which felt like a forgotten blessing returning to life. There was a time when I couldn’t even think of missing a single Yatra, and would attend all Sunday programs in a year at the temple, and now, even to attend one in a year feels like a rare and precious gift.\nToday, I feel deeply unfortunate to be living away from your heart, Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji, and to be deprived of your direct mercy. Yet, as you have taught us, I continue to have faith that somehow, by following your instructions, I may be of some use in Srila Prabhupada’s divine mission. Your teachings, your example, and your compassion constantly inspire me to stay steady on the spiritual path and not to deviate, no matter how challenging life becomes.\nI am also very grateful for the kindness and inspiration you have shown to my wife, Kirti Sundari Devi Dasi, and our daughter, Vrindapriya. Whatever little harmony and spiritual strength we have in our family is purely by your grace. You have given us the understanding that family life can also be centered around devotion, service, and gratitude. I pray that our home may always remain connected to your lotus feet and that we may serve your mission together with sincerity and humility.\nWe hanker for your darshan like the chataka bird hankers for the pure raindrops from the sky, with the same intense longing and hope. On this auspicious day, I sincerely pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji to bless you with strong health, vitality, and endless strength to continue spreading the divine message of Lord Krishna, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Srila Prabhupada to the world.\nAnd, Gurudev, I have one small, childlike prayer: please, at least once a year, bless me with one of your loving hugs. That single embrace has the power to dissolve all my suffering and remind me that I am forever under your shelter.\n\nAwaiting for the drop of your mercy and that loving hug,\n\nYour eternal servants,\nKumar Sundar Das, Kirti Sundari Devi Dasi, \u0026 Vrindapriya"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna, dear Maharaj. Please accept my most humble obeisances.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to your divine service.\n \n On the auspicious occasion of your divine appearance day, I am trying to offer a few words from my insignificant heart.\n \n For me, you are truly one of the great pioneers of Srila Prabhupada’s Hare Krishna movement in this world. Through your tireless efforts, compassion, and unwavering faith, you have carried Srila Prabhupada’s message to countless hearts. I feel immensely grateful and fortunate to accept you as my śikṣā-guru and to look up to you as my guardian and guide in spiritual life.\n \n After my beloved spiritual master, His Holiness Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj, departed from this world last year, I was feeling completely lost and orphaned. But just before leaving, Gurudev instructed us to take shelter of a senior Vaiṣṇava in our movement. Following that instruction, the only person my heart naturally turned towards was Your Holiness. Somehow, by your causeless mercy, I have always felt a deep connection with you for many years through your lectures and Hari-kathā, and that connection has only grown stronger since Gurudev’s departure.\n \n By Srila Prabhupada’s and Guru Maharaj’s mercy, I had the great fortune of receiving your darśan twice—once last year and once again at the beginning of this year. You were so merciful, Maharaj: you not only gave your darśan but also spoke a few kind words to me. In those moments, I strongly felt in my heart that my Guru Maharaj wanted me to take shelter of you, his dear Godbrother. I feel very, very blessed to be somehow associated with Your Holiness.\n \n I am endlessly grateful that we have an unlimited treasure of your lectures, kirtans, and recordings available to us. Because of this, I can daily increase my śravaṇam and hear Hari-kathā from you, even without being in your physical presence. Your Vāṇī gives me strength and guidance at every step and allows me to feel your association wherever I am.\n \n Maharaj, you have completely transformed my heart and vision. Earlier, although I was practicing Krishna consciousness externally, internally I was in darkness. I was very judgmental and critical, always searching for faults in devotees and proudly thinking that I alone was following the standards properly. But by observing your profound humility, your genuine respect for every devotee, and your deep compassion, over time I began to realize how wrong I was.\n \n I especially remember one pastime narrated by HG Gaurang Prabhu: when some brahmacārīs came to you and complained about their fellow brahmacārīs not practicing properly, you did not encourage their fault-finding mentality. Instead, you began to speak about the good qualities of those devotees. You taught them to see the positive side of others, to take what is good, and to learn from that, rather than criticizing and trying to bring others down.\n \n Through such examples, you are teaching all of us how to truly live the mood of tṛṇād api sunīcena and amāninā mānadena. If there is anyone in this movement from whom I wish to learn real humility, genuine respect for others, and the art of not finding faults in devotees, it is you, Śrīla Radhanath Swami Maharaj. For this, I am forever indebted and grateful to you, Gurudev.\n \n From the core of my heart, I offer my repeated thanks to you, dear Maharaj. I address you as Guru Maharaj because, in terms of tattva, guru is one, and I feel such deep connection, guidance, and shelter coming from you. I feel that my Guru Maharaj, His Holiness Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj, continues to live in his Vāṇī and also through you—his dear most Godbrother who always had so much love, honor, and respect for him. When I see you, I am reminded of him, and I feel that in serving your instructions, I am also serving his desire.\n \n On this sacred day of your appearance, I offer my heartfelt prayers at the lotus feet of\n Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Śyāmasundar,\n Śrī Śrī Kṛṣṇa-Balarām,\n Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nitāi,\n Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva,\n and at the lotus feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda,\n that They kindly keep you healthy, strong, and protected, so that we may have your association and guidance for many more years to come. Your presence in this world is a great hope for fallen souls like me.\n \n I also humbly pray at your lotus feet, Maharaj, that you kindly bestow your mercy upon my younger sister and accept her as your disciple. The only aim of my life is that she may find complete shelter at your lotus feet and be delivered by your causeless mercy. If you accept her, I will consider my life successful.\n \n श्रीराधानाथप्रभुपादशिष्यपदपद्मसेवाभिरतोऽस्तु नित्यं ।\n यस्याङ्घ्रिपद्मानुगताः पवित्रे पादुके मम चित्तमाश्रयन्तु ॥\n \n “May I be forever devoted to the lotus feet of Śrī Rādhānātha Svāmī, the dear disciple of Śrīla Prabhupāda, and may his holy pādukās, which follow those lotus feet, dwell in my heart.”\n \n Thank you so much, dear Maharaj, for everything. I remain always,\n Your eternally grateful and insignificant servant,\n \n Kurma Anadi Das\n ISKCON Jalandhar\n Hopefully aspiring to serve at your lotus feet"

I have understood that I may never get the opportunity to meet you in person, but whenever I hear from other devotees describing your wonderful pastimes in this material world, I am immediately reminded of the great fortune I have received.\n You have saved me from falling into maya many times. As soon as you had accepted me as your disciple, I could get transferred to Kolkata where I am able to do my part in fulfilling your dream by assisting in establishing a temple in the Newtown area. Due to your mercy only, we can serve in the birthplace of Srila Prabhupada and become instruments in your hands to assist you in your service to your Guru Maharaj.\n You are one of the most powerful Acharyas of our Parampara in today’s era who has awakened the lamp of Krishna Consciousness in the hearts of millions of people of this world, which is evident from the number of devotees coming every year in your Kartik Yatra. You had tolerated so much for giving us Krishna Consciousness. Today, I am reminded of the austerities you performed in New Vrindavan just to obey the orders of your superiors. I can only imagine the pain your body went through while carrying out that seemingly impossible service. I can never think of myself being in such a situation. So, I pray that you can bless me to have the same obedience to my superiors as you had.\n I am also very inspired by the absorption you have in the pastimes of Krishna in Vrindavan. Though you are a sanyasi and practically you have nothing in your bank account, but you have only one treasure, and that is your heart. It is so invaluable that Krishna has stolen it; therefore you said that Krishna attracted your heart like no one else. So much so that when once you were having very high fever, you went into delirium and started babbling the pastimes of Krishna in Vrindavan. So, your whole consciousness is totally immersed in the mood of a Brajvasi. I pray at your lotus feet to give me the blessing that I can also get absorbed in your mood and thus perfect this life.\n I am a statue of faults, and I am under the control of my mind and senses. I don’t have any hope to come out of this material world. Therefore, I am just begging for your mercy. Please be merciful upon me and give me a few drops of your love for Sri Sri Radha Madhav and Nitai Gauranga.\n \n Radhanath Swami, please\n Make me like your honeybees.\n Let me just see good in all,\n Never cherish someone’s fall.\n Let me only seek essence,\n Everywhere His presence.\n As I see the passing days,\n May I always feel your grace.\n \n  -Your servant,\n  Kushal Bihari Das"

All glories to you.\n \n Gurudeva, in my life, time and again I witness how fortunate I am to be under your shelter. Every moment living is fully a mercy for me; this I realized more in this year.\n Back in 2023 during Radhashtami, I got to know that you are in India. I came to the temple with a lot of questions, whether or not you are my spiritual master. Then, by Radharani\u0027s mercy, I got an opportunity to serve for designing her dupatta, and after that, I got very personal darshans of yours. At that moment, I decided you are my spiritual master, which got stronger by one of the lectures by Radharani mataji on your vyas puja. Gurudeva, after that day, I realized how important seva is. Throughout this journey, I got so much nourishment from all your senior disciples, which increased my faith and love for you. Gurudeva, I only pray that may I have the qualities of your sincere disciples who serve you without any ulterior motive and serve you with great love.\n There were few reciprocations of devotees with you which was very personal; it was shared with me, and I was very happy for them, as the loving exchange was so pure and deep to the heart. The next day, I had a dream in which you told me two things:\n 1. You already have it.\n 2. Always prioritize others before you.\n These two things I will never forget, Gurudeva, and always follow.\n This year, after watching Mahavtar Narsimha, I realized a lot of things and can see the mood which you always share.\n \n asprihya va pada-ratam pinashtu mam\n adarshanan marma-hatam karotu va\n yatha tatha va vidadhatu lampato\n mat-prana-nathas tu sa eva naparaha\n \n May I make this my life and soul.\n When you were in Italy, I started to read \"The Journey Home\" as a letter from you every day, and the reciprocations which you gave me were very personal. I felt deep separation from you at that time. In one of the lectures, one mataji told this: \"If you remember your guru, he will be right with you, and serving his instructions are like associating with him.\" Gurudeva, I really don\u0027t know what is my capacity to serve you, but I really want to serve all the Vaishnavas and you without any duplicity.\n This year you called me to Vrindavan, Govardhan. The glories of Vrindavan are so amazing and mystical, and as Srila Prabhupada said, you can\u0027t go to Vrindavan just by booking a ticket. Gurudeva, I realized this; whatever happened in Govardhan was purely and purely your mercy.\n After returning, my life changed in a very different way which I never expected. I was able to survive this whole time only for you. Remembering you at all these hard phases and that assurance that you are there for me was my only hope.\n I always want to come to you in every situation because you are my only shelter.\n I always want to be attached to you, Gurudeva. I know you hold my hand so tightly; please let me not leave your hand in any situation.\n And finally, the day came when You returned to India. The day when everything was so magical and unreal. From morning 6 am, we all were engaged in decorating Radha Gopinath and shops.\n The feeling of finally, after months, this separation is going to end, and the happiness of decorating our Home with all the devotees was so special. You were so happy after seeing all of this, and that glance of yours when I offered you a rose gave all the assurance whether you knew what all happened and how much I missed you.\n Next day, October 12th, in your Sunday class, this class was so personal to me, and you answered all my questions. The moment when you said paramātmā is always with you, it is right beside you and will never leave you... and GURU IS THAT EXPANSION OF PARAMĀTMĀ! You revealed this exactly what I wanted to hear. Your desperation to take me more close to Radha Gopinath and always serve the devotees are always a reminder for me to become better day by day. During Srila Prabhupada\u0027s disappearance day, I intensely prayed to him that you are very dear to Srila Prabhupada, and your commitment towards his instructions is so strong; may I also have the same commitment towards your instructions and make them my life and soul.\n \n The love which you hold for all your God brothers and God sisters is so pure and unconditional; this increased my attachment towards all the Prabhupada disciples. Your Gauralila series is so filled with love and instructions; may I inculcate and understand the mood you hold. Hearing your lectures is like associating with you. I have taken some sankalpas for your vyas puja; bless me for properly fulfilling them, and this brings me more close to you and Radha Gopinath and serves all the devotees with great love.\n \n After experiencing many things in this year, I realized this is not the place where I actually belong to. Even in the devotee community, love and compassion are very much needed. The perspective which you gave me to hold the good things and leave the bad things back. Each and every individual is so special and dear to Radha Gopinath and you, whether they are connected to ISKCON or not. I\u0027ll always remember this and try to serve them to my fullest.\n Gurudeva, may I always be attached to you and only you, expecting nothing from anyone. Please make me humble and compassionate for serving you and all the devotees.\n \n Aspiring to be the servant of the servant,\n \n Lakitha\n Mumbai"

May I also have the same commitment towards your instructions and make them my life and soul.\n \n The love which you hold for all your God brothers and God sisters is so pure and unconditional. This increased my attachment towards all the Prabhupada disciples. Your Gaura Lila series is so filled with love and instructions. May I inculcate and understand the mood you hold. Hearing your lectures is like associating with you. I have taken some sankalpas for your vyas puja. Bless me for properly fulfilling them, and this brings me more close to you and Radha-Gopinath and allows me to serve all the devotees with great love.\n \n After experiencing many things this year, I realized this is not the place where I actually belong to. Even in the devotee community, love and compassion are very much needed. The perspective which you gave me to hold the good things and leave the bad things back. Each and every individual is so special and dear to Radha-Gopinath and you, whether they are connected to ISKCON or not. I will always remember this and try to serve them to my fullest.\n Gurudeva, may I always be attached to you and only you, expecting nothing from anyone. Please make me humble and compassionate for serving you and all the devotees.\n \n \n Aspiring to be the servant of the servant,\n \n Lakitha\n Mumbai"

They are just like desire trees who can fulfill the desires of everyone, and they are full of compassion for the fallen conditioned souls.\n \n I don\u0027t know where I should start from, because I am so in debt to Srila Radhanath Swami Maharaj. Maharaj is an individual who has changed the way I look at this material creation. I used to think that all the jivas other than devotees are nonsense. I had no compassion for people in general, but as I started to hear Maharaji\u0027s lectures, I realized that there is a great sense of gratitude Maharaji holds for everything, and at the same time he is compassionate, merciful, selfless, etc., towards every single living entity. What to talk about non-devotees, he is even very compassionate to each and every being, whether in the body of an animal or anything else.\n \n Maharaj is an ocean of mercy; he is filled with Love of Godhead.\n When I started reading THE JOURNEY HOME, it was a humbling experience, and knowing that Maharaj has gone through so much is soul-enlightening. The book \"Journey Home\" extremely decreased my critical nature towards the world.\n The way you deal with your disciples sometimes is like you are cutting their false ego.\n Your lectures have made me a bit humble and increased my service attitude.\n \n Maharaj, I pray to you and beg at your lotus feet to please bless me so that I cooperate with devotees and serve SRILA PRABHUPADA. I beg that I see positivity only, even in non-devotees.\n Oh SRILA SHIKSHA GURU, please cut my false ego again and again. Please cut my bodily concept in such a way that I beg for the blessings of vaishnavas again and again.\n Please cut my attachment to my senses in such a way that they only hanker for Krishna.\n \n I beg at your lotus feet that I remain humble and give all respect to others and not expect anything in return.\n SRILA SHIKSHA GURU, I beg again and again that I take your instructions to heart.\n \n Please, Maharaj, I do not have a tinge of desire to surrender to SRILA PRABHUPADA.\n \n Someday, maybe, I would be able to write this offering unto your lotus feet with some attachment to your lotus feet.\n Your Servant,\n Laksh"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna dear Guru Maharaj November 11th, 2025\n Please accept my deepest obeisances. All glories to our most beloved Srila Prabhupada!\n \n Not a day goes by that I do not think of you or dream of you. I was still fortunate enough to meet you in person this year in Villa Vrindavana. Oh, what a joy it is to be in your *vapuh* association and the association of all my god-brothers and sisters. The heart jumps in joy to be able to sit directly at your feet and listen to your exposition of Krishna *katha*. It’s an extra perk and privilege in my life to see you in person. I have also just finished watching your Govardhana Kartik Yatra. I felt so deeply in your presence, as if I was one of those 12 thousand devotees there. Often when you spoke, tears would come to my eyes to see the magnitude of your preaching and the impact it has on us all. And here we are trying to canvas you to come to visit us in Radhadesh with only 120 devotees. Are we out of line, I wonder?\n \n Even though your *vapuh* association is so precious to me, I don\u0027t feel separated from you, as I carry you in my heart throughout the day. We have recently finished studying the 3rd Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam in our Bhakti-vaibhava study group here in Radhadesh. There, in the verse 3.25.21, Kapila Muni explains the characteristics of a *sadhu* to his mother Devahuti. The line *suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām* caught my attention, and I went on a small journey of discovery, diving deep into this topic, which I then developed into a small presentation for my fellow study-buddies. I learned that there are different levels of friendships, and they are represented by different Sanskrit terms: from *bandhu*, *mitra/sakha*, *priya-sakha*, all the way to *suhṛt*. *Suhṛt* is one in a million, a friend who never lets you down, who loves you unconditionally, who is there with you no matter what, who always makes time for you, and who never judges you. He walks with you till you reach your goal. This friendship is so deep that many times words do not need to be expressed for the other to understand. It’s such a rare bond, which is hard to achieve, and not every person may be fortunate to get a friend of this level throughout their life. *Suhṛt* is your best well-wisher. The conclusion of this presentation was that I feel extremely fortunate. Meeting devotees has opened the door for me to finally meet my *suhrts*. To meet Krishna as my *suhrt*, to get Srila Prabhupada as a *suhrt*, having you as my unique *suhrt*, and to have my husband, Visnu Murti, as my *suhrt*. These are four principal persons in my life who want to see me succeed on this journey of life and death.\n \n This deeper study of just this one line of Srimad-Bhagavatam has been very revealing for me; it left a profound impression on my heart, and it certainly brought a deeper understanding of who a *sadhu* is, and how Srila Prabhupada has pushed himself into our lives to take us out of this world of *kunta*. This is who a *sadhu* is: the best well-wishing friend of all. You are this *suhrt* to me, Guru Maharaj. So close to my heart that I don\u0027t feel separated from you.\n \n I bow down to you with utter gratitude and pray for the qualities and abilities for being able to assist you and serve you in your service to Srila Prabhupada’s mission, that you can be proud of.\n Your aspiring servant\n Laksmipriya dd"

Our children were of school-going age.\n15 and 12. We were staying just a kilometer from Sri Sri Radha Gopinath temple, at Grant Road West.\n\nLalitha Priya was attending Mangal Aarti daily from mid-1994 and would leave after Tulsi Aarti. At home, my father was perturbed seeing our growing involvement in the temple activities. He said, \"I am not against God or religion, but against the institutionalization of religion. 10 or 20 minutes is all it takes to pray; the rest of the time should be for children and business.\" Of course, we were not neglecting our duties, but our engagement in the temple activities was steadily rising.\n\nLike we see in movies, when everything was just fine according to us, he felt we were going overboard. He ordered us to go and stay at a spare flat we had at Dahisar, almost 50 kilometers away. Our concern was the children\u0027s schooling. We were in a fix. Our counselor, HG Adikeshav Prabhu, brought us to you and said, \"They have become dear to Krishna.\" I was puzzled. He explained the situation to you.\n\nYou just thought it over for a minute and said, \"You go by your father\u0027s instruction. It will be better for your spiritual life.\" It was a tough choice. Your guidance gave us strength, and we went ahead. Daily, we brought our children to school and attended the temple too.

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisance at your lotus feet.\n All glories to you, all glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n The vyasapuja offering means glorification of the spiritual master. Actually, the disciple\u0027s only strength is contemplating the glories of a spiritual master. That is the only saving grace for the disciple. Otherwise, he has to glorify Maya. The disciple receives mercy from the spiritual master through his instructions and conducts his life by that instruction, then he will get realization. So, the vyasapuja day is an opportunity to share that realization with the spiritual master, so that the spiritual master will be pleased. When the spiritual master is pleased, then the disciple\u0027s spiritual life will be successful. Yasya prasadat bhagavat prasado, yasya prasada na gati ki topi.\n \n Guru Maharaj, the more I am hearing from different sources, the more I am able to understand the importance of the association of sadhus. Without hearing from a sadhu, one cannot understand the glories of devotional service. That is why the Vedas are called Shruti. The purpose of Vedic literature is to awaken the relationship with Krishna. But it should be understood by hearing from a pure devotee. Even though I am not able to get your physical association, through your different lectures like S.B. Classes or yatras or seminars, by your teachings, I am able to see and connect to Krishna through my life, or to this world. Without approaching the sadhu or hearing from him, human life is meaningless. Srila Prabhupada, in every purport, he mentioned that one should approach a bonafide spiritual master and hear from him and follow his instructions.\n \n Guru Maharaj, I am experiencing that unless one comes to the association of sadhus, his real spiritual life will not begin. One may be very austere, one may be very expert in Vedic literature, one may be very pious, still, one must approach a sadhu. In the present situation, people are not very austere, not very inquisitive, and not interested in reading scriptures, but they want to see role models in society. It means by seeing an exemplary person, one may become interested in spiritual life, then they will approach a sadhu. You are one of the exemplary sadhus to this world. Recently, in the Kartik yatra, devotees from all over the world came to Guriraj Govardhan just to take association from you and hear from you. All types of devotees are children, youth, old, and women. Just by seeing you, people think that here is a religious person; he brings us to a spiritual platform. Actually, your lifestyle and your speech are most important to this society. Just by seeing you and hearing from you, they will connect to God and they will be happy. The six days during the yatra, we completely forgot our household activities, our material life, and all our domestic activities. You made us absorbed hearing about the Lord, worshipping the Lord, taking darshan of the Lord, and engaging in the service of the Lord. We felt so happy. You showed us during this yatra how we can live our whole life in the association of devotees and at the same time how to live in this world. You said that the actual yatra begins after we leave, during this 6-day yatra. So, this is how I am understanding the importance of sadhus, Maharaj.\n \n Guru Maharaj, you left home from your childhood, you left your most loving parents, you left the worshipable land, and you met so many babas, saints, renouncers, and you met many monks, just to find a guru. To meet a genuine sadhu, you did so much austerity in your life. You walk towards a sadhu, but Krishna walks towards a sadhu like you. You reached the lotus feet of a pure devotee, that is Srila Prabhupada, and Srila Prabhupada gave you the holydham of Goloka Vrindavan. Guru Maharaj, you came to India to give the association of sadhus; Srila Prabhupada went to America to teach the value of saintly person association to people in general.\n \n Guru Maharaj, your heart is filled with the glories of Srila Prabhupada. Whatever you do, whatever you speak, and all your actions are representative of Srila Prabhupada. The success of a person in spiritual life is attached to sadhus. Acharya also says that to become a sadhu, one should associate with sadhus. To become a pure devotee, one should associate with pure devotees. It is always touching my heart that in all your lectures, there is a glorification of Srila Prabhupada. That is how you are feeling grateful and how you are blessed by Srila Prabhupada and all the Acharyas in the disciplic succession. In the same way, you are teaching me how I should be grateful in the association of your lotus feet and rendering some service to your lotus feet.\n \n Regularly hearing from you, I am able to experience the happiness that comes from pure devotional service. Krishna consciousness is such a blissful process one can experience in the beginning itself. In other processes, it is only fruitless labor. A person may follow different religions, one may be very austere, he may be a much-influenced person, he may be a very scholarly person, he may worship different demigods, but unless one comes to the association of a pure devotee, he will not be successful. In the association of a pure devotee, one can be protected by Maya, one can be happy, one can understand the relationship with Krishna, and one can develop love for Krishna. In the association of a pure devotee only, one can be free from sinful activity. I am very grateful to you, Maharaj; by your causeless mercy, today I am able to understand the glories of Srila Prabhupada.\n \n A true sadhu always exhibits all the qualities in all circumstances. From his point of view, there is no good or bad, pain \u0026 pleasures, heat and cold, and happiness \u0026 distress. Just by seeing you, one will develop all these qualities. Darshana Pavitra koro-ei tomara guna. Actually, a sadhu is living Bhagavata. Just by hearing from you, just by serving you, one will understand the book Bhagavata. A living bhagavata and book bhagavata will give only qualities and devotion. I am experiencing there is no difference between book bhagavata and person bhagavata. When I contemplate all your qualities, my heart moves to devotional service. Bhagavatam explains about the Mrigari hunter. Just by association with Narada Muni, he became such a wonderful saint. There are so many examples in the Srimad Bhagavatam. Guru Maharaj, you are like that; you are always giving challenges to become humble, but I am failing in that area. How many times have you told me, trnadapi sunechana taroriva sahisnuna, amanena manadena kirtaniya sadahari. When circumstances come in such a way, I am a victim of a false ego. As you said, the quality of a sadhu is always looking for descending mercy. That means one who is in love with his spiritual master, he can conquer anything. Sadhu means cutting the knots of the disciple. The more a disciple gives an opportunity to a sadhu by means of surrender, the more he will be free from sinful activity.\n \n Guru Maharaj, on this very auspicious occasion, I am deeply praying at your lotus feet; please give me your blessing to understand the qualities of your heart. Let me become more and more humble. Let me cooperate with everyone; this is Srila Prabhupada\u0027s desire, not to compare anyone, rather cooperate with everyone. And engage me in the service of Srila Prabhupada\u0027s mission and your lotus feet.\n \n Thank you so much, Guru Maharaja.\n \n Please forgive all my offenses at your lotus feet.\n Your insignificant aspiring servant,\n Lokeshwar Govinda dasa."

I know that my Guru Maharaj has the capacity to tolerate all the nonsense I have been doing for so long and still give me love and compassion despite my inability to serve you in the right manner. I am not attempting to be humble, but that is the true story. Having you in my life is a true privilege for me. Whenever I feel a desperate need for you, you somehow guide me through various ways, but it is my unwillingness to understand your instructions. I used to hear your previous kirtans whenever I felt emptiness in my heart, and it was immediately fulfilled. I cannot come out of your kirtan hangover even after so many days since the Yatra on Prabhupad Disappearance Day, and I wish I could have that longing for you and Krsna at some point in my life. I might not be in the league of your best disciples, but I am sure that I am one of the most blessed. Thank you, Guru Maharaj, for showing this much compassion.

You are the one who shows us the light of knowledge in the darkness of our ignorance, and we are eternally grateful for your guidance.\n \n As the years pass, we strive to understand the essence of your teachings and apply them in our lives. You so beautifully instruct us not only through your words but also by the perfect example of your life.\n \n Lord Caitanya said to Sanatana Goswami:\n \n jive daya name ruci vaisnava sevana\n iha cara dharma nahi suna sanatana\n \n “Hear, Sanatana! Kindness to all living beings, taste for the holy name, and service to Vaishnavas. Apart from these there is no other religion.”\n \n You teach us that the essence of Vaishnavism is love for Krishna, which in this world manifests through pure devotees as nama ruci, vaisnava seva, and jiva daya—taste for the holy name, service to the devotees, and mercy to all living beings. And you perfectly exemplify these three principles.\n \n Every time you have visited Italy and Slovenia and we have had the mercy to be with you, we have always felt nurtured and grateful. Although we can listen to your lectures and kirtans online, it is always a very special and uplifting experience to see you in person.\n \n Jiva daya - Accompanying you on harinam in Florence and Venice was a blissful experience, seeing you sharing Krishna’s grace. And during the Journey Home book launch in Slovenia, you charmed all the attendees and touched their hearts with your message and life story.\n \n Vaishnava seva - When you were giving darshans to the devotees from our Slovenian yatra, we always felt your love and care. This year even our teenagers appreciated it, when you encouraged them about their university studies in connection to spiritual life. In those moments, it seemed as if time stood still, and you had all the time in the world for us.\n \n Nama ruci - When you led kirtans at Villa Vrindavana and Prabhupada Desh, our hearts always melted. And when we chanted japa with you in the mornings, we felt profound spiritual peace and joy simply by being in your presence.\n \n Although you have so many disciples, meet countless important people, and guide innumerable projects, it is through these small acts of kindness that you show us that relationships at the end of the day matter most—our relationships with Lord Krishna, with the devotees, and with all living beings.\n \n On your 75th birthday, we wish you a lot of joy and happiness in your loving service to Srila Prabhupada and Krishna. We pray for your good health and that you may remain with us for many years to come, showering your love, care, and compassion upon all.

Kindly bless us.\n Maharaj, we witnessed a few incidents where we found your caring for devotees is unparalleled; at the same time, you remain completely unattached.\n Maharaj, you live a very simple life; however, you are ever overwhelmed with the highest thinking that is always Krsna conscious.\n You are exemplifying the life of Guru nistha in a very practical way. You are teaching us through your own example as a sold-out servant of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedant Swami Prabhupada.\n \n Your absorption in Sri Krishna Sankirtan is something which attracts us and entices us and inspires us to practice devotional service in the way Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Srila Prabhupada taught us.\n By the causeless mercy of Guru and Gauranga, as well as the causeless mercy of Sri Sri Radha Madanmohan, we have witnessed a few incidents where you have been completely absorbed in chanting the holy name of the Lord and describing the pure pastimes of their lordships. Irrespective of the place, be it at a special place like mana mandir, or it could be a small talk for two devotees in a small room, it is always full of pure enthusiasm, hope-giving, and prayerful. This year, 2025, on the last day of Kartik Yatra, the prayers you taught us in the lecture and the completely prayerful kirtan were simply mesmerizing at the holy foothills of Giriraj Govardhan.\n \n On this most auspicious day, we beg at your lotus feet, kindly bless us that we will be determined to follow your instructions and practice pure devotional service by giving up lethargy. While practicing devotional service, please bless us that we may be able to assist the devotees in their service to their respective spiritual masters. Please bless us that we may be able to recognize the wonderful qualities of devotees and develop relationships that are conducive to practicing Krsna consciousness.\n Please bless us that we may be able to understand with firm faith that the eternal pastimes of the Supreme Lord are eternal truth and we remain equipoised to chant the holy name of the Lord both in happiness as well as in distressed conditions of life.\n \n Gurudev! Jave taba karuna prakasha,\n Sri Gauranga lila hoye nitya tatva ei drudha viswashe.\n \n Begging for eternal shelter at your lotus feet,\n Your insignificant servants\n Madankumar Dasa\n Sakhiseva Devidasi\n Sitapriya"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna,\n Dear Gurudev, His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj,\n \n Please accept my humble obeisances.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Gurudev, wishing you a very happy KC birthday. On this auspicious day of your appearance, I wanted to thank you profusely from the bottom of my heart for accepting me and my wife as your disciples on 6th September 2024 and giving us the names Madhav Prem Das and Ramya Radhika DD.\n \n Gurudev, I can\u0027t imagine what my life would have been without the association of devotees. By the mercy of Sri Sri Radhagopinath ji, I came into association with devotees in the year 2007 when I was in the final year of my graduation and attended a program hosted by a team of devotees in Borivali where over 500 college students came. I was immediately followed up by devotees in Borivali who invited me to Mahavan bace where there were beautiful deities of Jagannath, Baldev, and Subhadra, along with Gaur Nitai. I was quickly drawn to bace programs and weekly satsang programs being conducted specifically for boys, where eminent speakers would come, like His Grace Vraja Bijari prabhu, Mukund Chaitanya Prabhu, Gauranga prabhu, and many others.\n \n I was helped and nicely taken care of by a lot of devotees staying in and as well as outside of bace, like Manish Ahuja, Manish Goel, Madhusudan prabhu, Deepak Prabhu, Kalpit Prabhu, Raj Purohit prabhu, Mayur Vani pr, Krsnamurthy prabhu, Rajat Sharma prabhu, and many others. Most of them are now brahmacharis serving in various capacities at satellite centers of ISKCON Chowpatty, and others are grihasthas.\n \n I received a lot of love, care, and attention from all the devotees that I got attracted to Mridanga, Kartal playing, and also deity dressing, along with SMS sending services, maintenance of the database of devotees coming for boys\u0027 programs, and sending out weekly invites to hundreds and more devotees week after week.\n \n Also, I would design sometimes passes for the Borivali version of Prerna lectures.\n \n I attended many yatras to Tirupati, HAMPI, AHOBILAM, Dwarka, Somnath in the first 5 to 6 years, and seeing everyone together in KC, chanting, eating prasadam, and taking the Lord\u0027s darshan kept my faith steadfast in KC.\n \n Later, under the guidance of HG Vraja Bihari prabhu, we also started the Arise India Forum website to publish articles written by him to create awareness about Indian Vedic culture, Hinduism, and related articles that one can\u0027t imagine. 15 years ago, this website one fine day received 4 lakh visitors on a single day in the year 2011 and crashed as we didn\u0027t have enough planning to cater to such a high volume of visitors on the website.\n \n Gradually in 2012, congregation programs started at the same Gopal\u0027s Garden venue where we started off with the JOSD program, and many people started to connect and started becoming devotees.\n \n My faith in KC became stronger and stronger, and in the year 2014, I went to Sridham Mayapur for the first time, where I saw devotees chanting and dancing from across the world. That was like a real united nations that further attracted me to KC.\n \n Between 2013 and 2014, my connection was established with you, O Gurudev, when myself and my wife had some difficulty convincing our parents and then finalizing the date for our wedding to marry a KC partner. We would together pray every day, first thing after waking up from our respective homes, to you and SSRG ji for help and guidance, and everything happened smoothly after that.\n \n As we heard many stories at that time from HG Anand Vrindavan prabhu about how you helped him and went and sat at his home personally to take care of your disciple.\n \n Our faith in your words, O Gurudev, grew stronger day by day, listening to your lectures on Chaitanya Charitamrita and Srimad Bhagavatam that always attracted us to KC.\n \n It was somewhere in November/December, exactly 10 years ago, we heard your voice for the very first time without a mic when we had an opportunity to share with you our wedding invite. You accepted it so happily and blessed us both, me and my wife Ramya Radhika Riya at that time.\n \n By the mercy of HG Gauranga Prabhu, I also had an opportunity to work on a marketing campaign for one of your talks at Bombay Stock Exchange on water conservation that was attended by over 300 to 400 people. All of these people had signed up through online advertisement done by me, and the management team of Earth Forum was really happy with the outcome. This was the time when Gauranga prabhu introduced me to you, and once again, I had the opportunity to see you and meet you face to face.\n \n Gurudev, during the time of your book release, \"Journey Home,\" when many devotees would take your autograph on the book, and I didn\u0027t have a copy of your book, you still very graciously wrote your initial R and circled it with a pen on my diary.\n \n Gurudev, later, my wife and I were nicely taken care of by HG Sridama Prabhu and Kishori Mataji as we moved to grihastha ashram, and they shared many of your pastimes with them, which further attracted us to you and your divine mercy. And then we have been nicely taken care of by HG Rasaparayan prabhu and Gopi Manjari Mataji.\n \n Through the annual drama, you gave many opportunities to take your darshan and your personal association year after year, when after the end of the drama, you would come and meet all the actors and artists. Thank you for entrusting me with the service of drama sound that would please you and devotees.\n \n Thank you, Gurudev, for creating so many opportunities for us to serve through Radhagopinath mandir and its community of devotees through book distribution, bace programs, congregation programs, annual yatras and dramas, and the wonderful Govardhan Eco Village that you gave us all.\n \n On this most auspicious day of your Vyas Puja, I find myself reflecting on the immeasurable impact you’ve had on my life. While I may not have the opportunity to always immerse myself in spiritual activities as much as I desire, your teachings and example provide me with an anchor in the storm of my daily responsibilities towards office and family.\n \n Maharaj, your words and actions remind me that even in the midst of life’s chaos, there is always a chance to connect with Krishna and serve with sincerity.\n \n Your unwavering dedication to Srila Prabhupada’s mission and your compassion for every soul inspire me to do better in whatever time I can dedicate.\n \n It is your example of humility, love, and selfless service that motivates me to strive for balance in my life and to ensure that Krishna remains at the center, even when the material world pulls me in every direction.\n \n Your ability to transform lives with your wisdom and genuine care is a testament to the depth of your spiritual realization, and I feel blessed to have received even a fraction of your guidance through you and the community of devotees of SSRGM.\n \n On this occasion, I humbly pray for your blessings so that I may continue to grow in devotion and learn to better serve Guru, Krishna, and their devotees, that I always remember Krishna and never forget Krishna.\n \n Gurudev, it is you and Krishna who do everything in the background, but others and I feel that I am doing it. \"Karte ho tum Kanhaiya, mera naam ho raha hai.\"\n \n You always took care through all the ups and downs of our life. I had 10+ job changes in 15+ years of work experience, but I was never without a job, because of which our financials were always secure.\n \n Your lectures always give us that hope and always give answers to whatever problems that life throws at us.\n \n Gurudev, I want to pray at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radhagopinath ji on this auspicious day of your Vyas Puja that He always keeps you healthy and gives you immense strength to touch the hearts of millions of people across the world, which you are already doing.\n \n Thank you, thank you, Gurudev, for giving us Radhagopinath ji, Srila Prabhupada, and the best of both worlds—senior devotees in our life like Vraja Bihari Prabhu, Anand Vrindavan prabhu, Gauranga prabhu, Govind Prabhu, Radhagopinath prabhu, and grihastha counselors like Sridama Prabhu, Kishori Mataji, Rasaparayan prabhu, Gopi Manjari Mataji, and several others, that we remain on track in KC.\n \n At home, thank you for giving us deities of Nimai Nitai and Prahlad Narsimhadev and a wonderful devoted wife Ramya Radhika and a lovely child Divyam, and friends like Govind Prem and Radhika Prem and several other friends.\n \n Thank you, dear Gurudev. We love you lots from the bottom of our heart.\n }}\n Aspiring to be your servant,\n Madhav Prem, Ramya Radhika, and Divyam.\n \n His Holiness Radhanath Maharaj ki jai! Srila Prabhupada ki jai! Jai!"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Srila Gurumaharaj,\n Please accept my most humble \u0026 respectful obeisances unto Your Divine Lotus Feet.\n I am sincerely grateful and deeply wish to thank Lord Sri Krishna for providing me such a great, invaluable moment in this human form of life where I can utilize this very moment to deeply contemplate and consciously endeavor to understand where I have been currently picked up and situated in my life by the causeless mercy of You.\n As I reflect back upon my animalistic and hard-labor-like struggling life, three years back from now, I remember the very first thing told to me by a Hare Krishna devotee was about \"A person with a deep and serious spiritual quest in His life, traveling across the globe hitchhiking to the holy land of India...\". This, like many other incidents of my life, are not actually at all incidents but divine arrangements of Shri Krishna in my life.\n I’ve been a so-called human being, living with all kinds of animalistic propensities and habits not much conducive for Bhakti, and do not deserve to remain in the association of Vaishnavas. My attachment and emotions to my own perceptions of life have always been dragging me to the miseries of life. But by your Divine Grace and instructions, I find a strong purpose and shelter to live for something in life. It\u0027s all the power of your divine words, O Gurudeva, by which this two-legged animal is turning into a human. And sheltered by your words, empowered disciples like HG Radheshyam Prabhuji, HG Achyuta Mohan Prabhuji, HG Satya Sankarshan Prabhuji, and Himanshu Prabhuji have been always instrumental for my faith in Krishna, the process of Krishna Consciousness, \u0026 Srila Prabhupada. They are continuously opening my eyes filled with illusions of this material world and giving me *shastra cakshu* to comprehend the purpose of this very human form of life. You provided me with the most important of all knowledge, which is to realize my true identity as a spirit soul and re-establish in my natural *svabhava* of loving and serving The Divine Lordships of Sri Sri Radha Krishna.\n I have no qualification to glorify Your unlimited glories and pastimes by my ignorant mind, but taking it as an opportunity for my own purification, I’d love to list a few of them and always keep them at the very core of my heart. I am deeply touched by Your faith and love for Srila Prabhupada, and how sincerely You have taken His teachings and lived Your whole life as an offering to Him. You had just three to four personal interactions with Srila Prabhupada, that too with actions and not words, but have taken the essence of His teachings through Your regular, constant association with Him through His words and serving through His instructions. I remember during very difficult times of the development of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Mandir, You always kept everyone united and sheltered under one tree of Srila Prabhupada’s ISKCON. Your initial life in New Vrindavana and Youth Preaching service there teaches us the meaning of true love, renunciation, and determination all together simultaneously, which is exemplary. As You showed us the real meaning of Bhakti, that is to only give love and love and love to one and all, without expecting anything for oneself but only for the pleasure of one\u0027s Spiritual Master.\n Srila Gurumaharaj, You are filled with the topmost realizations of life \u0026 Krishna Prema through Your love \u0026 surrender for Srila Prabhupada that You always only desire to give Krishna to each and every *jiva* living on this planet. If it so pleases You, please bless me with such simple faith, purity, humility, tolerance, sincerity, seriousness, shelter in Guru Parampara, and Your words, like You do have always in Srila Prabhupada. I seek for strength from You that may I be able to serve nicely locally and to my parent temple and everywhere throughout the world for propagating The movement of Shri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the right spirit of being a humble instrument of compassion in the hands of my superiors. May I be always able to follow Your Divine instructions in my life and live my life in the spirit of being a servant of servant of servant of devotees and make my goal of life just to serve, satisfy, and please Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas. I desire to serve You more and more through serving Your instructions You’ve given in Your classes and Your faithful disciples, my *shiksha gurus* like HG Radheshyam Prabhuji and HG Achyuta Mohan Prabhuji. I pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Ji and Gaura Nitai that may They give You good health.\n Thank you very much,\n Your Insignificant Servant of Servant,\n Madhav Tiwari"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisance.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n \n Maharaj, I was almost in my eighth month of pregnancy when I came to know that my name was on the list for Brahmin Initiation, this was in April 2023. I was totally surprised and felt a bit nervous at the same time. I never expected this, especially during my pregnancy. After I got to know this, I sat silently in one place, thinking about this mercy flowing my way. I suddenly realized strongly from within that maybe it\u0027s not me; it is the soul within who is the actual recipient of this special mercy. My heart again and again kept saying the same thing: \"Or else, why would this moment come during my pregnancy?\" I also had a strong desire to visit GEV throughout my pregnancy, but my husband said the roads were bumpy, making it difficult to go. But when this Initiation news came, my desire to visit Vrindavan and Govardhan got fulfilled.\n \n Maharaj, when I entered your room for the Initiation, you smiled, looking at me with so much motherly affection and concern. You also asked me about my well-being and if I would like to sit on a chair. Those words filled with love and concern moved me completely. After the Initiation, my heart and the baby within were dancing with happiness, and my eyes were filled with tears of joy and contentment from meeting you personally, which I never expected. Thank you, Gurudev. Later, you named my baby girl Yamuna, and we all desperately wanted this name for her. During the day of her Annaprashan ceremony at Radhagopinath temple, we got to know that you were at GEV, so we were waiting for Baldev prabhu to feed her mahaprasad kheer. Suddenly, Baldev prabhu informed us that Maharaj was reaching the temple in five minutes, so we should be ready. We immediately arranged for the kheer, and you personally fed it to little Yamuna with so much love. We were all surprised by this reciprocation from you with little Yamuna. Also, during the Kartik yatra at Govardhan, she was just 1.5 years old, and while I was standing outside the pandal at the end, I asked her where Guru Maharaj was, and she perfectly recognized him by pointing at the stage. Maharaj, since she was five months old, she started recognizing you from your photograph, and this also surprised us a lot. Thank you, Maharaj, for the showers of mercy upon little Yamuna and upon all of us.\n \n Maharaj, the compassion that you have for all living beings is what touches me the most. No matter whether the person is a known or unknown friend, or someone you are meeting for the first time, you always deal with everyone with compassion and kindness, which is so exemplary. On this auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, I beg you to give me shelter at your lotus feet always, irrespective of all the shortcomings that I am struggling with. Also, please bless me so that I can chant the holy names with love and attention, and can give up all the anarthas within and can remain grateful for all that I have. I sincerely beg forgiveness for all my anarthas and sins which I have committed and feel eternally indebted to you for accepting me as your disciple. Thank you so much, Gurudev.\n \n Your servant,\n Madhavi Gopika Devi Dasi"

It is such an amazing experience. I just feel like I should not be in a hurry. I am trying to do the service in a mood of servant of the servant.\nThis year, one big thing happened with me: I got an opportunity to do the 12 am *arati* on the night of Janmashtami. I don’t feel myself eligible for this, but because of the mercy of senior devotees Ananda Gopika Mataji my shiksha guru and our temple president Tukaram Prabhuji, I got this opportunity.

Your glorious life is a perfect harmony of Sadhana, Seva, Sadachar, Sadhu-sanga, and Svadhyaya — each one shining with the purity of your devotion to Srila Prabhupada and to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. Each of these aspects of your life is exemplary and strengthens and nourishes us immensely on our path of Bhakti.\n \n Gurudev, Your sadhana stands as a constant source of inspiration for us. You show us that real happiness and Prema Bhakti comes from the inner connection to the Holy Name. You have always instructed and emphasized sincere, serious, uncompromised, and consistent Sadhana, and you live these instructions with your own example. Chanting beads are your Deities; this epitomizes your immense love and devotion for your Sadhana.\n \n Your seva is love in action — tireless and unmatchable. Your service flows without pause, touching and transforming hearts everywhere. Whether speaking to thousands or caring for one devotee in silence, you serve with such humility, love, and compassion. You teach us that love is in the details and to love is to serve, thus inspiring us to put all our heart and efforts in pleasing the Lord and devotees with selfless service.\n \n Gurudev, You show and teach us through your example that sadhu-sanga is not just being in the company of devotees, but cultivating relationships centered on service, humility, and the desire to help each other remember Krishna. You show us that spiritual progress is never an isolated effort; it grows in the warmth of genuine devotee association.\n \n Gurudev, Your sadachar, pure character, and impeccable conduct, silently preach louder than words. You embody Srila Prabhupada’s instruction that “purity is the force.” Your every gesture, every word, every interaction radiates kindness and compassion. Through your affectionate and respectful dealings with your Godfamily, senior members of the society, and the devotees, you effortlessly win everyone’s hearts and inspire us to follow in your footsteps.\n \n Your Svadhyaya, O Gurudev, your deep study and contemplation of the scriptures, flows like a stream of nectar nourishing all who hear from you. Every word you speak carries the essence of shastra and realization, turning philosophy into living wisdom that uplifts our hearts and keeps us grounded in our KC.\n \n Gurudev, through your life, these five aspects come together like five petals of a lotus flower, each revealing the fragrance of pure love and devotion.\n \n You concluded this year’s Kartik yatra with the instructions that, to reciprocate to the compassion of Srila Prabhupada and the entire parampara, we should become more determined in Sadhana, to be more determined to not engage in Prajalpa but to hear and chant the glories of the Lord, and find better ways to serve the Lord, to be the servant of the servant of the servant of devotees for the pleasure of the Lord. With this meditation and goal in my heart, I beg and pray for your mercy to give me the strength to honor these instructions and follow in your footsteps in serving Srila Prabhupada’s mission.\n \n Please continue to keep us in your loving shelter, be our constant well-wisher and guide, as you have always been.\n \n Praying at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath for your continued good health and well-being.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Madhavi Sundari DD"

They are always inviting the devotees for home programs. On festival days, most of the congregation gets involved in some way or other in performing devotional service.\nWe can\u0027t really express the great joy we experience trying to follow your footsteps.\nBy seeing your tireless efforts in developing the wonderful congregations like Chowpatty under your care, the projects like the Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Govardhan Eco-Village, and many others, I get amazed in seeing your dedication, care, and guidance you spend on every member, making them feel included in their respective yatras.\nIn order to start my days, the first thing I do after paying obeisances to you, SP, and to our home Deities, is to hear a brief class from SP, from you, or your amazing godbrothers while I prepare the paraphernalia for such home worship.\nIt\u0027s just so nectarean to hear from great and advanced devotees like yourself about Krishna katha, that once you take SP’s books and read them, all that has been heard from you resonates clearly, making the contents of it total sense.\nNow, after a break we had in performing temple devotional service, by the kind mercy of our wonderful temple president and the congregation of devotees here in Edmonton, we are making an attempt to please you, SP, and Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha-Govinda.\nIt’s very encouraging to see my dear wife eagerly serving in the pujari department, and my kids immersed in the different activities at the temple, dedicating their different talents to the service of the Lord. Please keep showering us with your kind mercy so we can keep up with the requirements to qualify as an\naspiring servant at your lotus feet.\nLord Krishna says in BG 18-66: sarva-dharmam parityajya, mam ekan saranam vraja, aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah.\nThe last sentence, ma sucah, \"do not fear, don\u0027t worry,\" really resonates in the heart of the devotees. Lord Krishna is giving assurance so we can gain confidence that all we need to do is to surrender to Him through the parampara system, very well established and carefully guarded by our acharyas.\nWe pray to the Lord to bless you with health and long life, so we can get your mercy and purify our existence as far as possible to properly serve you and SP.\nYour insignificant servant: Madhukantha das."

I am often careless, distracted, and weak in my spiritual practice. Still, your instructions give me strength. By your mercy alone, I am trying to chant 16 rounds sincerely every day. Please bless me that I may chant attentively, without offenses, and with a sincere desire to serve Kṛṣṇa.\n \n This year, my only prayer is to become a more steady and faithful servant of your mission.

Each moment I have the blessing to witness your engagement with others I am taken aback. Your ability to love and accept all beings is just as Radha and Krishna have hoped for us all. The ways in which you can hold space for each person who approaches you, changes people’s lives. The love of the Divine flows through you as a conduit of eternal embrace. The gentleness that you provide is the touch that souls need in this darkened world of chaos to soften and land in the safety and security of our Beloved Lord.\n \n Your essence is that in which trust is built, through love and acceptance. The foundation for a deeper surrender is continually provided through your glance, love, teaching, and living example. Ultimately, you have built a space within my heart that allows for me to move closer to the truth of who I am, as an eternal being, outside of the confines created in this lifetime. And it is through your shelter that I understand that there is always opportunity to listen and grow in such a way I can continually evolve on this path.\n \n When I reflect on this beautiful offering you provide for us all, I am reminded of the story you shared in a lecture at GEV the day after I aspired to take shelter with you. The story of the pigeon and the king. When you looked my way and shared just how much one would give for each and every one of God’s children that have been entrusted in one’s care. I could feel the sense of how much you deeply and eternally care for each soul that is placed on this earth. Everyday, you inspire me to live more deeply as an instrument of Krishna’s love, to serve in such a way that is for the wellbeing of others and to please Him.\n \n As I meet you, at your lotus feet, in my japa each day, that feeling of acceptance, love, and shelter is sweeter than any Vermont-made maple syrup could ever be; it is the divine mercy of Guru. I strive each day to try my very best to follow in the shadow of your footsteps, to love all, to serve all, and to live a life in service to Radha and Krishna just as you offer for us all.\n \n Your presence and your embodiment of Bhakti is something we all need in this world. While it is something that can never truly be fully articulated, in this moment of your Vyasa Puja, it is my prayer that you are able to receive in the Divine love that flows through us as a result of all you have shared with us, as a beautiful reflection of all that you are. The sweetness of Krishna personified in loving exchange, given for you.\n \n With all that I am, and my head on the ground before you, Hare Krishna.\n \n In love and gratitude, your eternal servant,\n \n Madhuri Gopi Devi Dasi Vermont, USA"

Words would fall short to describe your merciful glories. However I want to make a small effort to express my feelings of gratitude towards you.\n\nMaharaja your life is simply an expression of love, devotion and gratitude for your glorious spiritual master Srila Prabhupada, and you continuously strive to serve him through various ways...one of the projects which again is an offering to Srila Prabhupada is our Govardhan Eco village...and through your love we can see how Sri Vrindavan and Sri Giriraj ji have manifested there... everything there is so divine...be it Sri Radha Madan Mohan ji temple, seven temples...yamuna ji, prem sarovar, goshala everything directly brings us to Vrindavan... however one of the most unique thing that we see there is the Vaishnava memorial Altar at the foothills of Giriraj ji...this place has alway moved my stone like heart deeply... never have we seen anything like this anywhere...this is personally the place which gives me a lot of shelter...and makes my gratitude for you grow even deeper... because this beautiful Vaishnava memorial sthali shows how you care for each and every devotee i am saying this from the perspective of seeing the second generation departed of Vaishnavas even after they depart from this world, how you value their contribution and mostly how you are providing them eternal shelter of Sri Giriraj ji by offering them to Him.\n\nDuring our recently concluded Kartik Yatra, I was only thinking of this fact that how you tirelessly work hard to bring us to give the shelter of Giriraj ji,  giving us residence there for seven days and seven nights giving us memorable experiences through your lectures, kirtans, morning dham darshans, prasadam etc...your only intention is that we develop love for Sri Giridhari...and that\u0027s what you have been doing for so many years to give us Krishna and help us develop some love and devotion for Krishna...while we are still living you want to give the shelter of Giriraj ji and even after a devotee departs you place them at the foothills of Giriraj ji...this is truly devotee care in fullest extent...like one of GEV resident devotee said this is devotee care even after death... Maharaja where can we find such compassion? This is something beyond our comprehension....without any qualification i also have been the recipient of your unlimited mercy. Because of you we also got to reside at the foothills of Giriraj ji....I am very dull headed i don\u0027t know what is best for me...but today and for eternity I pray that may I always strive to be in harmony with what you expect from us. Let me always live up to your expectations and let me gratefully receive what you are mercifully giving us.\n\n On this auspicious day we pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath ji to bless you with many more healthy years...so that many, many more countless suffering souls receive your shelter.\n\nThank you for everything that you continue to do for all of us. We all love you and want to serve you in a pleasing way... seeking your blessings upon our daughter Jahnava so that she can serve you and all the Vaishnavas to the best of her ability.\n\nWith Unlimited gratitude,\nYour unworthy daughter, Madri dasi."

I am very grateful to the wonderful **counseling** system and **for** growing such a community where we are feeling **sheltered**.\n\nFirst time I have visited GEV this year and I can see how much you cherish Vrindavan. I ask some attachment to Vrindavan from you like the way you have it. By your mercy we got a chance to stay under Govardan hill; it was really like a dream of being in Goloka and experiencing Govardhan lila during the yatra this year.\n\nSome of the points that touched my heart from your class in yatra this year are:\n\n1. All the animals danced, giving up their past conditioning and cooperated. Not only that, but they went to the extreme of a tiger kissing a deer. Similarly, in **sankirtan**, we all should cooperate with each other. What are those **petty** small conditions in front of the power of **sankirtan**?\n\n2. One pure chanting of Hare Krishna mantra is enough and is the same as the 9 processes of **devotional** service.\n\n3. Indra thought the people of Vrindavan were very proud, but the world is a reflection of our own mind, and Indra was proud himself. We should not find fault in others.\n\n4. Sanatan Goswami took service from Srimati Radharani, and devotees may have emotional, physical needs. We should not tell them to be transcendental like the Goswamis, but we love Krishna. Krishna loves everyone, everyone is Krishna\u0027s children, so we should love everyone.\n\n5. Krishna is more pleased when we serve devotees than directly serving Him.\n\n6. Be kind to everyone and, in a small or big way, share this love of Krishna consciousness to others. Take **shelter** of the holy name.\n\nI personally felt, Maharaj, like a father sending his children on a difficult work for a long time with so much love and care. I felt you sent us back from the yatra with those loving words. It was very difficult to be separated from that experience. I felt very safe being with you.\n\nI hope I continue to follow your instruction to take **shelter** of the holy name and be kind and share this with others in whatever way I can. By doing this, I feel I am always with you.\n\nThank you very, very much for everything, my Dear Guru Maharaj."

It was like Mother Ganga flowing from one city to another, touching millions of lives across the country.\n Little did I know my turn would also come when you got next to me. Immediately, you held both my hands with both of your hands.\n The next thing I experienced was you looking right into my eyes and saying, \"There is a lot going on in your life. You come and meet me. I want to know everything.\"\n I was speechless, couldn\u0027t speak a word. Yes, there was a lot going on in my mind, and your midas touch, personalism, and your unconditional love within seconds took away everything I was experiencing due to uncertainty on the financial front, due to health issues caused by the stress of my cousin sister who was going through turmoil, and multiple other issues.\n After I got back home, I was reflecting on another experience I had with you in New Vrndavan, where there was one devotee who was experiencing a severe problem with his tooth, due to which he had swelling in his mouth. Since he didn\u0027t have money and insurance, he was struggling. At that time, you went to an extent of saying to another devotee, \"Call my father and seek his support to get his problem fixed.\"\n Guru Maharaj, in the world where impersonalism is on the rise due to social media and technology, your personalism is like getting access to water in the desert; it\u0027s like getting access to light in darkness.\n On your auspicious 75th appearance day, while praying for your good health, I would like to pray to get or imbibe one quality of personalism, that too not superficially but from the heart, so I may be able to pay it forward to others in need and impact lives.

I thought that Guru Maharaja was talking and giving instructions to everyone through his lectures. I was listening to each and every one of your beautiful lectures very, very attentively, forgetting all other things. I just kept looking at you. I was also praying for you in my mind.

Guru Maharaja, you were passing very close. I was standing on one side. You looked toward me and you stopped. You smiled at me, and with wide eyes, slowly said \"Haribol\". My joy was unbounded. What great power in those two words! You understood my heart. You blessed me. You took away all my faults. My sins were destroyed. You bathed me and made me holy with the nectar of your words. Your eyes were filled with grace, compassion, and blessings. When you left, I bowed down. I also prayed for the devotees of Latur. I was very happy because my Guru Maharaja looked at me with love.

Please forgive me; due to my foolishness, I missed 1 and 1/2 days of the yatra.\n Maharaj, I beg you to please keep me in your shelter always. I am simply helpless without your mercy and HDG SP\u0027s mercy. I am insignificant. I want to give my life in serving SP\u0027s mission by serving your mission in the association of devotees. Please accept me. I don\u0027t know how it will be possible, but only by your mercy can it be possible. I don\u0027t want to lose this human form of life. I want to practice devotional life very seriously, sincerely, and without any ulterior motive. Only by your grace can it be possible.\n Looking for shelter at your lotus feet,\n Ys"

Each year, this day reminds me of the immeasurable fortune of being connected to our glorious paramparā through your divine shelter.\n\nThis year, by your causeless mercy, I was blessed to participate in the Kartik Yatra. It felt like a priceless gift, as I was able to hear your nectarean Krishna-katha. Your words transported my consciousness to the sacred pastimes of the Lord, bringing life to my desert-dry heart—just as the monsoon rain nourishes barren land for fresh cultivation. Your katha cultivates devotion within me, awakening the dormant seed of Bhakti.\n\nBy another wonderful arrangement, I was given the fortune to serve HG Bhurijana Prabhu as a personal servant. While serving him, I always remembered that service to senior Vaishnavas is service to you. I considered every moment of that service as an offering at your lotus feet. Though my heart longs to approach you personally for blessings, I hesitate, not wanting to disturb you in any way. Still, I pray that someday I may be worthy of receiving your glance and affectionate instructions.\n\nKrishna has been extremely kind by allowing me to serve Vaishnavas in whatever small capacity I possess. I pray to remain always a humble servant of the servant of your servants. Please hold me by my śikhā and guide me safely to the eternal home of Vrindavan.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I feel truly wealthy, for I have received a treasury of Bhakti-jewels in the form of your divine qualities and instructions. My only duty is to take even one precious instruction at a time and follow it with sincerity. By doing so, I know my life will attain perfection.\n\nThank you for everything you have given me—far more than I deserve.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nMana Mohana Dās"

Yet, this occasion gives me a chance to express whatever love I may have for you. Though, I am not even sure whether I truly have love for you, or if I am merely pretending to love you just to show others.\n\nI have known you since the time when I did not even know about ISKCON. Perhaps it is only by your causeless mercy that I became connected to ISKCON and the Guru Parampara. I come from a family of caste Brahmins where ritualistic activities are considered the essence of devotion, but by the mercy of you and devotees, I have come to understand the true meaning of bhakti. I have accepted you as my spiritual master, and I pray to the Lord Radha Shyam-Sundar for the day when you will accept me as your disciple.\n\nDevotion teaches us something from every Vaishnava, but from you, I have learned selfless love for the Lord. You always speak about the welfare of humanity, and the true welfare, as you teach, is to bring every living being closer to Radha \u0026 Krishna. Your compassion for all living entities and your continued efforts for the welfare of society, even while facing ill health, are a great source of inspiration for every disciple.\n\nYou have taught that all living beings, no matter what body they inhabit, are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and to harm them is to cause pain to the Lord Himself. This is the true mark of a pure Vaishnava. You have shown me the right path to live by, and I know that countless lives have been transformed through your guidance. You are very dear to Srila Prabhupada, and by receiving your mercy, we too can become dear to the great Acharyas.\n\nWhenever I see you, I am reminded of the teaching of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu — “तृणादपि सुनीचेन, तरोरिव सहिष्णुना, अमानिना मानदेना, कीर्तनियः सदा हरिः।”. Your example constantly inspires me to live by these words and to cultivate true humility, tolerance, and devotion in my life.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I know that your daily life is filled with countless responsibilities, yet you still take out your precious time to shower mercy upon the devotees. If this is not your causeless mercy, then what else could it be?\n\nI pray to Sri Sri Radha Parth-Sarathi that They bless you with good health and strength so that all of us, your aspiring followers, may continue to receive your association and develop pure love for the Supreme Lord Krishna.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I offer this humble plea at your lotus feet. I was never qualified to perform bhakti, but by being attracted to you and through the association of devotees, I have somehow come to the path of devotion. Please bestow your mercy upon me so that I may also make this human life successful and attain the ultimate goal of life: \"pure devotional love\".\n\nOn this sacred day, I pray to the Guru Parampara and the Pancha Tattva for your good health, and I also pray to Lord Narsimha Deva to remove all obstacles in your life and bless you with strength and protection.\n\nYour servant of the servants.\n\nManish Tiwari\nEast of Kailash\nSant Nagar, New Delhiè"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nOver the last couple of years, I have been listening to your lectures with more regularity and more eagerness than ever before. As part of my service to Sri Sri Radha-Kalachandji, I am now regularly scheduled to give Srimad-Bhagavatam class, and I feel deeply grateful to be able to repeat even a drop of what I have heard from you.\n\nSome of the teachings that have settled deepest in my mind and heart this year include:\n\n• Why Lord Chaitanya chose Ishvara Puri as His guru—because of Ishvara Puri’s unparalleled humility and his willingness to perform the most menial personal service for his own spiritual master. This teaches us that a spiritual master’s true qualification is not their learning or eloquence, but their loving service to their own guru. Your unwavering dedication to Srila Prabhupada—your life of service, sacrifice, and loyalty to his mission—constantly reminds me what real discipleship looks like.\n\n• Gratitude requires humility—that we are only grateful for things we feel we do not deserve.\n\n• Real advancement happens when we serve even when we don’t feel like it. When the mind wants to “do something else,” but we choose Krishna anyway, that is the moment we truly take a step forward on the bhakti path.\n\n• Remember every good anyone has done for you, and forget the rest.\n\n• If we want Krishna’s forgiveness, we must forgive others—be mindful of how many lifetimes of offenses we have committed before being given even the smallest spark of bhakti.\n\n• Grihastha life as a partnership—that Krishna conscious marriage should not be something we merely tolerate due to vows, but something dynamic, alive, and centered on service to Krishna. When husband and wife help each other advance, their home becomes an ashrama, a place of purification.\n\nOne teaching in particular touched me very deeply. In a 1990 Q\u0026A session in Mumbai, you told the story of your days in New Vrindavan—when you were getting only a few hours of sleep, working constantly, and had almost no time for reading. You described how you would rush your prasadam, then force yourself to read while walking quickly and reading aloud just to stay awake. Because you approached the Bhagavatam with such eagerness and sacrifice—tapasya—you learned more during those difficult days than at any other time. You taught that Krishna reciprocates not with our intellect or memory, but with our sacrifice, our earnestness, and our hunger to understand even one line of His message. That one story changed the way I approach my reading, my hearing, and even my attempts to teach.\n\nThank you, Maharaj. Your words continue to guide me, challenge me, and steady me. I pray to develop a fraction of your hunger to serve Srila Prabhupada and the Vaishnavas in this lifetime. I know that I am a fool, an imposter, and have no qualification to speak on the scriptures, but whatever little I am able to share in classes is only because of what I have received from you. Please bless me to always listen with eagerness, to practice with sincerity, and to serve Sri Sri Radha-Kalachandji and the devotees in the spirit of the teachings you have given.\n\nYour servant,\nManjari Gopika"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n Please accept my humble obeisances, dear Guru Maharaj.\n On this, my dearest day, your appearance day, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your mercy, your example of pure devotion to Srila Prabhupada, and your commitment to his mission.\n Almost a year has passed since the initiation you bestowed upon me on Srila Prabhupada\u0027s behalf.\n Throughout this time, I have tried to follow your instructions and your example.\n This year has been a very difficult test for our family.\n My husband nearly lost his life. He spent three and a half months in the hospital, and only thanks to your prayers and the prayers of devotees was he able to overcome his illness and is now in rehabilitation.\n Just before Anantatma Prabhu was released from the hospital, our son Nimai Krishnachandra was drafted into the army. And only thanks to the prayers of devotees is he alive and continuing his spiritual practice in military conditions.\n Dear Guru Maharaj, once, in Chowpatty Temple, in answer to my question: Can a person with my past hope for salvation? You said, \"Serve the devotees, serve the exalted devotees, that will save you.\"\n Since then, I have tried to follow your words, and by the grace of HH Keshava Swami, Anantatma Prabhu and I perform any service that Maharaj tells us.\n For three years, we\u0027ve been organizing trips around India for him and his disciples, including pilgrimages to Vrindavan, Puri, and Mayapur. In November, he\u0027ll be bringing groups to Govardhan Ecovillage.\n Maharaj provides much service through caring for devotees, and every time, in different situations, I remember your example, Guru Maharaj—how you care for devotees and how you teach us to treat them.\n It can be very difficult in situations of injustice to remember Krishna and the soul, and at such moments, a phrase you said in one of your lectures comes to mind: \"If you\u0027re right, you\u0027re still wrong.\"\n This helps to soften the situation and maintain relationships.\n I won\u0027t take up much of your time, dear Gurudev.\n I\u0027ll conclude my letter with words of immeasurable gratitude for all the lessons you\u0027ve taught me.\n Especially the lesson of your faith in us disciples, when on May 4, 2024, we sat in the Moscow temple with new kanthimalas around our necks, awaiting initiation, and you informed us of Gopal Krishna Goswami\u0027s grave condition and the cancellation of the initiation.\n At that moment, a cry of \"Jai, Gurudev!\" burst from my heart.\n I felt that, despite being one twenty-thousandth part of a family of disciples, you spiritually love and believe in me—in my strength and steadfastness, in my ability to understand you without words.\n And at that moment, I also understood the true meaning of your words, \"We are Prabhupada\u0027s family.\"\n I felt that it was at that moment that you united me with this family.\n By denying me the ritual of initiation, you initiated us into the original essence of the science and practice of bhakti.\n You taught me a second, very important lesson without words when, after a week at Ecovillage, I left for Puri to continue my service to Keshava Swami and my husband, Anantatma Prabhu.\n When you heard about my plans, you made a gesture with your hand as if you were touching the ground and smiled approvingly.\n At that moment, I realized what was truly dear to your heart was not my presence, but my unceasing service to the Vaishnavas—those dear to the Lord and Srila Prabhupada.\n Thank you so much, dear Guru Maharaj, for your mercy and generosity toward me.\n I think of you in every event, every day, no matter what happens.\n I remember your words and your example first and foremost.\n In this way, I learn to live as you once told me: \"No matter how far we may be, we must learn to live as if I were always near.\"\n This year, the Tomsk Yatra organized a wonderful Ratha Yatra festival, and evenings dedicated to Srila Prabhupada continue to be held.\n Every day, the temple prepares a beautiful bhoga offering to Sri Sri Nitai Gaura Chandra, and every evening of the week, interesting programs are organized for the parishioners.\n Bowing at your feet, I tearfully pray:\n Please bless me with pure love for Radha and Krishna,\n An unbreakable connection with the mission of Srila Prabhupada,\n And a strong taste for serving the Vaishnavas...\n Your obedient servant,\n Ananta Devi Dasi"

I will take the instructions of all my śikṣā-gurus as my life and soul and try to serve and please them.\n \n Your Dāsānudāsānudāsa,\n Megha Shukla"

Your compassion and mercy are beyond the capacity of my words to describe.\nFor a long time, I thought that you began taking care of me only from the day I formally took shelter of you. But now I realize how mistaken I was. You have been guiding my path, watching over me, and preparing my heart for your shelter long before I even knew of your divine presence.\nHow truly fortunate I am to have come under your merciful guidance.

You narrate each pastime with such depth, detail, and devotion that it reflects your deep love for Mahaprabhu. Even with my limited understanding, I have noticed that you always connect every Hari-katha—even Krishna-lila—to the teachings and mood of Lord Chaitanya.\nOn this sacred day of your divine appearance, I sincerely beg for shelter at your lotus feet. I know I am still far from becoming your worthy disciple. I need to strengthen my sadhana and strive to imbibe genuine Vaishnava qualities within my heart. At present, my heart feels hard like a rock—lacking compassion and filled with selfish desires. Without your causeless mercy, I have no hope of transformation.\nTherefore, Gurudev, I beg you to kindly continue to shower your mercy upon me, as you have always done, so that I may gradually purify myself and one day become a true servant of your mission.\n\nYour aspiring servant of the servant of the servant of the servant,\nMounika Seeram"

Your ability to simplify complex spiritual concepts and make them accessible to all is a testament to your exceptional wisdom and dedication. Maharajji, Your teaching literally helped me at every step of my life. Whenever I feel lonely, stressed out, I watch your lectures on YouTube; it makes me happy and peaceful instantly. And one thing happens with me every time: wherever I get some question in my mind, like, \"What is it? Why did it happen?\" I instantly get your video recommendations on YouTube and I get my answers. I have also read your book in audiobook form, \"The Journey Home,\" from you, Maharajji, on the Iskcon Desire Tree website. My mind was completely shaken; it has become my inspiration even after so many challenges and so many obstacles you had faced, you never gave up. It\u0027s really a motivation for me. Now it\u0027s my second time listening to that audiobook. And also, there is the playlist of all your lectures on Iskcon Desire Tree. I have completed 40% of the lectures and will complete listening to all the lectures very soon.\n \n I like the concept of the good dog and bad dog that you wrote in that book. But Maharajji, my bad dog always dominates me, but I am trying hard for the dominance of the good dog. Also, you have said in that book that always serve everyone, always feed everyone, always love everyone. I am trying my level best, Maharajji, to implement it. And also in many of your lectures, you focused more on congregational chanting, and being always united with devotees, and always be in the mood of *trnad api sunichina*; that also I am trying to implement, but it\u0027s very difficult. As you said about congregational chanting, I had started chanting on Zoom Japa with HG. Anand Vrindavan Prabhuji, and by your mercy, Maharajji, due to that Zoom Japa, for the first time in my life, I have chanted 128 rounds on Nirjala Ekadashi. It\u0027s only happened, Maharajji, because of your mercy and guidance and blessings. As at that time, whenever my determination got low, I watched your lectures on YouTube, which gave me strength. Like that, there are so many new things I have learned from you, Maharajji. For that, so many, many, many, many thanks to you, Maharajji. I am very grateful for the opportunity to learn from you.\n \n Your teachings have not only enriched my spiritual journey but have also positively impacted my personal life. Your emphasis on love, compassion, and selflessness has inspired me to become a better version of myself. I am grateful for your patience, understanding, and guidance, which have helped me navigate life\u0027s challenges with greater ease and confidence.\n \n You are incredibly inspiring, and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to connect with someone as remarkable as you, Maharajji. Your kindness, efforts, and encouragement truly meant a lot to me and made a meaningful difference.\n \n I bow to your lotus feet, dear Maharajji, and pray for your continued blessings and guidance on my spiritual path. I love you, Maharajji, so much. Your impact on my life has been immeasurable, and I am forever indebted to your kindness and wisdom. And I daily pray to Shri Shri Radha Gopinathji for one wish: that I want to meet you, and I have a guarantee that Gopinathji will fulfill it, as Gopinathji fulfills all my wishes. I am so excited and curious and very desperate to meet you, Maharajji, and I know Gopinathji will soon do that. We will meet soon, Maharajji.\n Thank you once again, Maharajji, for everything.\n And one wish: It would be my heartfelt honor to serve you. If you feel there\u0027s a space where I can contribute, I humbly ask for a chance to do so with sincerity, love, and full dedication.\n \n Thank you once again.\n \n Hare Krishna 🙏\n \n Your insignificant servant\n Mrunmayee"

And for so many days, we have been able to listen to your glorification from various devotees, as they have been sharing online from 75 days before your 75th birth anniversary. From all the devotees\u0027 sweet words and my personal experience, I can see you are the personification of all these qualities. Taking this golden opportunity, I would like to share a few drops of your qualities.\n\n🙏Taking care of devotees - Through the counseling system which you have established in ISKCON all over the world, you provide very loving and affectionate care to all the devotees for their personal and all-around growth in ISKCON, especially to all your disciples. We could get your association through our counselor. So we do not feel a lack of your love. Thank you, Gurumaharaj, for giving us so many Shiksha gurus like HG Radheshyam Prabhu, HG Gaurang Prabhu, HG Radha Gopinath Prabhu, HG Shamanand Prabhu, HG Govind Prabhu, HG Braj Bihari Prabhu, HG Gaur Gopal Prabhu, HG Gaurang Darshan Prabhu, and so many Grihastha devotees like our counselor HG Mukund Anand Prabhu, who are all part of your counselor system and guiding us in all ways to remain happy in KC. As we are sheltered under their guidance, we always feel your blessings and mercy upon us.\n\nFor so many years, you have been caring for all of your Godbrothers. Even during and after this 2025 Kartik yatra, you met all your Godbrothers and different devotees in Vrindavan, spent time eagerly visiting them, and took care of them. In this yatra, replacing machines, you lovingly appreciated all matajis for making chapatis and, at the same time, gave them the big opportunity to serve all Vaishnavas. How wonderfully you took care of all 12,000 devotees, giving us your divine association, mercy, and love. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for such Kartik Dham yatras. Myself and my family attended this year\u0027s yatra online, but the amazing thing was that we felt in our hearts that we were in the pandal itself. The only missing part was your and all devotees\u0027 vapu association and various services. 😔\n\n🙏 Your enlivening lectures - In every yatra, you describe almost the same pastimes of the Lord, but those are so much updated every year, and many things are new to learn from them. This year, you elaborately described the reunion of Krishna in Vrindavan after the Dwarka pastimes of the Lord, which we heard for the first time only. Your katha of pastimes are so intense, in-depth, and full of philosophical points that they really touch our hearts and increase our faith in KC. Your deep study of scriptures and commentaries of all acharyas gave us the essence of pure devotional service. Simultaneously, you set an exemplary role model for all of us through your dealings with all devotees as well as all living entities in yatras and everywhere. After every lecture, your mesmerizing Kirtans and prayers to the Lord are really blessing us, having a boosting effect on our hearts to go closer towards Krishna. All over ISKCON, you have set the highest standard of practicing KC culture. This really shows your deep absorption in Krishna and your distributing that love of Krishna to all of us, which shows us your magnanimity and compassion infused with full Gurutatva.\n\nGuruMaharaj, in all your lectures, you always explain about humility, sincerity, gratitude, and compassion, which are the topmost four qualities to perfect our life in Krishna Consciousness. We see you are the emblem or personification of these great Vaishnava qualities. You have great love and concern about Shrila Prabhupad, his instructions, and ISKCON\u0027s growth. So, you always give us the key to live happily in KC: \"to take care of each other and lovingly serve each other and ultimately serve Krishna.\" So, we surely try to follow this. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for all this.\n\nThis year, my beloved mother Shri Yashoda Devi Dasi departed from this world. Thank you, Maharaj, because, due to your causeless mercy and Lord Krishna\u0027s arrangement, she left her body completely hearing Kirtan of the holy name in the association of devotees. All this happened because you accepted her as your disciple and gave her initiation in 2014. She could live her life in the best Krishna Consciousness as your disciple. She always used to hear your translated lectures, and by seeing you speaking and serving Shrila Prabhupad in many ways, going to different countries, and traveling so far, she always got so much inspiration from you. We know that, because of her chronic illness, she couldn\u0027t do any other physical service, but she always used to read BG, SB, CC, Chaitanya Bhagvat, and Shrila Prabhupad Lilamrit short in Marathi repeatedly she read all these scriptures 3-4 times. She would sing so many Vaishnav bhajans and regularly sang all Aratis. From the day of her initiation, she chanted 32 rounds every day until her last days. Inspite of her illness, she used to do all this only by seeing you, Maharaj. So, I realize that even if somebody just sees you, they can wholeheartedly render so much service in KC. And I am sure, because of your special mercy on her, she definitely went home back to Godhead. Gurumaharaj, for this mercy, I offer my respectful gratitude from the bottom of my heart 🙏🙏🙏\n\nLastly, I beg your mercy for uplifting me from my situation in this material life and my ignorant conditional state in this life. I am very much grateful to you, Maharaj, for accepting me and my wife Parijatlila as your insignificant servants in this KC movement of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to serve all the present Acharyas and Guru Parampara, and for giving us brahmin initiation last year in 2024 even though I am not eligible for that.\n\nWithout my qualification, I sincerely pray to Lord Radha Vrindavan Chandra to bless you with a very, very healthy and long life 🙏🙏🙏\n\nGurumaharaj, on this auspicious day, please forgive all my offenses and bestow your causeless mercy upon me so that I can follow all your instructions carefully and sincerely, and try to preach KC all over and take care of my family in the best KC way, so that my both daughters, Gaurangi and Apurva, can also become instruments to serve in the mission to preach KC. I will be very fortunate if I can get a drop of any one quality from your all oceanic Vaishnava qualities. 🙏🙏🙏\n\nAll glories to Shri Guru and Gauranga 🙏🙏🙏\nAll glories to Shrila Prabhupad 🙏🙏🙏\nParam Pujya Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki Jai 🙏🙏🙏\n\n\"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna\nKrishna Krishna Hare Hare\nHare Rama Hare Rama\nRama Rama Hare Hare\"\n\nThank you very much 🙏\n\nYour Insignificant Servant,\nMudit Krishna das,\nParijat Lila Devi Dasi,\nGaurangi and Apurva.\nAnd my beloved mother Shri Yashoda Devi Dasi."

Your words have the power to transport us beyond the material dimension, allowing us to glimpse the divine pastimes unfolding in Vrindavan, Mayapur, and other sacred places. The way you unveiled the esoteric meanings behind each holy tirtha, each sacred spot where the Lord performed His pastimes, has enriched our understanding beyond measure. These are not mere stories, Guru Maharaj—through your realized devotion, they become living truths that transform our consciousness.\n\nI am eternally indebted to you for accepting this unqualified servant into the sacred Guru-Shishya Parampara. What pious activities could I have possibly performed to receive such undeserved mercy? You have given me spiritual birth, connecting me to the illustrious chain of disciplic succession descending from Sri Krishna Himself, through Lord Brahma, Narada Muni, Vyasadeva, down to our beloved Srila Prabhupada, and now to your divine self.\nYou have taken the responsibility for my spiritual advancement, and I can never repay this debt. You have planted the seed of bhakti in the barren field of my heart and continue to water it with your transcendental instructions, ensuring it grows into the creeper of devotion that will one day reach the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha-Vrindavanchandra.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I also want to express my deep appreciation for the wonderful association of my senior godbrothers and godsisters whom you have blessed me with. They are living embodiments of your teachings and have shown me such kindness, patience, and compassion. Their instructions have been invaluable guideposts on this challenging path of Krishna consciousness. When I stumble, they lift me up. When I am confused, they illuminate the way forward. When my determination wanes, they inspire me through their own exemplary dedication and service attitude. Through their association, I am learning what it truly means to be part of a Vaishnava family—how to serve with humility, how to cooperate in Krishna\u0027s mission, and how to see every devotee as more qualified than myself. They have tolerated my shortcomings with such grace and encouraged my feeble attempts at devotional service.\n\nGuru Maharaj, in this age of Kali, where maya is so strong and the pull of material desires so overwhelming, your instructions are my only shelter. Your classes, your kirtans, your personal example of pure devotion—these are the lights that guide me through the darkness of ignorance.\n\nYou have taught all of us:\n\n1. Importance of attentive chanting\n2. Following 4 regulative principles very strictly\n3. Following Dos \u0026 Don\u0027ts of NOI\n4. The art of balancing sadhana with service\n5. How to cultivate genuine humility and tolerance\n6. The necessity of studying Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books with devotion\n7. How to serve the devotee community with a mood of humble servant or servants\n8. Never aspire for any posts or positions\n\nEvery instruction you give us through your lectures is a jewel and we try to preserve it in our hearts, knowing that following your guidance is the perfection of my life.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I am very much aware of my innumerable disqualifications, my tendency toward laziness, my flickering determination, and my contaminated consciousness. Yet your mercy is so powerful that it can transform even a stone-hearted person like me. I humbly pray that you continue to engage me in the service of your mission. Please keep me close to your lotus feet and never let me stray from the path you have so lovingly shown me. May I never disappoint you or bring any disrepute to your glorious name.\n\nLet me always remember that I am nothing without your shelter, and that my only success lies in faithfully executing your instructions with a servant\u0027s heart.\n\nMy only aspiration, Guru Maharaj, is to serve you birth after birth. Whether I am in this body or another, in this realm or beyond, may I always remain your humble servant, assisting in your mission to spread the glories of Sri Krishna and the teachings of Srila Prabhupada throughout the world.\n\nThank you for everything you have given me—for the Holy Name, for Krishna consciousness, for spiritual family, for hope, for purpose, for love. You have shown me the path home, back to Godhead, and I pray I may follow it faithfully under your divine guidance.\n\nBegging to remain your eternal servant,\nYour most insignificant disciple,\nMukund Anand Das, Parameshwari DD, Vimala \u0026 Counsillees Family"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Maharaj, \n There\u0027s a famous quote which many of us young people love to cite: \"When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind.\"\n \n When I was a kid, in passively hearing your lectures with my parents who are your dear disciples Radhacaran Prabhu and Ujjvala Sakhi Devi, one word always stood out: compassion. I did not know what it meant, but I could tell it meant a lot to you.\n \n In your glorious 75 years on this planet, of which today I have spent 23 as a product of that same compassion – I know that compassion is something you not just speak of, but truly live. And by trying to follow your example, I know that one day even my mean self can begin to understand what compassion truly means.\n \n When a devotee was once almost crying for not being able to practice bhakti as much as they would like, you lovingly told them to just try and keep trying. You chose kind.\n When a simple village lady prayed for your blessings for an upcoming surgery in Hindi/Marathi, you not only understood but also deeply reciprocated to her in the best language possible. You chose kind.\n When people judged or mistreated you, you never said one bad word about them. And when people were not so nice to each other, you taught them how to love and respect. You chose kind.\n When managers for a new project could not make it work with each other, you told them to just meet ever so often and not even discuss any work. You chose kind.\n When someone once lost a lot of money for the society, you gave him a second chance - outvaluing the person beyond the possession or property. You chose kind.\n When given any opportunity to speak, you adjusted your language and manner so people can genuinely assimilate the teachings of our tradition. You chose kind.\n When your humility makes you uncomfortable at even the smallest of attention to yourself, you wrote your entire story just to help a whole world of seekers in their journey home to God and Guru. You chose kind.\n When guests were to come to GEV, instead of asking the captive audience to chant, you captivated your audience to come forward and sing on their own. You chose kind.\n When people thought to optimise for who is most important, you said that everyone who comes to Chowpatty is a VIP guest of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. You chose kind.\n When devotees pushed for pragmatism and scale, you had an eye for every little detail which is immeasurable by any scale. You chose kind.\n When others felt that donkeys serve no utility, you asked them to take care of them in your farm. You chose kind.\n And whenever a donkey like me makes an ass of himself and does not love and serve enough, you still tap his head and give him a hug. You choose kind.\n \n Thank you Maharaj for teaching us how to be kind – for every time you chose to be kind, you were actually the most right. And in my aspiration to be a beneficiary of the compassion of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Srila Prabhupada and Your Holiness, I pray I always remember and do what is right – being kind.\n \n Your servant,\n Mukund Hari"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Guru Maharaj,\n Dandvat Pranam.\n Thank you so much for accepting this lowly sinful person as your disciple and connecting me to Parampara.\n Born and brought up in Mahanubhav Panth sampradaya, I inculcated spiritual interest and inclination from my father. I was reciting Srimad Bhagavad Gita verses and also hearing Krishna\u0027s greatness in the discourses since childhood. However, my attraction for Krishna Katha and specially the sweetness of the Lord\u0027s pastimes primarily came through your merciful classes.\n Hearing your classes kept me hooked to the movement. When I went to pursue MBA at IIM and a little away from Mumbai, I thought I might not be able to continue. Hearing your classes saved me there too. And after coming back, you formally accepted me as your disciple. I understand this debt can never be paid off to the Spiritual Master.\n This year\u0027s Kartik Yatra at Govardhan was very special for various reasons. In my own little understanding, detailed Krishna Katha and especially Krishna\u0027s returning to Vrindavan pastimes amazed me. Your Srila Prabhupada consciousness throughout the Yatra, especially the evening Katha, compels me to think how one should always remember our Spiritual Master.\n I have heard so many times that Shravanam is an important limb of bhakti. And it should be processed through Mananam/Chintan to transform us for ultimate purification. With Krishna willing and your mercy, I pray to get strength to practice these principles in my life.\n ys,\n mukunda sundara dasa"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaja,\n Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n As Srila Prabhupada repeatedly emphasized that vani-seva is even more important than vapu-seva, I try to remain connected to your vani every day by listening to your classes. With whatever limited ability I have, I am trying to serve in one of your projects, while simultaneously striving to remain connected to your instructions and to remember and apply them as much as possible.\n \n In one such class, you shared a profound lesson about the story of Kailash Baba in the Himalayas. Kailash Baba didn’t know a word of English, and you didn’t know Hindi — in fact, you didn’t even know which language he was speaking. Yet the communication between both of you was completely clear. You said, “Transmission of knowledge is not just based on words; it is based on the eagerness to learn and the compassion to give. Because he so deeply cared about me and I was so eager to learn, just by his pointing his fingers and moving his eyebrows, I could understand what he was saying. And I learned more from him than I ever learned in all the schools I went to in America — because real knowledge comes through grace.”\n \n I often introspect and wonder: where am I lacking? When will I develop the eagerness to truly receive the transcendental message that is flowing through the parampara? I am certain there is no lack of compassion in you and our acharyas. You, Srila Prabhupada, and all our previous acharyas have tirelessly worked to distribute the deepest wisdom of Krishna consciousness. Yet I feel that I am the one who lacks the sincerity and eagerness to properly receive this priceless gift. And thus I continue to remain on the mental platform, without coming to the right conclusions.\n \n So, Maharaja, on this most auspicious day, my heartfelt prayer is that I may develop sincere longing and receptivity to receive the most compassionate knowledge that is coming from you — for it is the easiest and most sublime process to attain the highest perfection.\n \n Thank you very much.\n \n Your servant,\n Mukundamala Das"

We knew very well that we, being ignorant persons, do not have any qualification to glorify your wonderful qualities. But still, your favourite verse\n “Trinadapi Sunichena\n Taroriva Sahisnuna\n Amanina Manadena\n Kirtaneeya Sada Harih”\n which always emphasizes a devotee’s mood reminds us to be always humble, even while chanting the holy name. This particular instruction, which we have been hearing from you, has a significant impact on our lives. You are the embodiment of this very quality recommended by Lord Chaitanya. Then, maintaining loving relationships with the devotee community, and also your affectionate dealings with your God Brothers and God Sisters, are always an inspiration for us. Since Śravaṇam is considered the topmost process of the nine devotional processes, you have been very kind to shower your mercy by way of giving morning SB classes, as well as Sunday feast and festival classes, describing Krishna Katha and Krishna’s pastimes to us, and thus making us very fortunate to come out of the shackles of this material bondage. Annual Kartik Yatra to Brindavan, Mayapur Dhams, and other holy places is another benediction given to us to take the association of so many devotees from all around the world and taking part in various services during Yatra. This gives us a lot of insight into developing cooperation, loving relationships, and support among the devotees to make this Krishna Consciousness movement stronger, as desired by HDG Srila Prabhupada. Through your classes during Kartik Yatra, you have given us the most vital inputs and knowledge about the significance and various pastimes of the Lord and His devotees associated with those holy places. We express our profound gratitude for your affection and for providing us with ample opportunities for serving the devotee community as well as the general public through congregational preaching and especially during the Srila Prabhupada book distribution marathon. Had we not come into contact with ISKCON and Radha Gopinath Mandir, we would have been surrounded by complete ignorance and attached to material pleasures. You are our Spiritual Master, and being the representative of the Supreme Lord, you gave us the benediction for taking shelter at your lotus feet, which ultimately gives us the scope to take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna also, and thus making us so fortunate. I am personally indebted to you for a service which I got to carry out daily. I never expected this in my life.\n \n Your wonderful teachings helped us to overcome challenges, and we hope and aspire for serving this holy mission in the coming years also. We reaffirm our commitment once again and pray for your mercy that we live up to your instructions.\n \n We express our renewed dedication to our assigned services, chanting the Holy Names, studying recommended scriptures, and cooperating with other devotees to further the mission.\n \n Please bless us to always reflect an understanding of your mission, i.e., spreading the message of Lord Chaitanya, and a sincere desire to assist in that mission.\n We express our heartfelt appreciation and reaffirm our surrender and dedication to you, which is considered the highest form of worship.\n \n Haribol\n Your humble and insignificant servants\n Ujjwala radhika devi dasi\n Murali Govind dasa."

I have nothing to offer but the longing of a heart you have awakened. You are the embodiment of the mercy of Sri Sri RadhaGopinath, and it is only by Your causeless kindness that this desire to offer my heart has arisen.\n \n Your Instructions Are My Life\n \n You have taught us that the instructions of the Guru are everything. I once foolishly thought that if I could only receive personal, direct instructions for every small step, the path of bhakti would be easy. But You, in Your infinite wisdom, showed me the truth in a way I could never forget.\n \n I remember the morning I was listening to your lecture, planning my day. I had chanted my rounds and thought, \"I will complete the rest on the train.\" It seemed like a perfect, sincere plan. But then, from your own lips, you spoke the words that shook my very soul: \"We shouldn\u0027t chant in the train.\"\n \n O Gurudev! In that moment, my heart stopped. You were not just speaking to a crowd; you were sitting right beside me, guiding me, correcting me. You revealed to me that you are always with me, watching over this struggling soul. You taught me that bhakti is not about convenience; it is about consciousness. It is about offering our full, undivided attention to the Holy Names. That day, you didn\u0027t just give an instruction; you gave me the profound realization of your ever-watchful presence. It is not easy to always follow, but by your mercy, everything is possible.\n \n My Shelter and My Family\n \n Where would I be without the shelter of your words? Your lectures are my solace, my guiding light in the darkness of this age. And in your divine arrangement, you have given me another great gift: my senior godbrothers. Seeing their unwavering faith, their humility, and the way they carry you in their hearts is my constant inspiration. In their association, I feel I am always with you, for they are your true servants, fully surrendered to your mission. They are living proof of your transformative power.\n \n My Humble Prayers\n \n My only prayer, my dear Maharaj, is for your long, healthy life. Please stay with us for many, many years to come. Please continue to uplift us, to tolerate our mistakes, and to purify our duplicitous hearts. Our only responsibility is to be sincere and humble, and even that we borrow from you.\n \n I know I am the most fallen. I know I will always be the last in the queue of your followers. But I pray that you never let go of your shelter. Without it, I am nothing.\n \n Please bless me that I may someday develop a shred of genuine devotion that is pleasing to you and to Sri Sri RadhaGopinath.\n \n Your eternally indebted servant,\n Yts Murali Krishna Das"

Maharaja, you are the resemblance of the Krishna Kripa Murthi Prabhupada, where you shower mercy on this tucha jiva. Every time, your mercy is like stronger than the flow of the Ganges. We received \u0027The Journey Home\u0027 book, which is signed by your lotus hands. Whenever I see it, I can feel the connection between us. The reciprocation you give is ultimate. I was not in a state to attend this Kartik Yatra, but I was there mentally. With your causeless kripa and reciprocation, we received all the darshan every day, and the classes which made our hearts travel to Vrindavan Dham. The last class, \u0027Govardhan Parikrama\u0027, where we did manasika parikrama, but we felt like we were doing it there, having darshans. Maharaja, I believe, and that is true, that you are with everyone, where I can experience your presence and your reciprocation for my doubts. Whenever I listen to your classes, I feel you are addressing the questions which I asked you yesterday. Thanks, Maharaja, you gave us the most valuable thing you have, who is guiding us towards Bhakti. Thanks, Guru Maharaja, for everything you gave and for your causeless mercy.\n \n The second thing, I request you to bless me with Vaishnava Seva, association, and give us the strength to work in fulfilling Srila Prabhupada\u0027s mission and also to serve with humility. Thanks, Guru Maharaja, for this opportunity. Please forgive us if any mistakes were rolled out in the offering.\n Your insignificant servant,\n Navadeep"

A candidate for Krsna consciousness in the western countries should be taught about the renunciation of material existence, but one would teach candidates from countries like India in a different way. The teacher has to consider time, candidate, and country. He must avoid the principle of niyamagraha, that is, he should not try to perform the impossible. What is possible in another [country or situation], is not necessarily possible here. The acarya\u0027s duty is to accept the essence of devotional service. There may be little change here and there as far as yukta vairagya is concerned. Dry renunciation is forbidden by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and we have also learned this from our spiritual master, HH Radhanatha Swami Maharaja.

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Maharaj.\n Please accept my most humble obeisances at your transcendental, merciful lotus feet on this most auspicious occasion of your divine and glorious Vyasa Puja. I also offer my most respectful humble obeisances at the dust of your exalted parents’ lotus feet for giving us this matchless gift of your divine personality.\n \n The spiritual master comes to this material world to deliver the conditioned souls and help them on their journey back home, back to the spiritual world. Maharaj, from the very early days of your life, you exhibited the qualities of a very, very exalted, liberated soul. When you were very young, I think your father had bought a new car, and you didn’t think yourself qualified to sit on the seat, so you sat on the floor of the car. I can’t even imagine such humility in a child so young. That just goes to show how elevated and how renounced your consciousness already was. And as you grew, you progressively showed so many other qualities of a resident of the spiritual world.\n \n I offer my heartfelt thanks to His Holiness Bhakti Tirtha Swami Maharaj for lovingly asking you to write about your spiritual journey, because through your book *The Journey Home*, we get a glimpse into your wonderful characteristics. I liked the book so much that I couldn’t put it down.\n \n There are so many devotees from all over the world who want to glorify you. I would like to say that one of the highlights of my life was when I met you at one of the kirtan programs that you held. My mother had come to India at that time, so she also came to the program with me, and my Guru Maharaj introduced her to you. That was a very historic moment for both of us, my mother and me.\n \n While I was serving in Bombay, whenever my Guru Maharaj returned from traveling, and if you were also in India, there would be some big sankirtan program somewhere, or one at Chowpatty Temple. You also held many programs in Pune where I learned so much. You gave us a real taste for hearing, chanting, and kirtan. Of course, I couldn’t keep up with everybody there, but I learned that this is what real kirtan is meant to be.\n \n Maharaj, I feel that you are a real sadhu. When I stand in front of you, I know you can see right through my contaminated, dirty heart. I feel very unqualified to be in your presence, but I also feel that your presence is necessary to purify my heart, because by associating with you:\n \n sādhu-saṅga’, sādhu-saṅga’ — sarva-śāstre kaya\n lava-mātra sādhu-saṅge sarva-siddhi haya\n \n I am very grateful for your association over the years, and for the association of your disciples, who are also exemplary and very kind. I remember when I first came to India, I was the only disciple of my Guru Maharaj here. Then one or two disciples came—Kunti Devi, then Vishakhapriya. Later Siddhi Lalasa also came, but that was further down the line.\n \n Your disciples used to be so kind to us, because we didn’t know how things worked in India. It was difficult for us to have a Vyasa Puja for my Guru Maharaj, but your disciples agreed to have a small program. Lalita Sakhi had a quite big boat, and it was decided that your senior disciples and a few disciples of my Guru Maharaj would have a small program on the boat consisting of kirtans, bhajans, katha, and then, of course, prasada.\n During prasada, My Guru Maharaj was speaking to one of your disciples, and when you were going past me and you stopped where I was sitting, near the end of the boat, and you bent down a little so that I could hear you. You said, “Nama Chintamani, don’t jump off the boat.”\n I was so shocked and surprised to hear that, because at that time I was having difficulty adapting to India, and there were many challenges. I was feeling very overwhelmed. When you said, “Don’t jump off the boat,” I understood you meant, “Don’t jump off the boat of ISKCON.” So I asked you, “Maharaj, what did you say?” And you looked at me very gravely and said, “I think you heard.” You gave one of those very deep, transcendental glances and walked past. And that was the end of my peace of mind! I couldn’t eat or concentrate on anything. Those words were just reverberating in my mind: “Don’t jump off the boat.” I added in my mind, “of ISKCON.” That instruction helped me so much. It made me think about what was actually happening and realize that my problems were not so great that I needed to jump off the boat of Lord Caitanya’s movement.\n \n When you came to stay with my Guru Maharaj at Carpentaria, and it was Tamal Krishna Maharaj’s disappearance day celebration, which we celebrated at Kandarpa Manjari’s and Krishna Kirtan Prabhu’s home, about an hour’s drive from where we stayed. I think HH Niranjan Swami Maharaj was also there. I’m not sure if, at this program, Mother Yamuna and Mother Dinatarini also came, because they were living just down the road from Kandarpa Manjari’s.\n \n When it was my time to speak, I mentioned the incident where I had cooked for Tamal Krishna Goswami Maharaj and the devotees going on parikram — my Guru Maharaj’s disciples and Tamal Krishna Maharaj’s disciples during the VIHE. On Saturday, it was our day when we went on parikram. I felt that I should do some service, so I tried to make a preparation. I could see that there were too many devotees and I wouldn’t be able to manage, but I still tried, and it wasn’t such a success. I had made poha, but there was no chutney with it. And, in India, everybody knows that some preparations have to have chutney or some wet accompaniment with them.\n \n Tamal Krishna Maharaj asked, “Who cooked?” because there was no chutney. He commented, “Giriraj Maharaj should beat his women disciples — and especially Nama Chintamani. He shouldn’t let her put a foot in the kitchen.” Everybody was laughing, and my Guru Maharaj leaned over to Niranjan Swami Maharaj and you and said, “I wish I knew this earlier.” And there was more laughter.\n \n Later, another time I glorified Kunti Devi for how selflessly she served my Guru Maharaj. And on the way home, you told me that you liked my offering the best. I felt so enlivened by that. Because honestly, I didn’t think it was anything special. Yet your encouragement meant so much.\n \n I also remember that sometimes I don’t follow proper protocol. When my Guru Maharaj became very ill and had to have a bypass surgery, I was so hysterical and disturbed that I phoned the Chowpatty temple and asked to speak to you. By Krishna’s arrangement, you happened to be near the phone. I think you even picked it up. You were so calm. You said, “Don’t worry, we are all praying.” All the godbrothers were praying. Your assurance gave me so much relief, and by the mercy of the Vaishnavas my Guru Maharaj recovered.\n \n Maharaj, I want to say so much about your preaching and how you are such an exemplary devotee. You are always thinking about how to expand Srila Prabhupada’s mission and how to cultivate Vaishnava qualities in your disciples. By your example, we learn these qualities ourselves. Once HH Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaj mentioned that when he visited somewhere in South India, the devotees were so humble and wonderful. He said, “They remind me of someone, but I can’t think who.” He asked one of them, “Who is your spiritual master?” The brahmachari said, “His Holiness Radhanath Swami.” Maharaj said, “Oh! How could I not have guessed?”\n \n Your projects—GEV, the Bhakti Center in New York, and so many others—are all such incredible contributions. There are so many efforts you make that we don’t even know about, all to secure the future of Srila Prabhupada’s movement so that for the next 10,000 years, the preaching will continue to expand. Even at the cost of your health, you are ready to do anything and everything for Srila Prabhupada.\n \n I must also mention this—otherwise this offering cannot be complete. When I was in Carpinteria and you visited, I had just had a hip replacement surgery. I was moving around with a walker. After lunch one day, you saw me and asked how I was doing. You know my heart, and you knew how anxiety-stricken I was about being able to walk again. I was thinking, “How will I serve if I cannot walk?” You told me, “Don’t worry. My father had two knee replacements and He said, ‘Now I can do any damn thing I want.’” Meaning I would also recover fully. I had dreams about walking again, going up the stairs, and your words helped remove my anxiety. You encouraged me so much.\n \n I miss your personal association. Even one or two minutes with you gives me so much strength and happiness. You have been in India, and I have also been here since the end of 2023. In January 2024 I had a procedure on my spine, and now I live right opposite Bhaktivedanta Hospital. You have visited this place many times, but because of my condition, I have not been able to meet you personally. Still, I know that you know everything that is going on, and that your blessings are always with me. I thank you very much once again for your ongoing support, encouragement, and kindness.\n \n And I also dream of you sometimes.\n \n Maharaj, I thank you so much for all the wonderful association I have had with you and my Guru Maharaj. It is one of the most inspiring things in my life. Please bless us that we can develop even one drop of your amazing qualities. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for being part of my life.}}\n His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki Jai.\n His Holiness Giriraj Swami Maharaj ki Jai.\n Srila Prabhupada ki Jai.\n \n Eternally indebted and grateful to you\n Your Insignificant servant\n Nama Chintamani Devi Dasi (GRS)"

And whatever you\u0027re thinking of making — can you actually cook it?\"\n They have even eaten food cooked by us before, and we have also prepared offerings for our centre.\n So Maharaj, I went into deep thought — maybe we don\u0027t cook very well, but at least the food is edible.\n And I\u0027ve always heard that Krishna accepts whatever is offered with love.\n So I was wondering — will Krishna not accept our offering?\n And why did our higher authority, who has so much knowledge, say such things?\n Then the cooking festival got over, and we made our state\u0027s traditional dishes — patanda, kheer, and pakoras additionally.\n Then, in the evening lecture of yours, you said that Krishna is pleased with intention, and my eyes filled with tears.\n You said that this is an experience you all will never forget.\n And I was feeling happy after receiving confirmation from you that there\u0027s nothing wrong in it.\n From the Kartik Yatra 2025 book stall, I brought one of your books — Soulwise — and this book is a magical book, like a Shaka Laka Boom Boom pencil for me.\n And there\u0027s one story in the first chapter, topic \"Determination Attracts Higher Powers\" — this story is all I want.\n Maharaj, I want myself to follow Vaiṣṇavas and Ācāryas\u0027 teachings sincerely.\n Maharaj, during this yatra, your glance fell upon me and I felt like I was the happiest person.\n There are so many things I want to tell you, but I know you hear us without us even telling you.\n I just always want your kṛpā dṛṣṭi on me so that I can do my best,\n So that I too can become a part of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mission.\n Maharaj, please bless me — this fallen child just wants to learn how to stand,\n And wants to do so many things to spread this mission.\n Please bless me.\n Your servant of servants,\n Nandini 🙏"

With you, even the smallest step becomes meaningful.\n \n My biggest prayer, my deepest longing, my only dream is that one day I may receive initiation from you. I know I have no qualification. I make mistakes, I fall short, I struggle. But I also know that qualification is not created by the disciple — it is created by the mercy of the Guru. I am only praying for that mercy. I am only waiting with hope that someday you will allow me to sit at your lotus feet and receive that life-changing blessing.\n \n Guru Maharaj, you are the one who teaches me how to love Krishna, how to remember Him, how to serve Him, how to purify my heart. You are the voice that guides my lost mind back to the path of devotion. You are the place where my restless heart finally finds peace. You are the living example of Srila Prabhupada’s compassion, moving in this world to save souls like me.\n \n On this Vyasa Puja day, I want to offer you a small poem from my heart:\n \n *“Guru Maharaj…\n Your mercy is the sky,\n and I am just a small bird\n lost in its endless blue.\n \n Your words are the Ganga,\n and I am a trembling drop\n trying to merge into their purity.\n \n When my faith cracks,\n you hold it like a fragile flame\n and protect its last light.\n \n You never asked me to be perfect —\n only sincere.\n You never demanded qualification —\n only surrender.\n \n Every heartbeat of mine\n is slowly learning to beat\n in the rhythm of your teachings.\n \n If you ever look at me\n with even one drop of mercy,\n my entire destiny will change.\n \n Please allow me, one day,\n to receive initiation from you —\n not because I deserve it,\n but because your compassion\n is greater than all my faults.”**\n \n Guru Maharaj, on your divine appearance day, I bow down and offer my entire life at your lotus feet. Whatever I am, whatever I have, whatever I will ever be — I want it all to be an offering to you and Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Please accept this small, humble letter.\n Please keep your merciful glance on this insignificant soul.\n Please allow me to remain forever as a speck of dust at your lotus feet.\n Your insignificant servant,\n Nandini Gop\n eagerly waiting for your mercy."

Your story awakened a desire in me to understand Krishna more deeply and to appreciate what true humility and compassion really look like.\n \n Later, I was further inspired by my senior, who is your disciple.

By your mercy, Srila Prabhupada\u0027s mercy, and the Lord\u0027s mercy, I could overcome all obstacles on my spiritual life.\n \n I pray at your lotus feet that please bless me that my dormant faith gets strengthened, get strength to practice the limbs of bhakti, and never offend any living entity, as everyone is a servant of Gaura Chandra. I can die anytime. Wherever I may take birth, please bless me that I get the association of Vaisnavas who will guide me and engage me in the service of the Lord and Vaisnavas.

I am trying to go deep into bhakti, but somehow not able to go deep, and I am not getting that much taste. But just by doing a little bhakti, I am able to see a change in my heart. Wherever I offer bhoga to the Lord, I feel some happiness. I am trying to be consistent in bhakti, but somehow I am not able to make it. My husband also helps me in devotion. He also tries to explain what bhakti is. I also have a desire to get a great Vaisnava child, but at the same time, I don\u0027t think I am qualified to ask Krishna for this desire. Krishna knows what I want, and let Krishna only decide what he wants to give, and I will not demand him. I don\u0027t know what is right or wrong, just writing whatever is in my heart. We are just depending on him to guide us.\n \n Maharaj, I want to develop love for Krishna, practice bhakti, but somehow not able to do that. I pray that Lord Krishna and you help me to advance in bhakti. Please bless that both of us and our family will eventually take up the mission of preaching and advance in bhakti. And also, let us not desire anything other than pure devotion. We seek your blessing that whatever difficulties we may face, but we never forget Krishna.\n \n In your service,\n Navasairam, Laxmi Roja"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna, Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nDandavat pranams.\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your 75th appearance day, I find myself at a loss for words, unsure where to begin or how to fully express my feelings. There is so much I wish to convey, and the list could go on endlessly. I am deeply grateful for everything you have done for me, my family, the ISKCON movement, and countless devotees around the world. You have become a beacon of hope for so many, serving as a shining, living example of a true and genuine follower of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada—firmly rooted in the blossoming devotee tree of his spiritual legacy, as a radiant branch of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s tree of love.\nYour personal association, inspiring lectures, and exemplary actions—especially in how you interact with devotees and others—are truly remarkable. You speak exactly what others need to hear, connecting heart to heart with compassion, empathy, and sensitivity. People are naturally drawn to your personality, as you embody and radiate the all-attractive nature of Krishna.\nFrom my own interactions with you, as well as the experiences of others, I have realized that you are a bona fide ambassador of the great mahajans, carrying Krishna within your heart. It feels as though you are directly connected to the Supersoul, speaking and acting in perfect harmony with divine guidance. Your thoughts, words, and actions are perfectly synchronized, reflecting the mood and consciousness of Srimati Radharani—ever compassionate, always appreciative, seeing only the good in others, and constantly encouraging everyone. You never write anyone off, but instead offer chance after chance for improvement. The way you truly \"walk the talk\" brings everyone closer to the loving Divine Couple, following the directions of the Goswamis in pleasing service to Mahaprabhu.\nYour yatras reverberate with the mercy and compassion of Sri Nityananda Mahaprabhu. The way you guide everyone to the Dham allows us to truly see and experience the spiritual world, its divine activities, and the lilas of the Divine Couple—through your vision and presence, you become a window for us to witness what you see, as you embody compassion for countless souls and for Krishna Himself.\nThe many projects you have initiated—temples, new centers, farm communities, hospitals, eye camps, and more—are beautiful expressions of your love and dedication to your Guru Maharaj. Through these endeavors, you are setting new heights and boundaries, inspiring others to follow in your illustrious footsteps.\nIt is truly amazing, Maharaj, how you have dedicated your entire life as an Akhanda Brahmachari, like Bhishma Dev, never deviating from love and service to the mission of your Gurudeva. The example you set is extraordinary and will inspire generations to come. Though it may take me many lifetimes to follow in your footsteps, with your help and mercy, I pray that you hold me close so I may walk behind you. Perhaps one day, I will be able to do something that sincerely, selflessly, and without ulterior motives, pleases you.\nYour ever-smiling face, combined with a lion-like sobriety while serving devotees and thunderous determination in carrying forward the mission, is truly remarkable. You possess an ever-accommodating nature and a heart as soft as butter when dealing with devotees, yet you are uncompromising and disciplined with yourself, steadfast in your sadhana and principles. Your selfless giving, without expecting anything in return except the opportunity to serve, beautifully embodies the Acintya Bheda Abheda Tattva of Mahaprabhu—the sweet and loving contradictions that harmonize shastra, tattva, and rasa as illustrious ornaments.\nThese qualities attract the mood and mercy of the previous acharyas, offering hope, purpose, direction, and meaning to the lives of conditioned souls, and providing a path for them to stay and grow in spiritual life. How do you achieve this? Perhaps, with your blessings, I may one day understand a little and carry your mood as your servant of the servant.\nYou never speak of your own achievements as service to your Guru; yet, like the fragrance of a flower that cannot be hidden, your accomplishments naturally shine forth. Krishna Himself reveals you and your services to the world, showcasing your greatness even as you choose to remain humble and in the background. People from all over the world are drawn to you, just as honeybees are irresistibly attracted to nectar.\nI observe that your own godbrothers and godsisters regard you as a beacon of hope—a true preceptor and representative of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The way you interact with them, and the loving reciprocation you share, reminds me of the affectionate exchanges in Gaura Lila between Mahaprabhu and His intimate devotees. It is as if the Srimad Bhagavatam is coming to life through your actions. Despite your busy schedule, you always make time for your godbrothers and godsisters, while also maintaining a perfect balance in caring for your own disciples and the disciples of other gurus.\nMany devotees share their personal observations, interactions, and experiences with you across various situations and circumstances. The common thread in all these accounts is your unwavering consistency—always grateful, humble, and eager to serve, without any conditions, reservations, or limitations.\nOn a personal level, my interactions with you during your visits to Columbus—whether staying at our home, driving you locally, or going out for walks—are cherished memories that I will relish for the rest of my life. These moments are truly your causeless mercy, which I feel undeserving of, yet I continually hanker for them, as they keep me alive on the path of Bhakti, inspiring me to remain enthusiastic, grateful, and determined to continue, no matter what challenges arise. Your prayers for our family Vrajabhakti, Narahari Rupa, and Parikshith, and your kind support during times of need, though we may not deserve them, are like a lighthouse guiding our boat through the storms of life.\nI pray to Lord Narasimha Deva for your health and physical well-being, asking Him to grant you a long, healthy life so that you may continue to save and guide countless souls who are searching for Krishna, yearning to advance on the path of Bhakti, and struggling for strength, hope, and direction to make their lives meaningful.\nMaharaj, I am eternally grateful to you. No matter what I do, I can never repay you for all that you have given me, though I do not deserve it. Please bless me so that I may always remain connected to you and your mission, stay steadfast on the path of Bhakti, and continue to serve you in a way that pleases you, no matter what challenges arise.\nThank you very much.\nYour servant of servant,\nNaveen Krishna Das\nISKCON Columbus\nBoard of Directors and Temple Management"

        "Your Offering ":  "Namo om viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-pṛṣṭhāya bhūtale\nśrīmate rādhānātha-svāmin ity amine\n\nAll glories to you Guru Maharaj.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nAll glories to Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga!\n\nYou saved me from this material life. Through your lectures, personality, and life, you emphasized so much becoming a genuinely humble servant of the Lord by serving His dear devotees, and by that only we can achieve all perfection. I was and still am very much embarrassed with material sense gratification, even after coming into devotional service, but by your merciful teachings, I am trying to hear your vani as much as possible and by seeing your followers, how they are blissfully practicing your instructions and advancing in their spiritual life. Your vani and followers of your Vani are saving me from getting burned in the forest fire of my anarthas. By showering the rain of your selfless love and compassion, which we can feel, you are extinguishing the fire. Therefore, I offer my most respectful obeisances unto your Lotus feet.\n\nYou have so much taste for kirtan, following the footsteps of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. One devotee friend was sharing with me that if one wants to experience the dancing LCM, one should see your dance. I am not very much qualified to witness all your pastimes physically, but by participating in your Annual Kartik Yatra, which is so dear to you, which is your very expression of compassion and your gratitude to Srila Prabhupada as mentioned by your divine self, we are getting a fortunate entry into the ocean of your bliss. It is as if we are in the Spiritual World. The way you make all your dear sons and daughters chant together with a full heart, not letting us hold anything back, to cry out for the mercy of the Lord, is simply very fulfilling to our hearts. And you make us dance there in your ecstatic kirtan for the pleasure of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. I simply offer my most humble obeisances unto your divine Lotus feet.\n\nYou have so much taste for serving the Deities. I was amazed to come to know that your divine self has very blissfully served the deities with so much love and sacrifice for about 8 years in such an austere condition in New Vrindavan. And you taught us that Deities will be most pleased if we are serving and pleasing His devotees with humility and love. And you have created so many engagements to make sure all your disciples are blissfully engaged in serving the Lord through preaching, temple building, cleaning, cooking, assisting. And you like so much to see the Deities getting served nicely. Once you saw that all Tulsi Maharanis were not in good health due to improper care, and you decided to fast until you see the Tulsi Maharani is responsibly getting served by your dear disciples. I offer my humble obeisances unto your Lotus feet, so that I can assist those who are assisting you in pleasing the Lord.\n\nYou love to feed the Lord with all various kinds of foodstuffs. And you are glad to see your devotees cooking, serving, assisting, and honoring prasadam, that I could witness in the Annual Kartik Yatra. There are so many items, different types of sweets every day, all made not just to feed devotees but to please and satisfy the devotees. And how nicely you have empowered your disciples with your humble service attitude that is visible in the Yatra, where every devotee is just wanting to serve everyone, in whatever possible way, sacrificing his/her own comforts. Many rolling chapatis the whole day, many washing plates of devotees, and it is countless. We are so much blessed to learn from you the secret of true happiness in selflessly serving and pleasing the Vaishnavas. I offer my humble obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\n\nYou always find the opportunity to chant and glorify the names, forms, qualities, and pastimes of the Lord. So many times, you have mentioned that with your dear Godbrothers, like HH Bhakti Tirth Swami Maharaj, HH Tamal Krishna Goswami Maharaj, and others, you have cherished their association by discussing hours of Kṛṣṇa-kathā, sometimes all night. You always keep chanting the names of the Lord. You are like an active soldier of Lord Chaitanya, who relishes to be on the field, preaching the glories of the Lord. You churn out newer and newer ways to reach the fallen souls like us and somehow give them the mercy of Srila Prabhupada. I offer my most humble obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\n\nYou are expert in assisting the Servants of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath in Their conjugal pastimes. You have manifested the Vrindavan, not to replace the original Vrindavan but to deepen our feeling and meditation on the real spirit of Vrindavan, following in the footsteps of our previous Acaryas in manifesting their Gupta Vrindavan. Srila Prabhupada once said that assisting the Gopis in serving the conjugal pastimes of Sri Sri Radha Kṛṣṇa is non-different from distributing his books to everyone. And you showed last year how you have assisted and honored Srila Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj by distributing 6.5 lac+ books through your servants in a way never done before. I offer my humble obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\n\nYour personality and lectures are very much in line with your Spiritual Master, and because you are always meditating on the personality of Srila Prabhupada, we can factually feel his presence in your personality. All the scriptures and saintly persons have confirmed to see the Lord in the personality of one\u0027s Guru, who is the via transparent medium of the whole parampara. And because you are so dear to Kṛṣṇa, you are His very confidential representative. I offer my humble obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\n\nIf we get your mercy, we are sure to get Krishna\u0027s mercy. But without your mercy, there is no chance of getting Krishna\u0027s mercy. In one of your lectures 2009, Kolkata, you have expressed the desire to develop Kolkata, the birthplace of Srila Prabhupada. And many of your dear servants are putting their life and soul to fulfill your desire to glorify Srila Prabhupada. I am very much unqualified; that\u0027s why Kṛṣṇa put me so far from Kolkata, so that I can become more sincere and serious in bhakti. I am begging you for your mercy and all necessary qualifications so that I can get the opportunity to serve in the proper mood in whatever insignificant way. May I develop a drop of those qualities of humility and tolerance that you expect from your every student. I wish to remember you always, begging at your Lotus Feet to be able to serve in a way that pleases you and so Kṛṣṇa. I offer my most humble obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\n\nSeeking for genuine humility and devotion,\nTrying to realize my glorious insignificant position,\nYour servant\u0027s servant.\nNaveen Kumar."

        "Your Offering ":  "14 November 2025\n\nDear Guru Maharaja,\nPlease accept our humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet.\nAll glories to Sri Guru, Gauraṅga, and Srila Prabhupada!\n\nDear Gurudeva,\n\nWe were recently hearing your lecture from the Govardhan Yatra, where you narrated the profoundly touching pastime of Siva Koṛi—the helpless she-jackal who was chased, beaten, and trapped in a pit of fire by cruel boys, only to be saved by the compassionate glance of Srimati Radharaṇi and Lalita Sakhi.\n\nThis narration deeply moved our hearts and revealed several transformative lessons:\n\n1.        The Jackal Is Our Condition\nYou explained that the jackal represents us—the conditioned souls lost in the dense forest of material existence, scavenging for fleeting pleasures amidst decay. We are pursued by the three modes of nature—the boys symbolizing our lust, anger, and greed—who pelt us with anxieties and beat us with the stick of repeated birth and death. Finally, we fall into the pit of illusion, surrounded by the flames of samsara, burning with regret, fear, and unfulfilled desires—utterly helpless.\n2.        The Fire Is Our Existence\nThe blazing fire around the pit is the samsara-davanala—the all-consuming forest fire of material life. From within that pit, our cries for help are weak and distorted, just like the jackal’s painful howls. We cannot save ourselves.\n3.        Lalita Sakhi Is the Guru\nJust as the jackal’s cry reached the merciful ears of Srimati Radharaṇi, our sincere—though feeble—prayers reach you, Gurudeva. You, as Lalita Sakhi, respond to our cries, dispelling the boys of material attachment, extinguishing the fire of suffering with the cool water of your instructions, and lifting us from the darkness of ignorance. Your compassionate glance alone purifies our hearts and fills them with hope.\n4.        Transformation Through Service\nThe jackal did not become a lion or a swan; she was transformed by mercy into an eternal attendant in Radha-Govinda’s pastimes. Likewise, you teach us that spiritual transformation does not lie in becoming great scholars or powerful preachers, but in embracing our humble position as servants of the servants—finding joy in assisting the Lord’s devotees and delighting in the service of Sri Sri Radha-Govinda.\nGurudeva, just as the jackal was uplifted by the merciful glance of Srimati Radharaṇi, we too—though distracted and undeserving—are being rescued by your compassion and guided by your kirtan. You are personally leading us from the darkness of selfishness into the light of selfless devotion.\n\nWe pray that, like that jackal, we may gain the humility to bow before the devotees, to receive their merciful glance, and to be eternally engaged in the loving service of Srimati Radhika.\nWe have no qualification, no devotion, and no love—but we have your mercy. Please allow us to remain, always, in the mood of that jackal: helpless yet hopeful, unworthy yet uplifted, forever aspiring to be the humble servants of the servants of Srimati Radharaṇi.\n\nThe Soulful Call of Your Kirtan\nWe also wish to offer our heartfelt gratitude for the kirtans you led during the Yatra. They were not mere melodies but divine invocations—soulful calls that pulled our distracted minds toward the Lord. We were reminded of the pastime of Srila Prabhupada in Tompkins Square Park, where through three hours of kirtan he opened his eyes to find hundreds of souls gathered—the holy name itself having awakened their dormant devotion. Similarly, your kirtans are spiritual lifelines; they purify the atmosphere, exhilarate the heart, and connect us to you, to Srila Prabhupada, and to Sri Gauraṅga in shared transcendental joy. Through them, we feel inspired, grounded, and eager to serve Sri Guru and Gauraṅga.\n\nYour insignificant servants,\nNavin Gopal das, Swamini Radhika Devi dasi, and Ishwari"

Please kindly forgive any shortcomings in my offering. I feel extremely fortunate to receive this opportunity to write something for you, Guru Maharaj.\n\nYou possess countless divine qualities, Guru Maharaj—truly without limit. But the quality that touches my heart the most is your profound humility. For you, everyone is equal. No one is big and no one is small. You look upon every soul with compassion, and you always remind us in your lectures to love everyone and to see everyone as a child of God.\n\nAnother lesson I have learned from you is to show gratitude—even for the smallest service someone has done for us. You teach us to appreciate each other sincerely. You also teach that if someone is pleasing Krishna, then we should become that person\u0027s servant of the servant, and by doing so we can receive Krishna’s mercy.\n\nThrough you I have also understood that bhakti means to be enthusiastic, surrendered, and determined on the path of devotional service.\n\nAnd one more thing—your personal example of *simple living and high thinking* deeply inspires me. You and your disciples embody this principle perfectly.\n\nI pray at your lotus feet that, by your blessings, I may develop true humility, compassion, and gratitude for all. I also pray that I can chant more attentively and sincerely.\n\nLastly, Guru Maharaj, I pray that by your mercy, I may soon receive the opportunity to take your darshan in person. I have been waiting for this moment for the past five years.🙇‍♀️🙏\n\nYour inspired disciple 🙇‍♀️\nNavita"

In the same way, saints, listening to the words of good and bad people, create a sweet taste in the form of sweet words.\n\nHis holiness Gurumaharaj  Radhanath Swami is such a great person who listened to various words,  interact various people and went through various situations, but after taking education from everyone, he presented before us a great book \u0027Journey Home\u0027 containing sweet Sukta Rasa i.e. very sweet words. \n After reading this book many people have become, are becoming and will become devotees.\n One or two examples from the unique journey of Guru Maharaj Ji \n\n I will present to you: \nHow the mongoose sat on Maharaj Ji\u0027s neck, and Maharaj Ji remained motionless for six hours, and his neck began to pain.From this incident, Guru Maharaj taught that \"\"this mongoose may have been sent to teach me the sacred virtue of patience and tolerance. True wisdom lies in turning adversity into an opportunity for progress.\"\"\n\nAnother example: When his bag full of books was lost, he was a little disappointed, but then learned from it and taught us that \"\"It is the nature of the mind to consider the unnecessary as necessary. The mind creates artificial needs, believing that it cannot live without them. Thus, we carry the heavy burden of attachments throughout our lives. But if we find joy within ourselves, we will always live a life free from many complications.\"\"\n In this way, Guru Maharaj Ji, by learning from the adverse circumstances of his own life, imparted education to all of us and doing all good for us.\n\nHeartfelt gratitude\n\nMahaprabhu Kirtan Das\nand\nNavya Lalita Devi Dasi\""

But by Srila Prabhupada’s mercy, I came into the association of your devotees, and through them, I received you. That was when everything began to change.\n\nYour compassionate guidance revealed to me a world filled with purpose, devotion, and the shelter of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. The moment I learned how Srila Prabhupada pointed toward this area and said, “There should be a temple here,” I understood that my connection to Their Lordships is entirely your and Srila Prabhupada’s mercy. I have never felt such deep attachment to anyone as I feel for Radha Gopinath.\n\nLast year, when I shifted to a new place, I feared losing sangha. But again, your influence was evident. The devotees welcomed me with such warmth and love that I understood—you have created a global family where no one ever feels alone.\n\nMaharaj, whatever little transformation I see in myself - any faith, any humility, any service mood - is only because of your teachings. You once said, “Our real success is how sincerely we serve.” These words constantly guide me, especially when I struggle with seva or lose focus.\n\nOn this blessed day, I offer my gratitude at your lotus feet and pray for only one thing: please bless me with sincerity, steadiness, and the taste to serve Srila Prabhupada’s mission with love. Let me never lose the essence of bhakti or forget Krishna as the center.\n\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for giving direction to my life, for giving me family, and for giving me the shelter of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. I pray to remain your servant, lifetime after lifetime.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nNidhi Tiwari"

Actually, you had once mentioned in one of your lectures that a true devotee of the Lord celebrates the birth of Krishna every moment, since Krishna gets born in his heart every moment. Similarly, we aspire to glorify with all gratitude your presence in our lives every moment, considering every moment to be a milestone moment. Your impact in our daily lives, for whatever one does, has been influenced by your positivity through both vani and vapu. All answers to every possible problem, query, and understanding are embedded in your lectures. These lectures are a one-stop solution or a universal key to open the doors towards spiritual clarity, which can, of course, be implemented as successfully for material aspects too.\n\nMaharaj, it certainly will not be out of place to say that you really ‘walk the talk’. As a matter of fact, you more than exemplify your teachings through your actions and dealings with all kinds of people. In all these years, we have seen you giving equal mercy and blessings to people irrespective of their caste, creed, economic status, etc. My father, a few months before passing away, did mention that what he saw at Ratna Manjari’s and Priyavrata’s wedding was a pinnacle of genuine love and blessings that they got from the devotees, which was priceless and that no billionaire could have acquired it with all his money. He continued saying that it all converges to your Guru Maharaj.\n\nYour ‘simple love sacrifice’ for bringing the public at large, and especially devotees, closer to the Lord can easily be compared to a biological parent nurturing a child with total affection and a similar level of sacrifice. The only difference is that a parent nurtures two or three kids on an average at one time, while you do thousands.\n\nWe have to just find out at our end how to fully give our hearts to you, even if it is a fraction of what and how you have submitted it to your spiritual master.\n\nWe seek your blessings and prayers for all of us and thank the Lord profusely that He has bestowed into us such a big fortune, personified as H.H.

Though it was your special day, you were the one serving, giving us the priceless gift of connecting to Krishna. I remember that sacred moment in Farmington Hills, your gentle voice asking which Deities in New Vrindaban I would like to worship. That question felt like the Lord Himself entering my life in a new and intimate way.\n\nHere in New Vrindaban, I often think of your vision — to build communities that reflect the mood of Vrindavan, where everyone can feel loved, needed, and inspired to serve. As I offer my small creative service through design and art, I pray that my work may carry even a drop of your spirit — to uplift hearts and glorify devotees.\n\nWhenever I see you — at Kartik Yatra or at any gathering, large or small — I am always struck by how many people are drawn to you, their devotion magnified simply by your presence. Yet amidst that ocean of disciples and followers, you remain intimately present to every individual soul. Even a brief interaction with you feels deeply personal — as if, in that moment, time stops and there is only you and me.\n\nJust as during my second initiation in Farmington Hills, when we sat like that — you and I — these moments, which remain eternally in my memory, help me practically understand how Krishna is personally with every soul — present to each individually. There are countless beings, yet there is one Krishna, and one Guru who connects each of us to Him.\n\nGuru Maharaj, you have taught me that every moment can be an offering. Whether I’m painting, designing, or walking among the cows and hills, I feel your voice within calling me to anchor everything in gratitude. Please bless me that I may deepen my sincerity and become an instrument of your compassion. May my hands serve, my words uplift, and my heart and soul remain always at your lotus feet.\n\nThank you for your love, patience, and mercy.

Your divine glance, your ocean-like humility, your soothing aura, and your gentle words pierced through all the layers of my hardened heart.\n I am an unworthy, flawed, and helpless conditioned soul full of imperfections and failures. Yet something in me cries out for the shelter of your lotus feet. Gurudev, I beg you… please accept me. Please let me serve you. My only wish is to live and die in the warmth of your loving instructions, always trying, however imperfectly, to follow your guidance.\n I don’t understand why this feeling arose, why this connection appeared so suddenly and so powerfully. All I know is that you are my Gurudev. On Gopashtami, when you made that sweet, childlike “moo” sound of the cows, it pierced my unstable, shaking mind like a ray of mercy. Something deep inside me broke open… and I knew that your love is real, your compassion is real, your shelter is real.\n Gurudev, please… keep me close to your service. I have no genuine love for Radha Gopinath, no purity in my chanting, no devotion in my heart. But in your presence, I feel held. I feel seen. I feel sheltered. I feel as if, for a moment, I am no longer lost.\n Your words, your smile, your mercy—they are the only things that give me hope. Please guide me to your lotus feet.

Today, more than ever, I feel how blessed I am to have found you — or rather, how blessed I am that you allowed me to be found by your compassion.\n \n Guru Maharaj, you have not only guided my life…\n you have given me a new life.\n \n Before coming under your shelter, I never truly understood what it meant to live with purpose, with service, with hope, and with the longing to please Krishna. You awakened something in my heart that I did not even know existed. Through your teachings, your gentle presence, and your unending compassion, you gave meaning to my existence.\n \n When you accepted me as your disciple on 10th September, 2024, it felt as if my life was restarted — cleansed, redirected, purified. After almost ten years of waiting, when you spoke my name as “Nilachal Bihari Das,” it felt like Krishna Himself was giving me a second birth. That moment is the greatest gift I have ever received in this life.\n \n Guru Maharaj, sometimes when I hear you speak about compassion, humility, forgiveness, and love for all beings, I feel both inspired and ashamed. Inspired — because I long to follow your footsteps. Ashamed — because I realize how far I am from your qualities. I often ask myself:\n \n When will I truly become grateful?\n When will I see others with kindness?\n When will my heart soften like yours?\n When will I become even a drop of what you represent?\n \n But then I remember…\n It is only by your mercy that transformation becomes possible.\n \n Guru Maharaj, I do not pray for anything material.\n I do not pray for comfort, success, or recognition.\n I pray only for the strength to serve you,\n the sincerity to follow your instructions,\n and the purity to honor the vows you have allowed me to take.\n \n Please bless me so that I may never forget the shelter you have given me, nor waste a single moment of this rare human life. Please guide me so that I may live each day in a way that brings a small smile to your lotus face.\n \n On this holy day, I offer my heartfelt prayers to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, Sri Gauranga Mahaprabhu, and Srila Prabhupada to give you unlimited health, strength, and divine energy so you may continue illuminating the hearts of millions.\n \n Guru Maharaj, thank you for giving me shelter.\n Thank you for giving me identity.\n Thank you for giving me direction.\n Thank you… for giving me life.\n \n Your aspiring servant,\n Nilācala Bihāri Dāsa"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my most humble and repeated obeisances at your divine lotus feet.\n All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n \n On this sacred occasion of your 75th Vyasapuja, I bow with a heart filled with deep gratitude. Whatever I express here is only a very small attempt to glorify you, for your qualities are unlimited, while my ability is extremely limited. Still, the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition teaches that glorifying the spiritual master is a sacred duty of the disciple, and therefore I offer this humble submission at your lotus feet.\n \n This past year has been the most transformative year of my life. By your causeless mercy, I received initiation from you on Dussehra day in Nashik. The four days of your association during that time were deeply life-changing. Your kīrtans, your gentle presence, and your compassionate dealings with each devotee made me feel that Krishna’s kindness was directly touching my heart. Although many devotees were gathered, you made each of us feel personally acknowledged. Such attention and affection are the true signs of a pure Vaishnava.\n \n Receiving your shelter opened my eyes to my own weaknesses. I see how restless and proud my mind often is, how easily I become distracted, and how quickly I forget spiritual priorities. Yet, instead of discouragement, your example fills me with hope. Your teachings guide me in every area of life—whether in my duties at MSEDCL, in family responsibilities, or when I attempt to preach in villages with hesitation and lack of confidence. Your words and actions show me how to live with sincerity, humility, and dedication.\n \n Guru Maharaj, on 7th August 2025, by your blessings and by Krishna’s mercy, my wife and I were gifted with a baby boy. We feel that he has come into our lives through the prayers and blessings of Vaishnavas. Our sincere desire is that he may grow up imbibing the qualities you embody—compassion, simplicity, gratitude, service, and devotion to the Holy Name. We pray that our home becomes a place where your teachings are practiced daily and where the Holy Name remains the center of our lives.\n \n Your life, Guru Maharaj, is a living example of Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy. The scriptures declare sākṣād-dharitvena samasta śāstraiḥ—that the guru is the transparent representative of the Supreme Lord—yet simultaneously the most humble servant. Both these truths shine beautifully in you. Your humility reminds me of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who considered himself lower than the straw in the street. Your compassion echoes the boundless mercy of Nityānanda Prabhu. Your unwavering dedication to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mission reflects the spirit of the Six Gosvāmīs, who lived only for Mahāprabhu’s purpose.\n \n Your kīrtans awaken devotion.\n Your lectures illuminate the heart.\n Your personal example inspires transformation.\n \n Through your life, I understand in a practical way the qualities that Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī described in a pure Vaishnava—expert engagement, gentleness, gratitude, and boundless compassion. To witness these qualities in a living person is the greatest fortune of my life.\n \n Despite your mercy, I remain full of shortcomings. My chanting often lacks depth, my mind becomes restless, and my service attitude is inconsistent. Yet I continue to hold on to your teachings with sincerity, hoping to grow steadily in spiritual life. I pray that I may develop deeper devotion, humility, and steadiness in my practices. I pray that my responsibilities as a householder and as a servant in my profession become offerings that reflect the values you teach. I aspire to assist, even in small ways, in sharing Krishna consciousness through my behavior and interactions with others.\n \n Guru Maharaj, if I can imbibe even a fraction of your compassion, my life will become meaningful. If I can remember your teachings during difficult moments, I will remain protected by the strength they carry. Your instructions are a guiding force in my life, giving clarity and direction in times of uncertainty.\n \n On this most auspicious 75th Vyasapuja, I offer my heart, my family, my abilities, and my future at your lotus feet. Whatever little I have, may it be used in ways that bring joy to your heart and contribute to your mission.\n Your servant,\n Niladri Das 🙏"

In 2019, after having a meeting with you along with Dayaram P and the temple council on building a gorgeous temple in Kolkata, you told us - \"I am giving you my heart.

Each path we walk in GEV seems to echo your compassion and the timeless grace of Sri Vrindavan-dham. The scriptures remind us that only through the causeless mercy of a true resident of Vrindavan can one awaken pure affection for the Divine Couple. Dear Gurumaharaj, through your care and your wisdom, you have opened that doorway for us, shielding us tenderly through our services and responsibilities.\n\nWe pray for your blessings to grow worthy of approaching this sacred, numinous realm, without letting the small distractions of life pull our hearts away from the path you have set before us.\n\nYour servants\nNimai Lila Das\nVrinda Lila Devi Dasi\nLila Gayatri"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Maharaj! Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n\nMaharaj, today on this auspicious 75th appearance day of your Vyas puja, I can show my utter gratitude at your lotus feet for showing incomparable compassion on a fallen soul like me.\n\nMaharaj, I have been hearing your lectures, and your each lecture is again and again emphasizing on cultivating the pure devotional service which is unconditional, unmotivated, pure love for Lord Hari.\nYou are yourself a representation of pure devotional act. I have seen you, Maharaj, during a New York Snan Yatra this year where you had come to the temple in New York and there were a lot of devotees engaged in carrying out Jagannath Snan Yatra. I was able to see how Jagannath, Subhadra, and Baldev were getting Abhishek and everyone was just engaged in watching that, but Your focus was just Radhakrishna and that shows the pure devotion and utter focus on Vraja Bhakti which you carry in your heart. You did not want to see Dwarkadish Krishna as Jagannath when you can see Radha Krishna in front of you.\nYour mood of devotion is not evoked by Krishna\u0027s greatness but by the pure love you have for Krishna as He is. Just like the Vraj Gopis ignored Narayan and just asked where is Krishna, or when Radharani and the Gopis saw Krishna as King of Dwarka during Kurukshetra did not accept Him as king but in their hearts prayed, \"You are the same Shyam Sundar,\" they said, \"and we are the same gopis—but the environment is different. Here, you are majestic, royal, formal. We miss the Shree Krishna who used to steal butter, who used to play the flute in the forests of Vrindavan. Please, come back to Braj with us.\" Same way you are highly focused in seeing Krishna in Vridavan mood, then as Dwarkadish Krishna in Jagannath form.\nTo unlock this Vraj Bhakti, you have been emphasizing the \"key\":\nतृणादपि सुनीचेन तरोरपि सहिष्णुना।\nअमानिना मानदेन कीर्तनीयः सदा हरिः\nOver and over again. Thus, I am able to see how you are taking us all towards Raganuga Bhakti where love for Krishna is natural and not motivated through following of Shastra injunctions.\nI also thank you, Maharaj, for blessing us with various services here in ISKCON Vadodara and your mood of keeping Krishna’s pleasure first, helping us move on with our service in spite of great difficulties, as we know even with all the difficulties, if we are able to get a small smile on Krishna’s and Radha’s face, that’s success. We found from nowhere Gauranga Prabhu calling us to start Madan Mohan Thali, and we were able to insignificantly serve by providing inputs for the same. And meeting you was just unimaginable reciprocation we could have had.\nI pray that we always remain in the service of Srila Prabhupada’s mission and able to serve you and please you by keeping Krishna’s pleasure first, then our own agenda or pleasures. I pray if I had committed knowingly or unknowingly any offense to your lotus feet, please forgive me, considering me an insignificant servant at your lotus feet.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nNimai Nitai Das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurumaharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances, all glories to Srila Prabhupada and all glories to you.\n On birthdays, it is customary to offer gifts, yet I am here today wondering what I can possibly offer you. Instead, I am wondering how I can repay you for the most amazing gift you have given me and keep giving each year, your shelter. Senior devotees have said that you like to know that your disciples pay close attention to your classes and reflect on your message. So, with this in mind, I would like to share a few thoughts in relation to what I have heard from you recently.\n \n In one of your classes, you mentioned how it is important that we go deep within our hearts to reflect on what we hear and think hard about our understanding. Then we will realize that we cannot actually understand Krishna because how can you understand that the unborn is born and the inactive is active. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu gave this as achintya bheda bheda tattva, but only when Krishna chooses to reveal this in our hearts, we will be able to understand Krishna. In life, we are trained to plan and maintain control of our lives, so sometimes it feels impossible to let go. Due to your regular classes, you remind us to give up the ego and simply surrender. I may be very far from this surrender, but I am hopeful that due to your constant reminders and shelter, I may one day accept Krishna’s promise of protection by simply holding onto your lotus feet.\n \n Recently, I met someone who was asking how we can see all the problems in the world with a spiritual lens. I shared with her something you had said in a class. You had shared that the soul is selfless, but due to the bodily conception and external influences, we forget our true purpose. Therefore, we may not be able to change what we see, but we can try to change the way we live, and by taking shelter of devotees, we learn to serve and share a higher purpose with the world. We may not be able to control the chaos in what we see, but perhaps we can bring some stability into the chaos that otherwise remains in our hearts.\n \n Recently, you were in London, and I was simply observing how you were trying to be personal with each and every one of us immediately after a long flight that had been delayed. You gave a class and described the rasa lila pastime on sharad Purnima, but I was amazed at how you took such an intimate lila and were able to share this in such an expert manner, keeping us focused on the key principles on just how deep Krishna’s love goes. I look back at the first time I met you in New Vrindavan, and even though you had so many responsibilities, I noticed your simplicity in the way you interacted with others, the way in which you attended classes given by others, the way you would call everyone prabhu, which you do even today, and how when the retreat was over, you came with your bag, loaded it in your car, and then drove off. At that point, I knew you were someone special and that I longed for more of your association.\n \n Thank you so much for your incredible classes that somehow keep everyone wanting more and for genuinely showing us how to love and care for others.\n \n I ask for your blessings that I can be a good disciple and that I am constantly reminded by you and others to be the servant of the servant of the servant. I will continue to hear your words daily so that I can bathe and cleanse my impurities gradually by your mercy.\n \n Your disciple and servant,\n Nimaicandra das"

You have shown that spiritual life is not merely a set of practices but truly a journey back to our real home — the eternal abode of Lord Krishna.\n\nAs a housewife and mother navigating family responsibilities, I constantly draw strength and inspiration from your teachings. You have taught us that every act of service, however small, becomes an offering of devotion when done with sincerity and full consciousness of Krishna.\n\nYour compassion, endless patience, and personal example of living for others have been my guiding light.\n\nYour humorous yet deeply impactful way of communication always touches hearts. Once, when a devotee said he could not attend yatra because he did not have “leaves” from his office, you lovingly handed him some dry leaves and said, “Here are the leaves.”\nSuch simplicity, warmth, and wisdom reflect your divine nature — teaching profound lessons with a gentle smile.\n\nYour surrender to Srila Prabhupada and complete dedication to Lord Krishna constantly remind me of the true purpose of human life — to serve the Lord and His devotees with love and devotion. You have transformed hearts not merely by your words but through your personal example of purity, forgiveness, and deep spiritual insight.\n\nOn this sacred occasion, I pray for your continued health, strength, and divine presence so that you may keep inspiring the world with your matchless compassion.\n\nPlease, Guru Maharaj, bless me that I may follow your instructions faithfully and serve in a way that brings even a small happiness to your heart and contributes to Srila Prabhupada’s glorious mission.\n\nWith deep gratitude and affection,\n\nYour insignificant servants,\nNimisha Agrawal\nMukund Agrawal Son, 10 yrs.\nIshaan Agrawal Son, 8 yrs."

First of all, I thank you for accepting me as your disciple out of your completely causeless mercy. Whatever little meaning, direction, or purpose has come into my life is solely because of your compassion.\n\nGurudev, you have moulded my life in such a beautiful way that a previously directionless existence has now taken a clear and firm spiritual direction. When I was emotionally devastated, disturbed, and struggling in confusion—though striving for some material clarity due to poverty but lost on emotional, social, intellectual, and spiritual levels—you opened for me the doors to the palace of spiritual mercy.\n\nBy your grace, I found a wonderful family of envy-free Vaiṣṇavas, mentors like Paramhansa Prabhu, loving guides, and heartfelt association. Daily Bhāgavatam, weekly programmes, cooking and assisting in prasadam services became festivals that purified my mind and shaped my character. In those days, even before marriage, I would not utter a single harsh word to anyone—and I know this was entirely your mercy through the pure association of your devotees.\n\nIf today I find myself complacent or not taking full advantage of the precious association of your senior disciples—who are yourself in mirrored form—it is my shortcoming alone. Yet they continue to tolerate, forgive, and shower kindness on an insincere soul like me, exactly as you do.\n\nMaharaj, my whole life without you has no meaning. Any achievement or honour I have received, though undeserved, is only your and Srila Prabhupada’s grace. Please bless me with proper consciousness to serve all patients as the honoured guests of Krishna and Prabhupada, the way you expect.\n\nYour unwavering faith in the Vedas has planted faith in my own heart. The way you decode deep spiritual truths with such simplicity, sweetness, and profound realization is divine. Absorption, integrity, compassion, forgiveness, foresight, positivity, innovation in preaching, gentleness, attentiveness, uncompromising commitment to absolute truth—yet softness like lotus petals—these dimensions of your personality continue to inspire me deeply.\n\nI am ever grateful that you, Krishna, and the senior Vaiṣṇavas have allowed and tolerated an insignificant soul like me, giving me opportunities to serve according to my small capacity. Please kindly take care of your health. I pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath for your strong, vibrant, and long life so that your magnanimous desire to spread Krishna’s mercy may reach every heart.\n\nOn your sacred Vyasa-puja day, I offer my promise to walk the path you expect from me, to the best of my ability, with sincerity and devotion.\n\nThank you, Gurudev, for coming into our lives and illuminating our hearts with Krishna’s love.\n\nYour insignificant servant \nNirmalchandra Das"

Thank you for connecting me to the glorious paramparā Brahma-Madhva–Gaudiya Paramparā by accepting me as your disciple. Although I am not qualified, this is only because of your causeless mercy upon this fallen soul. I remember the countless struggles you underwent in your search for the ultimate path of perfection—how you came across HDG Śrīla Prabhupāda in Mumbai, then in Vṛndāvana, and finally your search ended when you accepted HDG Śrīla Prabhupāda as your spiritual master. I am reminded of your pastimes described in Journey Home and in New Vrindavan, where you sacrificed so much—enduring severe cold, not having water to bathe, and sleeping hardly an hour—simply to please your spiritual master.\n \n I express my heartfelt gratitude to you, as I personally witnessed your magnanimity during this year’s Kartik Yatra 2025 at Govardhan. It is the result of your compassion, humility, countless sacrifices, and the inconveniences you take upon yourself to give Krishna to all of us.\n \n This time I could understand why you always say in your lectures that one cannot go to Vṛndāvana simply by purchasing a ticket. The most important thing is the consciousness with which we visit the holy places. You have shaped the consciousness of thousands of devotees before visiting sacred places through your nectarean kathās in the tent. In my whole life I had never heard Krishna’s pastimes described in such a way—as if you had personally witnessed them unfolding in Vṛndāvana itself. Speaking continuously in the same posture without water, narrating Krishna’s līlā in such depth—it felt as if I was hearing from Krishna’s confidential personal servant. Thank you very much for this Kartik Yatra, which I—and all devotees—eagerly await every year as the most spiritually nourishing days of the entire year.\n \n You always emphasize in your lectures the quality of humility—trinād api sunīcena—to always give respect to others and not expect respect from others. Although this principle seems very easy, it is actually the most difficult to practice in spiritual life. I personally tend to expect some appreciation from seniors for my service, or respect from juniors. Thank you very much for giving strong devotees like Radheshyam Prabhu and Gaurang Prabhu. Specifically, in my spiritual life, HG Radheshyam Prabhu’s contribution has been very important, along with the valuable guidance of my immediate superiors and counselors.\n \n Although my reading abilities may be limited, I am trying my best to read Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books daily. I beg you to kindly shower your blessings upon me so that I may develop even a small tinge of humility and genuine love for Krishna. I deeply appreciate your compassion and your dedication to following HDG Śrīla Prabhupāda’s instructions.\n \n Under the guidance of senior devotees, I am dedicating my time to Krishna consciousness. I humbly seek your mercy to follow your teachings faithfully and to share your words with others. Please bless me with steady progress in my sādhana and services, and protect me from anarthas. I pray to Śrī Śrī Rādhā Kunjabihari for your good health. Hare Krishna!!\n Your insignificant but fortunate servant,\n Nitai Karunda Das"

We feel immensely blessed to have the opportunity to express our gratitude through this humble offering. Deep within our hearts, we know that no words can ever fully convey our love for you, nor can we ever adequately thank you for the invaluable presence and guidance you have bestowed upon our lives.\n \n One of the most important steps in advancing on the path of bhakti is spiritual nourishment, which we experience when we feel loved, cared for, and protected within the Vaiṣṇava community. In your example, we clearly see how gracefully you embody these qualities and how sincerely you have cultivated them across all the communities, mentors, counsellors, and leaders under your guidance.\n \n We also see in your personal dealings how deeply conscious you are of everyone’s comfort, especially that of your Godbrothers and Godsisters. You never accept anything for yourself until you are sure that everyone else is cared for and comfortable. When the Vrajavāsīs visited the Chowpatty temple, you ensured they received the same facilities and care that they are accustomed to in Vraja-dhāma, making their stay as warm, respectful, and comfortable as possible. All of this truly reflects how central and meaningful devotee care is to you.\n \n Recently, we heard an incident that revealed the depth of your love and devotion for Śrīla Prabhupāda. Although you had very limited personal association with him, your heartfelt desire to serve him directly was always strong. When Śrīla Prabhupāda was about to depart from this world, he sent a message to all his disciples worldwide, requesting them to come and be with him in his final days. At that time, you were serving in New Vrindavan. Unfortunately, the authorities there chose not to announce this message to the community, thinking that if all devotees left, the services would remain unattended. As a result, you received the news only a few days after Śrīla Prabhupāda had already departed.\n \n What touched our hearts most was that, although you could not physically be present, Śrīla Prabhupāda personally came to you in your dreams every night. In those dreams, you were able to serve him—massaging him, cooking for him, and offering your sincere devotion directly. This deeply moving incident shows how strong your connection with Śrīla Prabhupāda truly is, and how he reciprocates your unwavering dedication and love.\n \n Another touching incident comes from the Brooklyn temple, where a young woman from a devotee family once approached you with a heartfelt question. She asked why you had never left ISKCON despite the many challenges and difficulties the society has faced over the years. She had endured a troubled childhood due to certain issues within the Vaiṣṇava community, which had caused her to distance herself from ISKCON.\n \n With great compassion, you shared Śrīla Prabhupāda’s profound words—that ISKCON is his body. And even when a body is wounded, bleeding, or unwell, it is the duty of a loving child to care for it even more, not to abandon it. You then gently explained, “How could I ever leave ISKCON when this is the body of my spiritual master?” Your answer touched her deeply. The young woman, who had once stepped away from ISKCON, was moved to tears by your sincerity and conviction. Your words not only gave her healing but also rekindled her faith and connection to the movement.\n \n You have always emphasised quality over quantity, and your vision has deeply inspired us. We were especially moved when we heard you say, “People are to be loved, and projects are to be used for the upliftment of the community — not the other way around.” Your words beautifully capture the essence of true leadership and remind us that genuine spiritual communities are built upon care, compassion, and personal relationships.\n \n As HG Vrajabhīṣī Prabhu has beautifully highlighted in one of his lectures, your four most important qualities are:\n 1. Live without pretending — embodying honesty\n 2. Hear without defending — exemplifying humility\n 3. Speak without offending — showing sensitivity\n 4. Love without expecting — demonstrating selflessness\n \n We sincerely strive to imbibe these qualities in our own lives, inspired by your example, and to reflect even a fraction of the compassion, wisdom, and devotion that you so effortlessly embody. On this auspicious day we sincerely pray for your good health and continued association.\n \n In this beautiful lotus of the Vyāsa-pūjā book, adorned with so many fragrant and glorious petals, we humbly pray that you will accept this tiny petal of love and devotion from us—your most insignificant children. May it reach your lotus feet as a token of our gratitude, reverence, and deep affection.\n \n Your most insignificant fallen children\n Nitai Prana Das\n Taruni Gopika DD\n Shaunak and Kalindi\n London - UK"

Your way of explaining the lila is so mesmerizing, as if we have entered the lila.\n You have given us HG Naam Prem Prabhu, under whom we are getting trained.

I specially appreciate your counseling system, through which we are getting guidance according to your mood.\n \n You are an example of *tṛṇād api su-nīcena*. This is the only way to continue lifelong in Krishna Consciousness. You have such a loving relationship with your Godbrother.\n \n I have joined this year as PDC Yellow Brigade.

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Mahārāj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to You and Gaurāṅga. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n \n On this most auspicious day of Your 75th Appearance, I feel deeply fortunate and grateful to have received this opportunity to express even a drop of appreciation for Your boundless compassion, love, and care.\n \n During the recent Kārtik Yātrā, I witnessed Your care in a way that touched me profoundly. You envisioned and arranged every detail with such thoughtfulness that every devotee — young, elderly, or physically challenged — felt personally embraced by Your affection. The separate prasādam arrangement for senior devotees, where they could sit peacefully without any anxiety, reflected the compassionate heart with which You lead us. I could see how much ease and dignity it brought to them, and it reminded me that real spirituality expresses itself through practical, heartfelt compassion.\n \n The care You arranged for the children was equally heart-warming. The dedicated play-area brought them so much joy, allowing them to feel at home in a spiritual environment. It also allowed their parents to hear Your nectarean kathā peacefully, without worry.\n \n Your compassion extended even into the realm of health and well-being. The medical seva arranged under Your guidance was a blessing for many of us. I personally experienced its value during my leg injury. The timely attention, the gentle care, and the genuine concern shown by devotees brought me so much relief. I also witnessed devotees with serious health conditions receiving whatever care and treatment they needed from doctor-devotees. That entire arrangement radiated Your spirit — where every devotee’s pain is Your pain, and every devotee’s comfort is Your comfort.\n \n One of the most wondrous moments of the Yātrā was the complete absence of rain, even though it was expected. It felt as though Girirāja Himself was sheltering us because of Your divine presence. It allowed all of us to experience the Govardhan pastime in a way that felt divinely orchestrated. Walking under the clear skies, hearing the sweet kīrtans, and seeing thousands of devotees moving together in harmony felt like a miracle You personally gifted us. It was only because of Your mercy that I could witness the beauty and sweetness of that sacred pastime right there in Govardhan.\n \n Throughout the entire Yātrā, You held us together like a loving father — guiding, protecting, and inspiring us at every moment. Your presence softened every hardship and transformed every moment into a spiritual treasure. The way You personally observed every detail made each one of us feel valued, cared for, and deeply sheltered.\n \n Mahārāj, today I offer something from my heart. I humbly beg for Your blessings to help me remain steady in the vows I took at my initiation on December 27th at Govardhan Eco-Village. Please give me the strength and sincerity to live those vows — not mechanically, but lovingly, with full surrender to Your instructions. May I always remember that initiation was not just a ceremony — it was a lifelong commitment to Your lotus feet, a promise to shape my life according to Your teachings.\n \n Please bless me so that I may follow Your instructions wholeheartedly, without compromise, without hesitation, and without laziness.\n tṛṇād api sunīcena,\n taror iva sahiṣṇunā,\n amāninā mānadena,\n kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.\n May I cultivate humility, tolerance, and respect for all — just as You exemplify every moment. May these qualities become the foundation of my service, my chanting, and my relationships. May I become an instrument in Your mission, serving You with gratitude, sincerity, and devotion.\n \n Guru Mahārāj, whatever spiritual progress I have made is only because of Your mercy. Whatever I may become in the future will also be by Your grace alone. On this sacred day of Your Appearance, I pray to remain forever under the shelter of Your lotus feet.\n \n All glories to You, dear Guru Mahārāj.\n All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n Yas, Nityanand Priya Das"

Happy 75th Appearance Day Maharaj!\n\nI have completed one year in the ISKCON family and wish to continue my journey with your due blessings. This year has been a tough yet mesmerizing year in the company of Vaishnavas. Though I have not yet been successful in convincing my family of the sweet nectar of spirituality and Shri Krishna bhakti, I often lie at home and attend satsang at Vashi and visit Chowpatty temple with my dear friend, who also happens to be a part of ISKCON for many years. Though I haven\u0027t seen or met you in person, I have been immensely blessed and loved by your followers. Your glories are regularly reflected by the love and treatment I receive from the matajis. Pujya Radhika Mataji and Madri Mataji here at Mumbai love me immensely and treat me as their own. Their love and affection bring tears to my eyes. I have been unable to express how blessed I feel every time I meet them. Both of them always entertain my nonsense questions and embrace my silly behavior with open hands. They have always told me that the love and affection I receive has been the reason for your teachings and blessings. The matajis here have always glorified you so much through their actions that I have been lost for words. Each and every person who loves you has been glorifying you through his/her love, actions, and words. Your followers are a magnificent reflection of you. Today, Chowpatty temple has been the place where I am at peace. Though I have visited it only four times, I immensely miss it every day. I have been desperately willing to do sewa at the temple ever since. And this is all because of your efforts that the beauty of the temple doesn\u0027t only leave the visitors in awe but also at peace. I hope my struggles convincing my parents end someday, and we together as a family can be a part of ISKCON. Last year, I had written to you for the first time on the same occasion by only listening about you from my very friend at ISKCON. I have been told that you read each and every letter written to you. Hope this offering of mine also comes across you, and if possible, please bless me to grow in Shri Krishna bhakti. Honestly, I am not a disciplined and sincere girl. I haven\u0027t been able to carry out my life roles in my various relationships as expected. I have been always mentally and emotionally unstable all my life, not able to figure out my goals and purpose of life. My failures and confusions are making me lazy day by day. I have lost my desire to do anything in life. I am always in a confusion if I am walking the right path.\n\nI know this offering was meant to glorify you, but I wish to offer my list of drawbacks and faults within me. I only wish to seek shelter at the holy feet of that Guru Maharaj whose followers have constantly been an ocean of love and kindness, generosity, and forgiveness to me. I thereby request you to please bless me as well so that I become a better human being and be of some use to you and the Almighty. Thank you for all the teachings, love, affection, kindness I received through your followers. Hare Krishna Guru Maharaj. Keep smiling.\n\nYour eternal servant,\nNupur Lad."

Beyond any doubt, as you always pray, guard, and inquire, Srila Prabhupada\u0027s movement is in safe hands and will go on for the next 10,000 years at least.\n\nI am a struggling sadhaka with so many anarthas, but under the guidance of your instructions and the push by the local devotees, slowly but surely, I am hopeful to be able to please you in some lifetime.\n\nAt the same time, there are many things which I come across, either as an observer or party, addressing which could make our ISKCON even better. This is where my biggest dilemma lies. Personally, I have to focus on my sadhana, but collectively also, we need to do something, as Srila Prabhupada indicated by \"Organization and Intelligence\" having \u0027built a house in which the entire world can live\u0027, and co-operating with His divine \u0027body\u0027.\n\nYour emphasis on \"People over Projects\" on one hand, and HDG BSST quote \"Management is a necessary evil\" is killing me. I am unable to balance the two with my limited and inadequate efforts. Your mercy is the only shelter and hope. Please somehow or the other, remove this problem and let me act in such a way that I can always remember Krishna, Srila Prabhupada, You, and all the wonderful devotees and never forget Him/them.\n\nYour 75th Appearance Day is truly a memorable occasion, and I am so fortunate to be living in this period. Yet, I shudder at the thought of how the world would be 75 years hence with more than 4 lakh years of Kali Yuga still remaining. Please make me an insignificant servant in this most glorious movement, so that I can help as many devotees as possible in their efforts of reclaiming the fallen souls.\n\nAspiring to be an insignificant servant in the hands of a servant of your servant,\nPaavan Nitai das"

Gurudev, the love you have for Srila Prabhupada is so deep that you remember him and his instructions and are trying to serve in this modern, advanced world, accommodating the living entities as per their comforts and likings, and seeing to it that by preaching in different ways, you do not deviate from Krishna consciousness and disobey Srila Prabhupada\u0027s instructions. The projects that you have started, the thoughts that you have implemented, and the preaching that you have done is different and unique and transforming many souls. You have given independence to your disciples to preach as per the need of the hour, and this is exactly how Srila Prabhupada did, different from other disciples of Bhakti Siddhant Saraswati Thakur Maharaj, and brought a revolution throughout the world, as he always felt that whatever he has achieved was empowered by his Guru and gave the credit to his Gurumaharaj. By doing things differently, you faced challenges and disagreements, but you had faith in Srila Prabhupada\u0027s instructions, and thus by not deviating from that, you achieved success in all of your services. And this is how all of your brahmachari and grihasta disciples are preaching by their wisdom and acharan, following your instructions, and are successful too. It\u0027s amazing to see 10,000+ devotees coming together in yatra, serving, chanting, and cooperating just to please your holiness, the same way as you want to please Srila Prabhupada.\n Dear Gurudev, I always feel you are with me, watching me, correcting me, showing the right path to me, guiding, loving, caring, protecting me, and always showering your causeless mercy and blessings unto me. You know exactly when to inspire me, when to humble me, like a mother does to her child for his growth. By your divine vani, association, and by associating with your senior disciples, we learn a lot about your mood and your instructions that you have spoken to them. They share those with us at the right hour of need, which makes me feel how much you love me and care for my inner transformation of heart.\n Today, for my own purification, I beg at your lotus feet that may I develop a deeper connection with you by being a good disciple of yours, following your instructions, and serving and respecting devotees without ulterior motives and care for the ones who trust me in this journey of Krishna consciousness.\n I always admire the loving exchanges you have with your godbrothers and godsisters; so much to learn, digest, and most importantly, apply in this lifetime practically.\n \n Thank you, Gurudev, for everything that you have given me, though I am not at all qualified.\n \n Your most insignificant servant\n Padma Kishori devi dasi"

We consider ourselves fortunate to live in this era.\n \n This year, Govardhan yatra was a reality experience of Giriraj in shabdha bhraman.\n \n Maharajji, seeing your selfless nature to spread the glory of the holy name, we also beg for your blessings to be part of your mission to spread the glory of the holy name to young minds.\n \n Without your mercy, Shri Shri Radha Gopinathji and the whole Guru Parampara will not empower us.\n \n Maharajji, we beg for pushti for all our spiritual endeavors.\n \n \n We remain your eternal servants,\n \n PadmaGopika Devi Dasi\n Parth Krishna Dasa\n Bhadragopi Devi Dasi\n Ujjvala Rasa Dasa\n Radharaman"

By your personal example, you teach us how a true Vaiṣṇava gives all credit to the Supreme Lord. This humility makes you a shining inspiration for countless devotees across the world.\n \n Just as the Supreme Lord descends in specific incarnations to fulfill His divine mission, similarly, His pure devotees appear in this world to accomplish a particular purpose on His behalf.

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my most humble, prostrated obeisances unto your lotus feet.\n \n It is our great fortune to witness your 75th birthday. From the time we met you first, you have been the same changeless personality, encompassing great humility, tolerance, respect to others, and absorption in Krishna consciousness. It is difficult to find even a single small event of any deviation from true Vaishnava behavior. By your personal example, you have shown modern and often impatient devotees how a genuine Vaishnava lives and behaves.\n \n I feel grateful that such an illustrious example exists in the present time. You show how Bhakti can be lived with balance, intelligence, emotional maturity, respect, inner depth, and steady dedication to the holy name and the mission of Srila Prabhupāda. Your life teaches me that true greatness does not need any display. It shines quietly through your character, your conduct, and your consistency.\n \n You are very different from guru personalities who depend on scholarship, complex philosophy, or impressive spiritual presentations. Your strength does not come from dramatic stories or usage of esoteric language or higher realization stuff. It comes from the quiet purity of your heart. You carry a heart of gold—simple, compassionate, respectful, and sincerely dedicated to serving others without any desire to show yourself.\n \n What I admire most is that your devotional life stands firmly on the essentials: deep attachment to the dhāma, sincere respect for the holy name, heartfelt honor for Srila Prabhupāda and especially his disciples, and genuine affection for the simple Brajvasis. Their natural devotion matches your inner nature. Your connection with them is not external. It is deep, personal, and full of affection.\n \n One quality of yours that inspires me again and again is the way you give complete attention to anyone who comes before you. Whether it is a senior devotee or a new Vaishnava, you give the same calm and full presence. Even a short moment with you makes a person feel valued and respected. There is no hurry, no distraction, and always full presence of mind and heart.\n \n Your eagerness to improve your service, refine your interactions, and deepen your sincerity is adorable and amazing. You do not present yourself as someone with extraordinary access. Your preference for honest, grounded Bhakti over philosophical show makes you easy to trust and relate with.\n \n When I watch you, I understand that real devotion does not need to look extraordinary. It only needs to be true. In your presence, I feel that Bhakti is not something to perform. It is something to live—quietly, sincerely, and every day. Your example reminds me that true greatness hides itself in simplicity, service, steadiness, and a deep connection to the holy name.\n There are some recent interactions with you where I have experienced the greatness of your good self:\n A During the construction of New Hospital in Barsana, your good self visited when the structure was complete and internal works were pending. There was a delay in the timeline for completion of the project. When you arrived, you wanted to use the washroom, and I took you to a temporary setup. Feeling responsible, I said, “Maharaj, I am sorry the project is delayed and not completed on time.”\n Your reply was spontaneous and a few words only, and that pierced my heart. You said, “I see more than the timeline whether bhakti is growing or not.” I became speechless. In that moment, I understood what you wanted me to focus on, beyond deadlines and external achievements.\n \n B Last year, I was in a very introspective and remorseful state. Sachinandan Prabhu had unexpectedly left all of us in August 2024. He was my partner during my early preaching days in Nashik. His sudden departure left me sad and withdrawn. I often reflected on our early days together and wondered how my leaving Nashik had affected so many devotees. Every day I was simply expressing my feelings to you in my heart.\n \n In October 2024, by your mercy, you visited Nashik after a long time. I also happened to be in Nashik and was invited to a private gathering of devotees. I sat quietly in a corner. When you entered and sat on the vyāsāsana, one devotee pulled me closer.\n As soon as you saw me, you smiled brightly and said, “Welcome home.”\n Those words melted my heart. They carried acceptance, affection, and genuine happiness. When you later asked me to speak, I became unusually emotional in front of the devotees. That moment healed me deeply. I felt your love and care in a very real way.\n \n C Soon after Nashik, in the same month, I again had the opportunity to meet you at GEV. You met the CEO of Vaidyaratnam and his wife. I was there with my wife, Haripriya Gopi Devi. You were relaxed, happy, and fully available that day.\n After their meeting, I gently asked if we could speak with you for a few minutes. You immediately agreed. You spent around 45 minutes listening to our difficulties, our challenges, and our concerns. During this meeting, we felt so much of your affection. You kept giving us gifts, four in total for our two daughters who were not present.\n When we came downstairs and waited for the cart, you came again, plucked two small flowers from the garden, and said they were for our daughters. As you walked ahead, you kept looking back at us with a warm smile. That moment was a complete mercy package. Even today, remembering that, we feel overwhelmed by your unconditional love and acceptance.\n \n All these experiences remain etched in our consciousness and keep reminding us of the true nature of a sadhu—full of genuine love and compassion.\n \n Dear Gurudev, we are very fallen and disoriented. We are still struggling to completely follow all instructions given by you, still preparing to surrender, and hope that one day we can genuinely follow the mood and example set by you in a small capacity. Our children also aspire to imbibe your mood and sincerely serve your instructions and your devotees.\n \n Your unworthy servants,\n Paramahamsa Das and Haripriya Gopi Devi Dasi."

We are fools and do not have proper words to glorify you. Yet, from the bottom of our hearts we want to thank you for giving us this treasure-house of bhakti. We cannot imagine our good fortune to receive your divine shelter after millions of births.\n • Your compassion connects us to Śrīla Prabhupāda and the glorious Brahma–Madhva–Gauḍīya Sampradāya.\n • Your lectures reveal our sambandha, abhidheya, and prayojana.\n • Your instructions keep us safe from Māyā.\n • Your kīrtans nourish our hearts with the Holy Name.\n • Your dhām–yātras reveal the eternal pastimes of the Lord.\n • Your projects give us the privileged opportunity to serve.\n • Your disciples guide us on the path of bhakti.\n • Your Journey Home shares with us countless jewels of wisdom.\n Sitting comfortably in our homes, we gain so much from what you gained only after undertaking an arduous, dangerous, courageous journey filled with life-threatening incidents into unknown lands, driven by a burning desire to understand the Lord. Practically at every step of The Journey Home, you share precious, deep realizations. What you are giving through your life and your Journey Home is truly priceless. You are an ocean of divine qualities, and we aspire for a few drops of it.\n One learning that you share through your interaction with Ghanshyam das Baba and Radha Gopijana Vallabha and is deeply reflected in your own life has deeply touched my heart. “You are Gopijana Vallabha’s friend, but I am only the servant of His servants. My only happiness in life is in serving devotees.” Please bless me that I always consider myself a simple, fallen servant of Gopīnātha, remember that everyone else is a friend of Gopīnātha, and humbly serve anyone and everyone who comes to Him.\n Whether you were an unknown so-called new brahmacārī, or a prominent sanyāsī, guru to thousands of disciples, inspiring lakhs of people around the world—your natural humility has never changed. You were happy caring for cows, serving the Deities, singing alone through the night in secluded places; and you are equally happy inspiring world leaders, guiding countless souls, and managing temples and projects solely to please Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n ________________________________________\n Today, on the most auspicious occasion of your Vyāsa Pūjā, Gurudev, we beg at your lotus feet that although we are totally unqualified, please keep us under the shelter of your lotus feet eternally, shower your mercy upon us and allow us to render some service unto you, to the best of our capacity, in the humble mood of the servant of the servant.\n We also pray at the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā Gopīnāthjī to bless you with a long and healthy life so you may continue to inspire more and more souls to take shelter of Śrīla Prabhupāda and perfect their lives in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n ________________________________________\n Your insignificant servants,\n Parikshit Dās, Sakhi Sundarī Devī Dāsī \u0026 Viśākhā"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Dear Maharaj,\nPlease Accept My Humble Obeisances\n\nIn this offering I want to mention the things/incidents which have really inspired me in my Krishna Consciousness journey and have deeply touched my heart.\n\nFirst is the section about Vrindavan in your book The Journey Home, especially the story of Ghanshyam Das Babaji Maharaj.\n\nSecond, your Gaur Lila lectures from ISKCON Desire Tree which I heard when I was very new to ISKCON. They gave me faith in the process and in Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nThird, the amazing community of devotees that you have given us. With your love, you have empowered so many devotees to become great leaders and preachers who are doing wonderful services within ISKCON.\n\nFourth, I was amazed and so blissful when I visited GEV. It’s a manifestation of your heart, which is Vrindavan.\n\nFifth, the Kartik Yatra, it really fuels me with so much inspiration and Krishna Conscious memories, that I am able to enthusiastically go on for the entire next year. Everything is amazing there, your lectures, the association of so many devotees, wonderful services and dhaam darshans. It’s a condensed package of bliss.\n\nSixth, I once saw one video in which you were offering obeisances to HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj on meeting him and Maharaj was trying to offer obeisances back. Your genuine humility always reflects in your dealings. Wherever you go, whenever you reach there, like when you come to Kolkata I saw you offer obeisance to all devotees even when they are so much junior to you. It sometimes breaks my heart. But you Maharaj, as an Acharya, teach us, by your example, how to always be in a humble mood.\n\nIn this same regard, I saw when you had come to Kolkata in 2016 in Jaladuta Yatra festival, when we were celebrating 50 years of Srila Prabhupada’s leaving for the west. In the event, there were sofas arranged for GBCs, Sanyasis and Senior Srila Prabhupada’s disciples. All other devotees were sitting on mats on the floor. I saw when you came to attend the program, for you, sofas were arranged, but you after reaching, simply sat on the floor, with all other devotees, and attended the whole program just like that. I was very touched by that Maharaj.\n\nOn your 75th Vyasa Puja, I pray for your blessings to be able to sincerely, seriously and strictly follow your instructions, and to be able to serve my authorities, who are your senior disciples, lifelong with commitment and dedication, so that I am able to assist them in fulfilling your desires which are to fulfill the desires of Srila Prabhupada’s.\n\nPlease bless all devotees in Kolkata that we are able to make a very gorgeous temple here to glorify Srila Prabhupada in His birthplace, as gorgeous as Srila Prabhupada wanted, the same which is also your heart’s desire.\n\nPlease forgive me for all my offenses at your lotus feet and at the lotus feet of any of your disciples.\n\nAspiring to be your insignificant servant,\nParth"

        "Your Offering ":  "Around 3 years back when I watched a video The Song of Gratitude - HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj on YouTube, maybe some 30+ times. All that I felt was: \"See how heroic Guru Maharaj is in this video!\" I really felt that, and that\u0027s why I played it many times to see his smile, his walk, his speech again and again. Everything is so beautiful.\n\nBut after I started hearing the lectures of Guru Maharaj, and aspiring from him, while watching the same video after a long gap, I don\u0027t know. Tears were rolling in my eyes. I cried by the middle of the video. I was not even able to hold it at one point. After trying hard for 10+ seconds, I stopped the video, wiping my tears.\n\nAnd what I felt was that, \"I am so much unqualified, still foolishly aspiring from Maharaj.\" And remembering how I have so many times compromised in tough mentally times, without sticking to the promises and principles. I felt sorry, sorry Maharaj, I am so sorry. I am not worthy.\n\nI am very much clear that I know myself very well. It doesn\u0027t take me more than 5 minutes to slip into a deep drowsy state while hearing lectures. Even one year is not enough for me to complete a small book 50-100 pages. 16 rounds will be done – late at night or sometimes the next day. Not even 12 Mangala Aratis a year.\n\nIt is only your greatness, Maharaj, through the mercy of devotees, that I am able to improve in my sadhana standards, like chanting early in the morning, developing taste in lectures, attending Mangala Aratis frequently. Maharaj\u0027s lectures are an oasis; they rejuvenate me whenever I take Maharaj\u0027s association.\n\nI beg for your forgiveness and mercy, Maharaj, for all my negligence. Kindly accept this poor soul. I would like to remain in the association of devotees, serving the Lordships and devotees, balancing my family responsibilities. Please bless me in developing loving relationships with devotees and servitude, Maharaj.\n\nWishing you a shubha Krishna conscious birthday, Maharaj.\nYour insignificant servant"

It is not something you teach just through your words—it is something you live every moment.\n \n I remember a simple yet unforgettable moment:\n I was standing alone in a corridor, and as you walked past, you paused for a second, looked at me gently, and nodded. That tiny gesture has stayed with me for life.\n \n Another incident that left a deep impression on me was during a lift ride. I and some devotees were carrying a lot of boxes. When you came, any person of your position would expect the lift to be cleared for them. But without even a second’s thought, you quietly took the stairs, simply to not inconvenience us.\n \n This single action taught more about humility than a thousand lectures could.\n \n I have also seen how, during Kartik Yatra, you express such genuine gratitude to the devotees doing background services—cooking, managing, arranging, cleaning, organizing. Even the smallest service, you glorify as if it is the greatest achievement. This has taught me to value every devotee, every task, every sacrifice. You make service feel sacred.\n \n Your devotee care is another quality that has inspired me. The way you strive for others, the way you acknowledge each devotee’s issues, the way you shower your love—this is the kind of compassion I want to cultivate in my own life.\n \n I pray for the strength to follow your teachings and to imbibe even a drop of your qualities.\n I pray for the courage to adopt a servant-leader attitude like yours, in my work, my responsibilities, and my relationships.\n I pray that I may always remain connected to the Vaishnavas and continue growing under the shelter of sincere devotees who follow your footsteps.\n \n Thank you, Maharaj, for giving the world an example of how soft the heart of a true saint is.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Ashutosh"

        "Your Offering ":  "Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet, Srila Guru Maharaja. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n When I heard you say once, \"All glories to Guru and Gauranga means nothing left for us, no glory for ourselves,\" I was very moved. That goal is a spiritual setpoint, a mark to achieve a particular level of humility. But often, when agitated, I am unable to remember this and many teachings of yours, being a conditioned soul. Last year, my exams went fine by your grace, but I was battered throughout the year. Many anarthas loomed over me again and again, pulling me down like a screeching demon. Only your grace and the gift of Bhakti kept me going. When I was tired, fallen, struggling with my sobriety attempts, your statement, \"There is no disqualification for Bhakti,\" reminded me that no matter how fallen I may be, no matter how far down the wrong road I have gone, there is still hope to return. I have not been disqualified.\n \n This year, on Srila Prabhupada\u0027s appearance day, I heard for the first time the beautiful song offering \"Je subh diner aradhana.\" It was so heartfelt, and my heart melted on the line \"jeevan yuddhe parajita.\" Because that\u0027s true. I am utterly defeated in my fight of life, but by your mercy, grace, and remembrance, I can get back up, dust my armor, and wage battle yet again.\n \n By your grace, Guru Maharaja, I was able to secure a boundary rank. I was not adept in my studies and therefore could not get a better rank. Still, I look forward to getting an MS Surgery seat by your grace. That life is going to be more busy, more hard, and more challenging. But it is also going to be one with more service opportunities. Please bless me, Maharaja, so that I may continue steadfast on this path of surrender and continue being strong in my vows to you.\n \n Guru Maharaja, I do not want to ask any questions in this offering of mine. Your Vyasa Puja is a day of celebration, and I don\u0027t want to bother you, Maharaja, with my questions. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll enlighten me about those questions during my prayers and meditation. I\u0027m very happy, Maharaja, that I found your shelter. I want to make you happy. And I think nothing can make you happier than me serving devotees.\n \n Therefore, I have started working on a monthly magazine. So far, I have published three issues on Scribd, by the name \"This War of Mine.\" I\u0027ve also put it on Telegram: https://t.me/twomagazine. First, I used to put my own thoughts and articles in it, but by your mercy, I understood that\u0027s a flawed practice. From editions two and onwards, I have started putting articles that I\u0027ve heard or read from other senior devotees. This way, my pride remains in check, and I get to serve the devotees. I\u0027ve also taken up the work of dubbing the eleven DVDs of \"Following Prabhupada\" in Hindi language and then uploading them on YouTube. So far, I\u0027ve translated and rendered about 1.5 hours of the first DVD. It is an added pleasure to serve patients who show up in my hospital, where I\u0027m posted.\n \n I look forward to serving you, Maharaja, for all my life and beyond. Please always keep me under the shelter of your lotus feet. I also look forward to the acceptance of my candidature as a Harinam Diksha applicant in your shelter. Please formally initiate me whenever you think I am ready for it. I will always be standing in your service, ready for any instruction you give me. Please bless me, Maharaja.\n \n Pranam, Maharaja.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada."

        "Your Offering ":  "tṛṇād api sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā\namāninā mānadena kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ\n\nThis verse from Siksastakam truly defines the real characteristics of our beloved Guru Maharaj – HH Radhanath Swami. He is the living encyclopedia of sastras – the personified ‘Vyakti Bhagavatam’. Still, he is as humble as a blade of grass on the street which does not want any recognition. Guru Maharaj is a true role model when it comes to humility, and he wants his disciples and followers to keep the humble attitude no matter how elevated he or she becomes in practicing Krishna Consciousness principles.\n\nOur Guru Maharaj is transcendental to the three modes of material nature, beyond the bodily concept of life. Therefore, he remains equipoised amidst the dualities of life: happiness \u0026 distress, heat \u0026 cold, profit \u0026 loss, honor \u0026 dishonor, etc. He is as tolerant as a tree and preaches the same tolerant attitude to his disciples and followers.\n\nOur beloved Guru Maharaj is ready to offer all respects to others and expects none for himself. He is a true Vaisnava who considers any respect offered to him as a hot potato and does not keep the same to himself. He passes on all the respects to Srila Prabhupada and previous acharyas and ultimately the same reaches to Lord Sri Krishna, Who being the absolute truth, can handle the same very easily.\n\nOnce someone asked the Guru Maharaj why he does not carry any deities with himself like other ISKCON sanyasis. Guru Maharaj replied very nicely, “The holy name is my deity”. Since Krishna’s name and His forms are non-different, Guru Maharaj carries the holy names of Lord Sri Krishna in his heart and chants the Lord’s names constantly wherever he goes. The Lord Sri Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita verse 9.14:\n\nsatataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ\nnamasyantaś ca māṁ bhaktyā nitya-yuktā upāsate\n\n“Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.” Our Guru Maharaj, a great soul, is a true personification of this verse of Bhagavad Gita. I offer my humble obeisances on the lotus feet of our beloved Guru Maharaj. JAI GURUDEV!"

I submit my humble prayers to Srila Prabhupada and Srimati Radha Rani to bless us with your association for many many years to come. I pray to Lord Narasimhadev to give you health and vitality. Though an insignificant servant, I promise to give my best efforts to keep my vows, chant sincerely, and serve with dedication. I am not qualified to glorify you, Maharaja ji, but please accept my unworthy attempt.\n \n Guru Maharaja ji, this year I had the opportunity to hear you in person at the Goverdhan Yatra. It was a dream come true for me; it being a rare opportunity. It was heartwarming to associate with the wonderful Vaishnavas of the congregation. There was a lot to learn about devotee care from the very thoughtful management of the yatra.\n When you were doing katha, Maharaja ji, I felt you were speaking to me personally. In fact, I felt that the Guru Parampara was speaking through you. When you were singing kirtans, I felt transported to the spiritual world! And on the last day, we followed you to the car, imbibing your radiance and repossessing your aura till the time we can see you again!\n Guru Maharaja ji, one moment that will always stay with me is the one when you spoke about Srila Prabhupada leaving his body. Please bless me that I can feel one fraction of the love you feel for your Guru Maharaja and the dedication with which you serve him. Such esoteric topics elude me, as I am a fallen soul incapable of fine spiritual emotions.\n \n I feel gratitude for Your Holiness, who has shown us the standards of spiritual service. By your lectures and writings, you inspire and instruct us on how to integrate life in this world with an ambition for a spiritual one. Your deep insights inspire us to look beyond the mundane and treat every living being as a part and parcel of Krishna. Your high standards of sadachara show us the way to ideal devotee relationships.\n \n Guru Maharaja ji, I am trying to serve at our local temple, ISKCON Faridabad, but with your blessings, I can do better. We have a wonderful congregation, and I am extremely happy to serve here!\n I am serving the ISKCON Girls Forum, trying to guide the Vaishnavis to adopt a spiritual way of life.\n I am also participating in the EVOLVE Ujjwal Bhavishya—a Vedic Olympiad Program in which we approach schools to conduct this contest based on Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books. We also conduct online/offline classes for them. Every year, thousands of children/households receive Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books last year, about 30,000. I am grateful for my mentors for engaging me in this service.\n I also try to coordinate cultural programs on the festivals, and I am happy to say that the IGF is participating very enthusiastically.\n Now is the time for Gita Marathon, and we are starting with blessings from our senior Vaishnavas. I seek your blessings so that I can overcome my limitations and distribute many, many books for the pleasure of our beloved Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Guru Maharaja ji, I try to capture the spirit of your writings by composing poems. This one is inspired by your book, THE JOURNEY WITHIN. I humbly dedicate this to you. Thank you for your profound insights.\n \n The Caterpillar Metamorphosis\n \n Creeping and crawling from branch to branch\n Feeding voraciously on the leafy greens\n The caterpillar lives a greedy life\n Munching and chewing from dawn to night\n \n Moving surreptitiously with his multifarious limbs\n “I am the lord of all I survey,” he thinks\n He devours all there is in sight\n Ne’er pausing to see the light\n \n Then one day, he beholds a butterfly\n And wonders what it’s like to have wings and fly\n With some remorse, he retrospects his gluttonous life\n Full of will-o\u0027-the-wisp joy and endless strife\n \n Now he deems he has had too much\n Pleasures and pains of the world galore\n “Is this what I am meant to do?\n Eat, excrete, and cry for more!”\n \n “What, indeed, will set me free?\n What am I really meant to be?”\n He begins to see how futile\n Is the Ferris wheel he’s been riding for a while\n \n He stays, he rests, he retracts his limbs\n He suspends his game and then pupates\n He builds a wall between him and ‘the world’\n He now sees his sins; he contemplates\n \n Edged on by the vision of the liberated one\n Seeking to overhaul himself to the core\n Flaw by flaw, he does his bit\n But then he waits for the divine to restore\n \n He lays himself bare with all his faults\n To the scalpel of exacting reformation\n He submits to the ways of his guiding star\n And patiently awaits merciful transformation\n \n And one day, as the sun returns\n A crack appears in his rusted cocoon\n An eternal creature of beauty and bliss\n Opens his eyes to the timeless moon!\n \n Dear Guru Maharaja ji, I seek your shelter. Please give me strength so that I can be without any personal agenda or aspirations and work only for ISKCON and Srila Prabhupada, like your good self.\n Please bless me so that I can be without desire for respect but can respect all living entities.\n Please empower me to overcome my anarthas and aparadhas so that I can chant the Holy Names and hear them!\n Please bless all of us who are together trying to walk the spiritual path, and those who have not yet found it within themselves to do so.\n \n Thank you, Guru Maharaja, for being there for us. I really wish we can meet you in person and take instructions from you. Please accept me as your most unworthy disciple.\n \n Trying to be a humble servant of the Vaishnavas\n \n Pragati Singla\n ISKCON Faridabad"

I beg for your blessings to become an instrument of your compassion and to always remain under your loving shelter.\n \n Guru Maharaj, I am very fallen in all aspects, but I have the deepest faith that only your mercy can heal me and encourage me to work upon my shortcomings.\n \n I humbly pray always to remain sheltered unto your lotus feet, Vaishnavas, and Srila Prabhupada.\n Your insignificant aspiring servant,\n Pragya Yadav"

Even though I am full of shortcomings, you still allow me to stand in your shelter, and that itself feels like the greatest mercy.\n \n By your blessings, I have tried to take steps toward personal growth — in my spiritual life, relationships, career, and inner transformation. I want to share my journey at your lotus feet with honesty:\n \n 1. My personal progress\n Although small, I feel I have made efforts to refine myself. I am learning to take responsibility, to introspect more deeply, and to let go of habits that pull me away from Krishna. Your teachings constantly push me to become more sincere and more aligned with the values of humility, compassion, and service.\n \n 2. Searching for a life partner\n With your blessings, I am praying for a girl who is compatible, Krishna-conscious, and someone with whom I can build a peaceful, devotional family life. I am trying to keep this search pure, patient, and guided by wisdom rather than impulse. I pray that I may accept whatever Krishna arranges as His mercy.\n \n 3. My situation at work\n Currently, in my corporate role, I am on a Performance Improvement Plan. Instead of seeing this as a failure, I am trying to see it as Krishna’s way of reshaping me. I am learning hard lessons, improving my skills, and reforming my attitude. Maharaj, your teachings remind me to remain steady, responsible, and grateful even during difficulties. I only pray that I grow into a more disciplined and mature person.\n \n 4. My struggle in Krishna consciousness\n I struggle, Maharaj; with discipline, with consistency, with mind and senses, and with maintaining purity. There are days when I feel strong and connected, and there are days when I painfully fail. Yet, your words remind me that struggle itself can become a form of devotion when we continue to try, again and again. I pray that someday my efforts become pleasing to you.\n \n 5.

Without your mercy, I have no strength to change. With your mercy, even an unqualified soul like me can take steps toward Krishna.\n \n Thank you for being my guide, my inspiration, and my shelter.\n Please continue to hold my hand as I walk — slowly, imperfectly — toward Krishna.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Prahlad Sharan Das"

Sitting and chanting with you in the early mornings throughout the pandal programs was an experience of divine bliss that will remain etched in my heart forever.\n \n Maharaj, I have been struggling throughout my life—both materially and spiritually. Despite years of practice, I still find so many unwanted desires and impurities residing within my heart. I often feel discouraged, realizing how far I am from the standard of pure devotion. Yet, the scriptures and saints declare that by the blessings of the spiritual master, even a dumb man can speak eloquently, and a lame man can cross mountains. You have always demonstrated this truth through your own life—living up to the expectations of your Guru Maharaj and empowering countless souls to perform acts of devotion that are far beyond their natural capacity.\n \n Guru Maharaj, you have shown through your personal example how to endeavor practically in every sphere of life—spiritual and material—always keeping Krishna at the center. Your determination, steadiness, and compassion are a living inspiration. However, I must confess that my own determination is often weak. I struggle to maintain my material responsibilities and face many challenges even in attaining the minimum necessities to carry out my duties. At times, I feel tired and helpless, but remembering your tireless example rekindles my hope. It reminds me that through your mercy, even my faltering steps can be steadied, and even my weakest efforts can find meaning in Krishna’s service.\n \n Therefore, my only prayer is that you kindly shower your causeless mercy upon me and my family. Please help me remain steady in my sadhana, responsible in my duties, and sincere in my service to the devotees. May I always remember you, seek shelter at your lotus feet, and serve in a way that brings you some small happiness.\n \n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Pranav Gopal Das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Maharaj, dandavat pranam, please accept my humble obeisances.\n \n Firstly, a very happy Krishna conscious 75th birthday! My heartfelt and sincere prayers to Krishna that may you cross a century!\n \n Maharaj, I joined ISKCON when I was only 5 years old. By the mercy of His Divine Grace Abhay Charanarvinda Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupad, I developed a spiritual habit of reading books. Today I am 17 years old and I can surely say that by his mercy only I could complete one-time reading of Shrimad Bhagavad-gita, Shrimad-Bhagavatam, and Sri Chaitanya-charitamrita. When initially my knowledge started questioning Gaudiya philosophy, and as I was keenly interested to know more about Prabhupad, I started reading about his disciples as well. I am from ISKCON Ravet, and all brahmacharis here are disciples of Maharaj, so obviously the first book I chose was \"Truthart Pathik,\" the Marathi translation of \"Journey Home.\" It is Krishna\u0027s plan only that travelling so long to Bharat to find about God, he came till here through various experiences and difficulties. He faced nothing in front of mine. His search for self-realization has taught me to never complain about my life. Next, I read \"Antaricha Diva,\" the second book. This book also shared Maharaj\u0027s wisdom as a leader of ISKCON. This book enlightened me to wake up to my reality of being a soul and have some spiritual interest for my own benefit only. Since 2017, I have been attending Maharaj\u0027s Kartik Yatra. Listening to Maharaj is a God-gift. His verbal power can be seen that at this age also he can give lectures for long, long hours. Maharaj always tells devotees what we should learn from the pastimes of the Lord. The claps at the end of the lecture create such high vibration, it creates power. Ecstatic kirtan performed by Maharaj, how can I forget that? Enthusiasm and young spark, it\u0027s still alive in him. Who says he\u0027s old? Maharaj showered blessings upon my father this year on Sri Rama-chandra Vijaya Utsav and gave him the spiritual name: Vitthal Bihari Das. I still have goosebumps when I hear that voice. My sincere request to Maharaj that may his blessings reach upon me and my mother as well because we have accepted him as spiritual master in mind and heart already. Thank you so much Maharaj! Jay Prabhupad!"

Because of your mercy, HG Radheshyam Prabhuji, HG Kanai Thakur Prabhuji, HG Aashray Gopal Prabhuji and Satyajit Prabhu and so many other devotees, I got the association of devotees. Currently, I am staying at a home away from home, i.e., in Ramanreti Vaisnava **under ISKCON BCEC, Pune**. I am assisting my superiors in some little services along with my studies. In this 5th semester of engineering, my counselor HG Aashray Gopal Prabhuji told me to make hearing a habit. So, I am regularly hearing your lectures at least for 15 minutes daily. Without hearing from you, I do not go to sleep. It is only the mercy of Krishna and you that I got inspiration to hear from self-realized souls like you.\n I like your lectures so much, especially those in which you narrate pastimes of the Lord and those in which you talk about Vaishnava Sadachar. Recently, I am hearing your lecture entitled \"Attention to details.\" In that, you told us that attention to the details is the sign of love. Also, you talked about free will. Our progress or downfall is always dependent on how we utilize our free will at every moment. Also, the lecture on the topic \"The Disease of Envy\" was so powerful for devotees in practicing KC. I have observed that you always stress the topic of controlling the mind and overcoming Anarthas in our hearts. I heard from you that when any devotee goes for preaching to non-devotees, the entire guru parampara is with him for support. This is very exciting for me. Also, you told me that accepting anxiety for the service of Krishna is a good thing.\n Maharaj, your each and every sentence is like a bullet that pierces my heart to purify it. Thank you so much, Maharaj.\n Recently, I read \"The Journey Home.\" I was shocked by seeing your efforts and austerity for knowing Krishna. Anyone can be inspired by reading this adventurous journey. I got very powerful lessons from it. By reading your journey, I have got the conviction that You are Krishna\u0027s representative only. I pray to the Lord that may I hear from you regularly and always stay in the association of devotees.\n Your Aspiring Servant,\n Prasad"

It is always inspiring, motivating, and deeply transforming to hear from Maharaj.\n I am a native Hindi speaker, yet Maharaj ji’s English is so simple and soulful that I forget the difference between Hindi and English while listening to him. Maharaj ji’s autobiography, The Journey Home, is profoundly inspiring and evokes faith in Krishna Bhakti, which is already deeply embedded within our hearts.\n Maharaj ji’s journey from his home in the United States to Sri Vrindavan Dham dispels all doubts and deviations that often arise in the mind of a spiritual seeker. His great struggles on the path of Bhakti and his unshakable faith in the Lord, despite countless obstacles, are truly inspiring.\n Even in his childhood, while living in a materially affluent society, Maharaj ji was naturally inclined toward simplicity and deeply yearning for the search of the Supreme Lord. Though so many obstacles stood before him, Maharaj ji continued to follow only a ray of hope — a ray of reciprocation from Krishna — and in return for that divine reciprocation, he was ready to sacrifice everything material: his property, relationships, comforts, and attachments. He embraced whatever destiny Krishna chose for him.\n Maharaj ji’s great journey to India, his meetings with exalted souls such as Tut Wale Baba, Siddha Yogis, and many humble, loving saints like Kailash Baba, Ghanshyam Baba, and Ramesh Baba, ultimately led to his divine union with the ocean of mercy — His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada.\n This journey beautifully demonstrates that although there are innumerable spiritual paths and many great souls following them, the love of Vrindavan Dham, Shrimati Radharani, and the Brajvasis is truly unparalleled.\n This life is meant only to learn to follow in the footsteps of Param Pujya Radhanath Maharaj.\n ✨ Param Pujya Radhanath Maharaj ki Jai! ✨"

Gurudev, on this sacred occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja, my heart is overflowing with emotions that are difficult to express in words. Your divine life, your compassion, your humility, and the unconditional love you shower upon every soul inspire the deepest gratitude within me. Yet, with trembling words and a prayerful heart, I attempt to place my feelings before your lotus feet.\n\nMy spiritual journey truly began on the 5th of October 2024, the day when I first received your divine darshan at Govardhan Ecovillage. That blessed moment transformed something within me in a way I had never experienced before. Your serene presence, gentle glance, and the quiet strength of your love awakened an indescribable attraction in my heart. From that very moment, an earnest desire to one day be accepted as your disciple silently took root within me. That day marked not merely a meeting—but the birth of a new longing, a new direction, a new life.\n\nLast year, I received only a few sacred moments of your association. Even those brief interactions left a deep and lasting impact on my heart. But this year, by your causeless mercy and by the love of the devotees, I was blessed with the extraordinary fortune of spending seven full days in your divine company during the Kartik Govardhan Yatra 2025. Those seven days were not ordinary days; they were divine blessings that cleansed, nourished, and uplifted my soul. Your profound teachings, your heart-melting kirtans, your affectionate glances, and your boundless compassion created a transformation inside me that words cannot fully describe. Each moment in your presence felt like receiving new life. Your association dissolved confusions, quieted anxieties, and filled my heart with devotion and hope. In your presence, Gurudev, I realized that you are not only a teacher—you are the embodiment of pure love, humility, compassion, and Krishna consciousness. Your life itself is a scripture that guides, elevates, and purifies all who come in contact with you.\n\nIn preparation for your Vyas Puja, I took a heartfelt vow to read your sacred autobiography “The Journey Home” three times. Every page of this book reveals the depth of your devotion, the sincerity of your heart, the courage of your spiritual search, and the divine grace that protected and guided you. Reading it does not merely inspire me—it reshapes my inner world. It strengthens my longing to walk the sacred path you have shown, and it fills me with reverence for the journey you undertook for the sake of seeking God.\n\nMy time with you in Vrindavan also remains one of the most precious gifts of my life. Your presence there felt like a gentle breeze carrying the sweetness of Krishna’s eternal abode. The kirtans you led, filled with bhava and devotion; your narrations of divine pastimes; your compassion toward every devotee—all these experiences touched me so deeply that I felt my heart melting and transforming from within. Being in Vrindavan under your shelter felt like entering a sacred space where the soul remembers its true nature.\n\nGurudev, I confess that I am still immature in my spiritual practice. I have many shortcomings and weaknesses. Yet despite my imperfections, I approach your lotus feet with sincerity and a longing for shelter. It is not by my qualification, but only by your causeless mercy that I may someday become worthy of being accepted as your disciple. This is my deepest prayer—that I may serve you with sincerity, follow your teachings with humility, and dedicate my life to your mission. Please bless me with the strength to walk this path steadily, with devotion and gratitude in my heart.\n\nYour 75 years of divine life have brought guidance, love, and Krishna consciousness to thousands of souls around the world. I am one among those souls who has found direction, purpose, and meaning because of your mercy. Your presence is a lamp that illuminates countless lives, and I feel eternally grateful for the light you have brought into mine.\n\nOn this sacred day of your Vyas Puja, I pray from the core of my heart that your health remain strong, your life continue to shine with divine radiance, and your compassion flow forever upon all the souls seeking shelter at your lotus feet. Gurudev, may my life become an offering to your mission. May every breath of mine remember your kindness. And may I always remain your servant.\n\nYour aspiring servant, your aspiring disciple,\nPrathamesh Digambar Adhav"

I am really grateful and thank you so much for enlivening Kartik Yatra, year after year. This year\u0027s Sri Govardhan Dham yatra was really enriching for my dried spiritual life. I could meet many devotees and recollected lost memories from the past. I was very inspired to know that there was no special diet prasad cooking for you, Maharaj; You had the same prasad which all devotees were taking, so that you could personally know the quality and taste of the prasad. The special pastime in the morning when you asked in which direction is Sri Govardhan ji, and by mistake one devotee pointed in the wrong direction, then after some time, You got up and sat in the right direction facing Sri Govardhan ji. And two times you spoke about kala jamun, and I was fearful that you might say something for those who had not eaten, but you heard my prayer and did not speak anything further. I was very much tensed, but you managed and tackled me. Your heartfelt and extreme gratitude towards devotees serving in the kitchen and especially to the hundreds of matajis who are cooking chapatis for all devotees. Your heartfelt appreciation for your Godbrothers and Godsisters is really inspiring. The Vrajavasis who gave land for the yatra pandal and who helped in all yatra arrangements. Keep me in your shelter and the shelter of your servant of your servants. I am planning to assist in US preaching, so please give me strength, shelter, and encouragement for this new project. I am really feeling insignificant and powerless and unqualified, but by your mercy, Srila Gurudev, allow me to assist my Shiksha Gurus and You in service to Srila Prabhupada.\n Srila Prabhupada ki Jai\n Srila Gurudev ki Jai\n Gaur Bhakta Vrinda ki Jai\n Thank You so much.\n Your insignificant Servant of Servant of Servants\n Pratik Mohta"

There was an instance where you were initiating one mataji, and accidentally you said the initiated name and then said \"das\" instead of \"devi dasi\". You immediately corrected yourself and said, \"Oh, sorry! I am your das and your name is ___ devi dasi.\" Here, I could understand the humility you had. In front of everyone, at that particular time when everyone was accepting you as their spiritual master, you still retained the mood of servant of servant of servant.\n \n In the Kartik Yatra, on the day of Prabhupad\u0027s disappearance, Vaishashikha Pr had come, and you were with him, showing him around the whole Pandal. When you were exiting the Pandal and a car was waiting to take you back, Srila Prabhupada’s lecture started in the Pandal, and your face bloomed with joy. As soon as possible, you went and sat on a chair and heard the lecture of Prabhupada very attentively. Your love for Prabhupada and eagerness to hear from him inspired me a lot.\n \n Thank you so much, Maharaj, for everything. You are the reason I am trying to practice in Krishna consciousness. Your lectures have been the nourishing water for my bhakti lata.\n \n I pray that I may one day develop even a single drop of the love and eagerness that you have for Srila Prabhupada. I also pray that I may mould my body, mind, and words in such a way that they bring even a small amount of pleasure to your divine heart.\n \n Thank you,\n Your aspiring servant of the servant,\n Pratyush"

Speaking of Śrīla Rādhānātha Swāmī Mahārāja, he explained how such an exalted speaker—learned, realized, empowered—does not need to prepare for any class, yet still dedicates hours to research, references, notes, and insights from our ācāryas.\n \n When asked why, Mahārāja replied:\n “There are so many people who come to listen to Kṛṣṇa-kathā. This is a very precious time of their life. It is my responsibility to ensure they receive the best possible benefit. They could spend this time elsewhere, yet they choose to hear Kṛṣṇa-kathā.”\n \n This profound sense of responsibility—rooted deeply in humility—is exactly what we witness in you, Guru Mahārāja.\n \n I vividly remember your powerful class on Balarāma Pūrṇimā, when you said with complete honesty:\n “I have not prepared to give this class.”\n Such transparent humility can arise only from one who is truly sincere. Although honored, respected, and spiritually empowered, you never use these gifts for self-glorification. You use everything solely in the service of Guru, Gaurāṅga, and the Vaiṣṇavas.\n \n Last year, during a Vyāsa Pūjā offering, Śrīla Bhakti Vijñāna Goswāmī Mahārāja shared the beautiful analogy of the vatsa, the small calf.\n \n A mother cow’s love is spontaneous, overflowing, unconditional.\n Her milk flows joyfully simply because her calf needs nourishment.\n \n Similarly, a genuine Guru showers his disciples with unending, selfless love—vātsalya-rasa—constantly desiring their spiritual upliftment, protection, and eternal welfare.\n \n In return, the disciple must develop the same pure, simple dependence that the calf has for its mother—\n following naturally, trusting completely,\n receiving guidance with gratitude and surrender.\n \n But there is also a solemn warning in this analogy:\n When the calf grows horns and begins to poke the mother’s udder, she understands that the calf no longer needs her milk. Naturally, the flow becomes less.\n \n Likewise, when a disciple begins to think—\n “I know more than my Guru Mahārāja…”\n “I no longer need his mercy…”\n “I can advance on my own…”\n \n —then the flow of blessings and mercy becomes thinner.\n \n Gurudeva, on this sacred day, we pray sincerely that\n we may never grow such horns.\n May we remain forever as humble, grateful calves—\n fully dependent on your love, protection, and guidance.\n \n May we always honor your humility, your dedication, your sincerity, and your unwavering commitment to the mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n \n Our Collective Prayer\n \n त्वया ह्रष्टा वयं नित्यं\n त्वदीयं सेवकं मनः\n त्वदाज्ञायां स्थितं चित्तं\n त्वत्पदाब्जेषु लिनताम्\n \n tvayā hṛṣṭā vayaṁ nityaṁ\n tvadīyaṁ sevakaṁ manaḥ\n tvad-ājñāyāṁ sthitaṁ cittaṁ\n tvat-padābjeṣu līnatām\n \n May we always delight in serving you.\n May our minds remain your servants forever.\n May our hearts stay fixed in your instructions.\n May our lives remain surrendered at your lotus feet.\n \n Thank you, Gurudeva.\n Hare Kṛṣṇa.\n \n Your servant and disciple,\n Prayag Rāj Dās"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Dear Guru Maharaj,\n \n Please accept my humble obeisances.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada!!\n \n This time I got an opportunity to write this offering from the most auspicious place of Ter Kadamba in Vrindavan. I was simply meditating how surreal it is to be a part of such a glorious parampara. Without your mercy, I never would have ever taken to Bhakti. Thank you so much, Maharaj.\n \n Words are not sufficient to really describe the mercy we receive from you, Maharaj. Every passing day I understand how much you have done for us and sacrificed for us. The first time I read *Journey Home*, it was kind of mystical and inspiring, but when I keep on hearing and reading, I understand the depths of your realizations and the sacredness of your life and nature. Thank you for mercifully coming to this world and giving hope to fallen fools like me.\n \n Last year was very special for me as we got initiated by you. In my life, not many times have I felt the sensation of divineness surrounding me, and certainly, nothing was more than the moment we came before you during initiation. The few moments you saw into my eyes felt like an eternity. I am most grateful to you because, in spite of seeing all the dirt in my heart and how sinful I am, you still agreed to give shelter to me at your lotus feet.\n \n When we were in GEV, we got an opportunity to interact with the devotees there. Hearing them, we could understand your heart. Vrindavan is always manifested in your heart. Like it’s mentioned in the bhajan, \"Tomara hrdaye sada Govinda Vishram…\", the pastimes of Lord are always manifested in your heart, and GEV is just a peek into your divine heart and your oceanic love for The Lordships.\n \n In the recent Kartik yatra, we were showered with nectarean pastimes of The Lordships. But I was so much touched by the kirtans. One thing I understood when you asked us to raise our hands and chant out loud from the heart is that you give us a chance to chant the pure holy names. It reminds me of the pastime where SP said that because this devotee once purely chanted the holy name in Vrindavan, he was taken by the Lord. Every action of yours has a deep meaning attached to it. When will the day come where I can understand your heart filled with compassion? This material world has nothing tangible to offer, but the fool that I am, I still have attraction to it. When will the day come where I will be drowning, tasting the nectar of love from your compassionate heart? I cry and cry and weep thinking of how big a fool I am to not take seriously your instructions. I feel a lot of separation from you, and there is nothing but prayers I can offer to the Lord to get your association.\n \n I know that I cannot approach you with my currently diseased state, but I promise you, Maharaj, that I will give the last of my breath in serving this mission of Srila Prabhupada. I am constantly praying that someday I will be empowered to do something which will please you. I sincerely pray to you that whatever service comes, I neither do it for my own personal aggrandizement nor for any fame, post, or prestige.\n \n The ashram life, as I understand it, is like *Ksurasya dhara sucira sramasya…* there is a thin line saying where there is a limit. I hope and pray that I never cross that and trap myself again in the web of material life.\n \n I beg and pray to The Lordships that lifetime after lifetime I get an opportunity to serve at your lotus feet. I have no personal aspirations, but there is a burning desire to serve you and Vaishnavas. Please use me as an instrument in your hand and make me move as you like.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Prayojana ācārya das"

It was the most beautiful moment of my life—to receive your grace and mercy in the form of initiation. I don’t know how I became so fortunate to have you as my spiritual master; it is definitely not due to my qualification, but purely your compassion and mercy.\nI still remember seeing you for the first time at Sadhu Sanga 2024. Your glance was like beaming moonlight falling upon fallen souls like us, soothing and uplifting them. It was a magical moment for me. Getting your association in the presence of Kalachandji was another divine experience of my life, and ever since then, I had accepted you as my spiritual master.\nYour sensitivity towards devotees truly touches me—the way you reciprocate with each and every soul, irrespective of their background, is amazing. This reminds me of another event at Sadhu Sanga 2025, where you were so humble, sitting on the ground with your godbrother, while devotees were hovering around you, eager to have your darśan. I happened to come and offer my obeisances, and as soon as we rose, you were directly glancing at us—showering your blessings through your sparkling eyes and compassionate smile. That moment showed how personally you reciprocate with everyone.\nYour mercy has also always been seen through your disciples. Somehow or other, they have consistently helped me move forward with proper guidance, reminding me to stay focused on what is truly important—the essence of everything: to please Kṛṣṇa.\nI am eternally indebted to you, Guru Mahārāja, and to our whole Gauḍīya paramparā for giving me this gift of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and a family in which I can practice it. May your lectures and instructions always guide and nourish me on this journey. And may I always act in a way that pleases the devotees, you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and Śrī Kṛṣṇa.\n\nWishing you a very happy and blissful 75th Vyāsa-pūjā, Guru Mahārāja.\n\nYour servant,\nPreetiGopikā Devī dāsī"

You always try to imbibe this spirit in all of us, but I struggle to appreciate other devotees\u0027 wonderful services, of theirs helping so many, so many souls come close to the Lotus Feet of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nOn this most auspicious occasion of Your Divine appearance, I pray at your lotus feet that I should remain loyal to the vows I took at initiation and love and appreciate all devotees, and continue to render service till the end of life.\nSeeking your blessings.\n\nYour servant,\nPrem Nartan Das."

All glories to Sri Guru and Gauranga!\n \n Gurudev, every year this day is the most special for us, and so it is today. You have always been giving us so much for so many years, and you are still continuing to give.\n \n By your tireless and patient efforts, the temple of Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji has become a shelter for me, like so many others. I started my spiritual journey here. The first time I had the chance to come here was during the Sharad Purnima Festival of 1998, when you and H.H. Giriraj Maharaj had given the class. The altar was so beautifully decorated by sincere devotees for the pleasure of Their Lordships. That was the first time I had the opportunity to see you.\n \n You have arranged so many yatras over the years. The yatras have evolved so much by your desire to serve the devotees: sumptuous prasadam cooked and served, taking care of Varishta Vaishnavas and also kids, nourishing classes. I have attended many yatras, sometimes because my friends were attending, sometimes out of eagerness to get blessings at the holy places after having heard from you about the places. The effect of the hearing, chanting, and association during the yatra, I am able to perceive now after so many years, and I feel grateful for the opportunity to attend the yatras.\n \n Also, thank you for the caring Godbrothers and Godsisters whose constant guidance and nudging has pushed me to where I am today. They were always there to help when I was at a crossroads.\n \n Maharaj, you give us so much in your classes. You prepare your classes so meticulously so that anyone can understand. You always stress on trnad api sunicena... and when practiced as you instruct, it works like a magic pill in many trying situations. You teach us to work together and love and respect everyone. You tell us the pastimes of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Krishna with so much detail. If I can appreciate and understand the Lord even to an infinitesimal amount, it is because of those sweet narrations.\n You always speak on the glories of the holy names and how to take shelter of the holy names. Praying that I can sincerely and with determination follow what you teach us, Maharaj.\n \n I have not had the opportunity to have your personal association. But I have Godsisters who have had your personal guidance and are sincerely serving you. When I am in their midst, when we discuss and meditate on your instructions, then I can feel that you are present there.\n \n Gurudev, it is not possible to imagine a life without devotional service. If you had not engaged me in Krishna Consciousness, life would have been full of expectations, envy, comparison, and so many other things to do, completely sunk in the ocean of the material world. But still, in my heart, there is not enough gratitude for this life-saving boat that you have given. Praying that I can develop more and more appreciation for you and Srila Prabhupada and more gratitude so that I can truly commit myself to you under all situations. \n \n Aspiring to be servant of your servant,\n Prema Kishori ddasi"

All glories to you.\n \nOn the most glorious \u0026 special occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja day, I would like to humbly express my gratitude for accepting this fallen soul as your disciple. Your compassion is boundless and you are a reservoir of mercy. Although, many of your disciples have hardly got your personal association and specific instructions from you, and I being one amongst them, it is my conviction that inspite of not knowing me and many others personally, you are always caring and reciprocating with us by praying to the Lord for our spiritual upliftment. It\u0027s only due to your and the Vaishnavas\u0027 prayers and selfless love for us, that we make advancement in our attachment for the Lord. Else, what can I expect, being a fallen soul overwhelmed with anarthas. We understand from guru, sadhus, and sastra that the role of guru is that he gives Krsna to his disciples and if the disciple makes advancement in the form of his attachment towards guru, sadhus, sastra, and the Lord, then that is the success of guru\u0027s role. Your life is dedicated only to please Srila Prabhupada \u0026 Krsna and bring us closer to them in their service, as well as connect us to the caitya guru so we could receive guidance at the relevant time. In a letter, Srila Prabhupada writes to a disciple that the guru is present wherever a disciple wants him to be and since you aren\u0027t able to physically bestow your association, your prayers for us make all the necessary adjustments and arrangements so we could be steady in devotion to them and strive to please them.\n \n Your emphasis on reading Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books \u0026 executing the limbs of bhakti with faith shows how you are simply reiterating what Srila Prabhupada stated many times, quoting from the Svetasvatara Upanisad – that disciples can make progress only if they develop implicit faith in guru and Krsna simultaneously. Also, following Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur, you always emphasize the most essential aspects of bhakti, i.e., nama ruci, vaisnava seva, jiva daya \u0026 becoming dasanudas. Thus, one can see how expertly \u0026 loyally you pass down the message of our acharyas.\n \n Having personally seen as well as heard about you from senior Vaishnavas, I understand that you are an extraordinary special associate of Srila Prabhupada meant to achieve extraordinary results. Whether it be sadhana wrt to all limbs of bhakti, relations \u0026 behavior with devotees senior, equals \u0026 juniors and people in general, qualities, sensitivity, being a guru \u0026 leader, strictness, practicality, services, austerity, all kinds of projects, etc., you have always demonstrated the highest level of example for all of us to follow. Your classes are outstanding \u0026 imbued with so much gratitude, absorption in the lilas, grounded in philosophy and humility, providing the essential commentaries of acharyas in such a lucid way that anyone can appreciate and relish it to one\u0027s heart\u0027s content. Your vani is truly an incredible source of inspiration for all of us. In order to give us this incredible nectar, I can only imagine how much effort, austerity \u0026 pain of love you go through. Whenever you interact with someone, it\u0027s filled with multiple lessons to be learned and reminds us of the example of achieving many targets simultaneously with one arrow. Only a Vaishnava of such a high caliber could manifest all these extraordinary qualities.\n \n Your glories are certainly unlimited, nonetheless, they keep expanding. I truly wish and pray to the Lord that with all my small \u0026 humble endeavors, I strive to please you more and more as time passes, but I need the strength to do this due to the many anarthas that I possess. Only by your causeless mercy, prayers, and kindness can I do this. I also pray with all my heart and sincere desire that your health remains good so that you could continue to bestow your physical association to all of us for many years to come in the service of Srila Prabhupada. Lastly, I would like to express that if by immense fortune, if I get a chance to serve your vapuh then I eagerly look forward to it. In any case, I always aspire to serve and please you \u0026 the devotees and strive to become dasanudas.\n \n Your insignificant servant trying to serve in separation,\n Prema Rasa Das Chowpatty – Mumbai"

        "Your Offering ":  "Respected Gurudev,\n Please accept my humble and prostrated obeisances at your lotus feet.\n \n \"jogyata vicare kichu nahi payi\n  tomara karuna sara\"\n \n As I reflect on my journey of Krishna consciousness, I understand that it is your mercy that has saved me, nurtured me, and brought me to this situation.\n \n 1st instalment 2003\n \n It was your heart\u0027s longing to preach to youths in universities mano abhistam. You had been cultivating hundreds of youths in tens of universities in America with no help of manpower, finances, vehicle, etc. Being obedient to Srila Prabhupada\u0027s representatives, you agreed to move to Chowpatty for services. The university preaching closed down one by one in your absence. You accepted it gratefully and planted that seed of desire in your disciples and empowered them. HG Radheshyam pr recollects that it is your letter on youth preaching, the instructions, and dust of your lotus feet that is the foundation and sustenance sthapitam yena bhutale. Your inspired HG Rasikanand pr to go to IIT Kharagpur and begin preaching there under the guidance of HG Radheshyam prabhu. I am the recipient of that mercy which brought me to Srila Prabhupada\u0027s lotus feet your Divine residence.\n \n 2nd instalment 2008\n \n I was nurtured by the love, care, training, and education offered by HG Radheshyam pr and the devotees assisting him. A blissful journey of six years with ever-increasing joy. I was about to graduate and move to Pune when we were told that we should go to Srila Prabhupada\u0027s birthplace and serve in Kolkata. You gave an historical class on \"Glories of Kolkata\" in 2008 which changed the direction of our life. You desired a revolution in Kolkata and developments at His Divine Grace\u0027s birthplace. All of us moved from IIT Kharagpur to Kolkata to embark on fulfilling your desire to serve your Gurudev. Thus, we received our Prabhudatta desha and a lifetime of service.\n \n 3rd Instalment 2018-19\n \n There was a historical meeting in NOIDA where you spoke with the temple council about developing Srila Prabhupada\u0027s historical places and Prabhupada\u0027s desire to build a unique and gorgeous temple. Consequently, HG Acaryaratna pr and a set of devotees including me were asked to move to new temple land at Newtown for the development of the project. We had the good fortune of meeting you in Govardhan Eco Village to understand your vision for the project. You personally intervened to settle the issues then and gave us so much confidence to take up the impossible project for Srila Prabhupada. It is the result of your mercy and prayers that we are here at Newtown trying our little to fulfill this dream of yours.\n \n 4th instalment 2020-2025\n \n We never believed in ourselves to be able to do the project. You encouraged that \"my boys would do it\" and personally showered your love and inspired us for the same. It is literally a metamorphosis from a caterpillar to a butterfly soaring in the sky. Your regular visits, constant support, and inspiration to the well-wishers literally created the metamorphosis. Thus, today we are able to embark on the first phase of the dream temple that Srila Prabhupada envisioned 55 years back in 1970.\n \n Thus, it is only by your mercy that I have been able to practice bhakti and become an instrument in the hands of your servants. I owe my life to you, and it is my prayer that I can do something to please you and assist you to serve your Gurudev. The fuel and the internal spirit to keep us going year after year amidst the turbulence of the world is your divine example and your lectures. The annual Kartik yatras are the boosters of our Krishna consciousness. I am very grateful to be your disciple and serve you in the mood of being a servant of your servant. I am constantly experiencing the nectar, warmth, and love from the association that you have inspired. I am very grateful to you for being my savior and for your unlimited love towards us.\n \n Thank you for being the expert captain of the ship to sail us across the material ocean to reach the spiritual abode. I am very confident that you can sail us across the ocean, but I am fearful that I may jump off the ship being deviated by the petty allurements of the fearsome ocean. My dear Gurudev, please pick me up and accept me with all my shortcomings. I do not have any hope if not for your mercy that qualifies this fallen soul.\n \n \"Karuna na hoile kandiya kandiya\n  prana na rakhibo ara\"\n \n Thank you for all the gifts you have given us at every moment.\n Your insignificant disciple,\n Prema svarupa das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurumaharaj,\n \n Please accept my humble obeisances.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n On this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja, I find myself short of words. It is truly difficult for an insignificant and ignorant person like me to properly describe your glories. Still, by your causeless mercy, I am attempting to express a few words of gratitude.\n When I look back at my journey in Krishna consciousness, all I can see is the immense amount of love, care, support, and nourishment that I have received from our Radha Gopinath Mandir congregation. Whatever I am today, whatever good qualities people may see in me, are simply a tiny spark of what I have learned and received from this glorious community, your community nurtured and guided under your compassionate leadership.\n It was only after coming to the West that I truly realized the priceless treasure I had left behind. Each day, I try to put my full faith and conviction in your instructions, and I strive to live in a way that will bring you even the slightest happiness.\n I possess no special qualifications or abilities to please you, Gurumaharaj. All I can do is sincerely try to live by your teachings. If I can imbibe even a small fraction of what you instruct, I will consider my life successful.\n On your 75th Vyas Puja year, my heartfelt prayer is that Krishna blesses you with long life, good health, unshakeable spiritual strength, and unlimited opportunities to continue inspiring millions of souls across the world. May your compassionate guidance continue to illuminate the path for all of us. May we, your insignificant servants, always remain united in serving your mission with sincerity, humility, and devotion.\n Thank you, Gurumaharaj, for your endless mercy. And Gurumaharaj, just the simple act of signing this offering as “Yours” fills my heart with immense joy and deep shelter, because it reminds me that I belong to you.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Premanjani Devi Dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "75th VYAS PUJA OFFERING 2025 TO H.H. RADHANATH SWAMI MAHARAJ\n \n Param Pujya Guru Maharaj,\n \n Please accept my most humble obeisances.\n All Glories to Sri Guru and Gauranga. All Glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n I seek the blessings of all the Vaishnavas to express few words on this auspicious occasion.\n Maharaj, this year 2025, Kartik Yatra to Govardhan was amazing and well planned. To organize a yatra for 12,000+ devotees with so many facilities is not possible, and that too for 7 days. But due to your desire and empowerment, the yatra happened in a grand way videos are available to witness, and the whole Vaishnava community, including devotees from other Parampara, were amazed to witness and very appreciative. The desire of Srila Prabhupada, Guru Parampara, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu to spread the Holy names all over the world must have surely been fulfilled, and they must have showered their blessings. This is just not my opinion; we have all witnessed this grand event without any untoward incident. The Vrajwasi who offered his 9-acre agricultural field to make a pandal in Govardhan; the preparations started a few months earlier. At that time, it was raining in Vrindavan. A thought came, \"What will happen if it rains during the yatra? Everything will collapse, and there will be lots of difficulty managing such a huge event.\" It appeared very difficult and impossible. But the Vrajwasi said, \"Depend on Krsna. The Lord will protect the yatra against rains as He protected the Vrajwasis 5,000 years ago.\" Wow, truly the Lord protected the yatra, and immediately after the yatra, the rain showered. This is the power of a pure devotee. Maharaj, your lectures during the yatra took us to the pastimes of the Lord live, and the kirtans were amazing. We all have witnessed your deep absorption both in katha and kirtan. Personally, I felt your personal association was available to all your disciples, just like all the Vrajwasis were having personal association with the Lord during the Govardhan Lila. I offer my deepest gratitude to all the devotees who were working day and night for months to organize this yatra. The management was absolute because it is not humanly possible to meet the needs of all individual devotees so precisely.\n \n Maharaj, your Krsna katha during the yatra was not only narrating the pastimes of the Lord but revealing subtle instructions. In all your lectures, while narrating the sweet pastimes of the Lord, you give instructions. On this occasion, I would like to cite a few lectures of yours for the pleasure of all Vaishnavas and to ponder over the subtle instructions given by you for all of us to follow carefully.\n \n 1. Amanina mana dena – We give all respect to others and expect none in return, that we do our service not for recognition but for the purification of our heart.\n 2. Ahankar: Ahankar is removed by the mercy of the Lord and not by our efforts. It may take time, but not much time considering millions and millions of births we have been working on it and chanting its glories. We have created a monster, but Krsna can kill that demon, and He will through His holy names, through the blessings of Guru, through seva. If we have sincerity, gradually it will happen. It may take your whole life, but that’s not too much time considering you have been building it, nourishing it for many lifetimes. But in the process, you have to be willing to fight the lower tendencies. First thing, do not find faults in others. Krsna curbed the false pride of Kaliya. Krsna curbed the ego of Indra. First, He cleansed the ego of a great demon, and now He is about to cleanse the ego of a great demigod. Indra is actually a devotee; we should never insult Indra because he is a great devotee, but somehow He uses this particular devotee to show by example how careful we should be.\n \n 3. Enthusiasm and patience = True surrender: We have to be patient, but at the same time, we have to work very hard with great enthusiasm. And if we are enthusiastic and patient, which is based on faith in the words of God, with the mercy of God, then with the combination of two is surrender.\n \n Maharaj, on this auspicious day, we all seek blessings from you for full protection, as we are all like crying babies, very close to Maya, and bound to do nonsense. We request you to forgive us and continue to shower your causeless mercy, and we all will try our best to serve you and Srila Prabhupada.\n Praying to all Vaishnavas to bless, so that I shed down my enjoying spirit and develop the service attitude in the mood of a servant of servants.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Premkirtan das\n Hyderabad."

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n On this sacred occasion of your 75th Vyasa-puja, I stand overwhelmed with gratitude for your boundless compassion and the unparalleled gift of your guidance. Whatever little devotional life we have is entirely by your causeless mercy.\n \n By your vision and dedication, Bhaktivedanta Hospital came into existence—a sanctuary of service, compassion, and spiritual upliftment. I consider it my greatest fortune to be able to serve as an intensivist in this holy institution, one of the priceless projects built upon your teachings and your heart’s desire to offer dignified service to humanity. Every day, the devotional environment here reminds me that medicine, when infused with bhakti, becomes a sacred offering to the Lord.\n \n My wife, by your mercy, is also blessed with the opportunity to serve—as a psychological counselor on Hare Krishna TV and as a psychotherapist in Bhaktivedanta Hospital. We continuously feel your grace in allowing us to contribute, in our small ways, to your mission.\n \n Yet, Guru Maharaj, with deep humility I admit that we are struggling in our sadhana. Despite being surrounded by so much mercy, we fall short in discipline and purity. Still, we remain hopeful—because your loving encouragement gives us faith that even our small, imperfect efforts can eventually grow into sincere devotion. We pray for the strength to follow your instructions more seriously, to improve our sadhana, services, and relation with Vaishnavas and to become worthy instruments in your mission.\n \n This Kartik, it was a profound blessing to hear your nectarean lectures in the association of nearly 12,000 devotees during the Govardhan Yatra. Sitting at your feet, surrounded by such an ocean of devotees, I felt once again how your words have the power to awaken the deepest longing for bhakti and inspire transformation in countless hearts.\n \n On this auspicious day of your appearance, I pray for your health, strength, and long life, so that millions more may receive shelter and hope through you. Thank you, Guru Maharaj, for your incomparable kindness, for uplifting our lives, and for giving us an opportunity to serve in your divine mission.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Premprayojan Das\n Archanagopika Devi Dasi and Sankarshan"

Guru Maharaj, you radiated the teachings of Srila Prabhupada that brought transformation into my life.\n Thank you for all the captivating lectures that you give, as during the lectures, you create the hunger for more and the possibilities of opportunities emerging from within to deepen the love for Lord Krishna and Radharani.\n \n Thank you for giving me your shelter and accepting me as your disciple.\n \n Here is a poem that a friend wrote which I wanted to share with you, as it expresses my gratitude.\n \n Guru Maharaj, Maharaj, it is through your grace I have found grace.

I\u0027ll just make an effort to offer you what comes from you, your true qualities of humility, concern, affection, firmness, attention to detail, priority, guidance, being strict for yourself but very understanding and supportive to others, and many other extraordinary good qualities. You preach what you follow yourself.\n Maharaj, you have been an inspiration to one and many.\n My recent yatra with you and fellow devotees to Govardhan has made a lasting impression of such wonderful devotees we have in our congregation.\n I happened to be visiting Surya Kund, and we, along with others, boarded a bus the last bus arranged for latecomers which did not have a coordinator, rather a bus leader. The bus driver took us to a place where the other buses were not there.\n Many devotees were not satisfied, and they argued with the driver, as walking on an unknown path was risky for senior citizens.\n He was helpless and confused, so he took the help of a local small boy around 15 years old and asked him to navigate the path for all of us.\n And low and behold, it was a very uneven road, and to my nightmare, I tripped and slipped, falling on my knee.\n It was hard for me to get up, but all around me were being extremely careful and helpful, making all arrangements from a chair to a pickup, to arranging an auto to take me to the taxi with security.\n All of them were PUNE devotees.\n I didn\u0027t know them, and they didn\u0027t know me, but there was amazing coordination to help me out with a daring spirit and helpful attitude.\n A couple and their daughter continuously accompanied me and were there to comfort me. They sacrificed their visit to temples and all the places and were there to monitor and make me feel at ease and comfort me with their presence.\n This spirit of sacrifice, help, and concern trickles down from you, Maharaj, to Jhanva mataji, and then to her council members. I am so grateful to the Pune devotees as their concern and affection made me oblivious of my own pain. I was moved by their concern and help at the time when I needed it the most. Naina Manjari mataji, when I asked her to be with fellow yatris to visit all places, so genuinely quoted that Radhanath Maharaj says, \"More important are people than any projects.\" This attitude brought tears to my eyes, and she was actually living by it without any remorse of missing out on places and temples.\n \n I am short of words, Maharaj, the way they have been nurtured under your guidance.\n May this spirit of sacrifice, care, and love also trickle into me through your mercy, Maharaj, so that I can offer a simple flower of affection and care to all who come across my way and of whom you can feel proud.\n \n In your service,\n Regards,\n Priti Gaurangi dd"

Please accept my humble pranams!\n\nMaharaj, I am writing my heartfelt feelings to you without much thought because when you talk to your dear ones, you do not calculate things in mind and write officially! I am just trying to say a few simple words to express my gratitude.\n\nLast year, very mercifully, you took me also under your divine shelter despite being unqualified unlike all your other disciples. This reminds me how Lord Chaitanya gave mercy to most unqualified candidates also. I have no spiritual background, neither do I come from a devotee family, nor did I ever attend any Hari katha before coming into ISKCON. But still, carrying forward Srila Prabhupada’s compassion, you are giving shelter to many souls.\n\nInitially, I was not sure how to know who my spiritual master is. I always thought he should be the one with whom I can personally meet and discuss and take instructions. Otherwise, how will He know my struggles, strengths, weaknesses, etc. And that seemed like a far possibility with you, Maharaj. And that still remains the reality today as well. But while interacting with some of your disciples who are senior to me, I realized how you are always deeply connected with all your disciples who are committed to their vows. How you are personally involved in their lives and blessing them although they are physically very far from you. There are innumerable such pastimes to list a few. You gave hope to Vrindavan Prabhu when he wanted to end his life, saying that You need him. You took care of some disciples, [mtjs] like a loving father. You arranged for some very eager devotees who were financially incapable of joining yatras. You personally prayed for a young [mtj] disciple who just got initiated by you and immediately after that met with an accidental death.\n\nMany such instances made me realize that the connection is always very strong from your end. It is the disciple’s responsibility to connect by following the instructions given in classes and initiation vows sincerely. But for doing that also, I need your blessings, Maharaj. I need blessings to chant for your and Krishna’s pleasure, to read and absorb Srimad Bhagavatam and Chaitanya Charitamrit, to hear your kathas and imbibe the essence in my dealings. I remember how in one class you said, “Hearing means willingness to follow.”\n\nYour words, “Every situation is an opportunity to remember and surrender to Krishna, and it is Krishna’s divine arrangement to bring us closer to Him,” give me faith and determination to face all the situations and adversities that come on my way. Maharaj, on your Vyas Puja day, this unqualified disciple has nothing to offer to you except a promise that I am trying hard to follow your instructions with the hope that one day I will please you and my life will be perfect! To share my deepest desire with you, Maharaj, I really want to serve you in fulfilling the mission of Srila Prabhupada to spread the glories of devotional service to the best of my capacity. I seek blessings and empowerment to become a little instrument in your hands if you so desire.\n\nBegging for your mercy always,\nYour insignificant disciple,\n…Priti Radha Devi Dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Meeting with our dear Guru Maharaj in Alachua\n ________________________________________\n May/June 2025\n It was the Memorial Day long weekend in the United States, a time when the Sadhu Sanga retreat is held annually. Devotees from across the country were traveling to attend, and it had been announced that several esteemed sannyasis and senior Vaishnavas would be present. Immediately following Sadhu Sanga, a special memorial program was scheduled in Deland, Florida, to honor the divine memory of His Holiness Bhakti Charu Maharaj. Many devotees from Atlanta planned to attend both events and then continue to Alachua, where our beloved spiritual master, His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj, was expected to spend a few days.\n It was announced that Guru Maharaj would be giving the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam class on Wednesday, followed by a panel discussion on Thursday evening with His Holiness Sivarama Swami Maharaj. All disciples were invited to attend the program in the temple room.\n Revathy and I decided to drive to Alachua from Atlanta, on Thursday to attend the panel discussion. We left Atlanta around 11:30 a.m. and reached Alachua by 5:00 p.m. After checking into a Holiday Inn and freshening up, we arrived at the temple by 5:35 p.m., only to find it surprisingly quiet. The temple room was nearly empty, and we saw very few devotees. Concerned, we tried reaching out to friends from Atlanta to confirm whether the program was still on, but received no immediate responses. We left messages, unsure of what to do next.\n While pondering our situation, I noticed a quiet Brahmachari honoring prasadam. I approached him and asked if the program had been canceled or moved. With a bright smile, he greeted me warmly, saying, “I’m so happy to see you, Mataji!” I replied, “I\u0027m very happy to see you too.” When I inquired about the panel discussion, he informed me—rather regretfully—that it had recently been canceled.\n A bit disheartened, I asked if there were any other programs happening or if there might be a chance for a darshan with Guru Maharaj. He suggested I check with some matajis in the temple kitchen. As I made my way there, he suddenly came running to me with a spark of inspiration: “Call Pran Govind Prabhu. He’s with Maharaj and might know if there’s a home program.” He gave me the number, but as I already had it saved, I called immediately.\n To my relief, Pran Govind Prabhu answered. I introduced myself and explained that we had driven all the way from Atlanta, hoping for even a brief darshan with Guru Maharaj. He asked, “Did you come from Charlotte?” and I clarified, “No, from Atlanta.” He said, “Give me ten minutes. I will speak with Guru Maharaj and let you know.”\n While waiting in the temple room, Revathy and I debated whether we should just return home. I was growing impatient and felt sure no one would call us back. Our friends responded that since the program was canceled, they left to Orlando. Just as we reversed the car, ready to leave, my phone rang.\n It was Pran Govind Prabhu: “Mother Preethivilasini, where are you?”\n “I’m still at the temple,” I replied.\n He said, “Guru Maharaj wants to talk to you!”\n I was stunned. “What?! Okay!” I put the phone on speaker so Revathy could hear.\n Then came the most unexpected and heart-melting moment.\n “Hare Krishna Preethivilasini Mataji, please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada,” came the kind and gentle voice of our Guru Maharaj.\n Overwhelmed and choked up, we both offered our respectful obeisances and replied, “Hare Krishna Guru Maharaj!”\n He continued, “So you drove all the way from Atlanta?”\n “Yes, Maharaj.”\n “Unfortunately, the program was canceled. Sivarama Maharaj decided to cancel, and I was pulled into some private meetings; it has been an exhausting day. I’m sorry you came all this way only to find it canceled.”\n We quickly responded, “Please, Maharaj, don’t apologize. We understand completely. Thank you so much for calling us—it means the world to us.”\n Then came the moment we will never forget.\n “Since you came all the way,” he said, “I will come and see you.”\n We were stunned and said, “Maharaj!?”\n He said, “How many of you are there?”\n “Just the two of us—my friend Revathy and me.”\n He smiled, “I’ll come under one condition: I will meet you under a tree in the parking lot. I’m not coming inside the temple or anywhere there’s a crowd. This visit is just for you two.”\n We said, “Guru Maharaj, we do not want you to take the trouble; we will come and see you there.”\n He said, “Yes, it is a great trouble; I am surrounded by an ocean of crocodiles and snakes,” and he chuckled. He said, “I will see you in about 15 minutes.”\n We were speechless.\n We waited under a tree, soaking in the surreal beauty of the moment. Revathy said, “Should we ask him to sign a book? Or maybe we should prepare a spiritual question?” We nervously rehearsed what we might say.\n But suddenly, it began to rain heavily—almost apocalyptically. We had to run to the car for shelter. I told Revathy, “Maybe we’re not destined to meet him after all.”\n She calmly replied, “Who told you rain is a bad omen? This rain is a blessing—it means Guru Maharaj will come.”\n I messaged Pran Govind Prabhu about the rain, saying Guru Maharaj needs shelter. His reply: “We will be there soon!”\n Within minutes, a car zipped into the parking lot—it was Guru Maharaj and Pran Govind Prabhu!\n We ran to the car and offered our obeisances. As we got up, Maharaj stepped out gracefully, looked up at the rain, and said with joy, “Ah! I like the rain!” Then he walked to the tree and gestured, “Come, come to the tree.”\n Despite the rain, he was cheerful, laughing and speaking with his characteristic warmth and humility.\n I said, “Guru Maharaj, it is raining; should we go to a place where there is shelter? You are getting wet.” He said, “Where is it?” I showed a distant shelter, and he dismissed that option, saying, “By the time we get there, we are going to get more wet!” and we agreed.\n I said, “Guru Maharaj, I’m so grateful that you prayed for my husband when he passed in 2020. I feel assured, by your mercy, that he has reached a safe destination.” He looked at me with such compassion. I continued, “Please bless us, that we may develop even a little love for Krishna and always remain loyal to you.”\n He smiled.\n I then introduced Revathy, saying, “She has been aspiring to become an initiated disciple of you for 12 years.” Maharaj turned to her with a compassionate glance.\n Revathy humbly said, “Guru Maharaj, you’re supposed to be taking service from us, but here you are serving us instead.”\n Maharaj laughed deeply, “Yes! Indeed, you’re making me serve you!”\n The rain soon stopped.\n Pran Govind Prabhu, who was holding an umbrella, joked, “Even Indra is afraid of you, Maharaj!”\n Maharaj replied, “Now I’m taking credit for things I didn’t do?!” and laughed again.\n Guru Maharaj said, “Don’t you think it’s good the program got canceled? Otherwise, we wouldn’t have had this beautiful meeting under a tree! This is the highlight of my Alachua trip.”\n We were overwhelmed. We replied in unison, “This is the highlight of our lives, Maharaj!”\n Then he asked, “How is Atlanta?” I told him it is very nice and how I’d lived in many places but finally decided to settle there.\n Pran Govind Prabhu added, “She conducts wonderful online classes.”\n Guru Maharaj asked for details about the name of the group and the classes conducted. I shared that our Bhakti Sanga Japa Group has morning chanting, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and Chaitanya Bhāgavata classes, and evening kids\u0027 classes for various age groups. He then asked about our audience reach; I explained that we have a YouTube reach of over 1,000 and about 50–60 regular live attendees.\n He asked, “Who all are the speakers?” I mentioned speakers and attendees from across the U.S., U.K., U.A.E., and India, including Pran Govind Prabhu. Pran Govind Prabhu added the names of several senior devotees like Chandramauli Maharaj and Chaitanya Charan Prabhu.\n Pran Govind Prabhu recalled, “Maharaj, you came into a Bhakti Sanga class while Chandramauli Swami was speaking.”\n Maharaj chuckled and said, “I invaded into his class; I came to see him and sat next to him and joined the class.”\n We told him joyfully, “Yes, Maharaj! That was a highlight for us—we took screenshots and celebrated your darshan, saying Guru Maharaj came to Bhakti Sanga!”\n Soon, Maharaj requested Pran Govind Prabhu’s son to bring two full plates of prasadam. Maharaj said, “Bring nice full plates, not something small.”\n As more devotees noticed Maharaj\u0027s presence, they started coming over. Meanwhile, Pran Govind Prabhu told us we must take pictures, and he started taking pictures of our meeting under the tree!\n As devotees joined in, they also took pictures with him. Guru Maharaj introduced us to them, saying, “These two wonderful ladies came all the way to see me, so I came to meet them.”\n I profusely thanked Pran Govind Prabhu for arranging this wonderful meeting. The brahmachari I had first met later came over with an arati plate. I introduced him to Maharaj, saying he was instrumental in making this meeting happen. The brahmachari smiled and said, “Of course—she’s my Bhakti-śāstrī teacher.” I was surprised to learn that he was Akshar Prabhu, a sincere student from our classes.\n As Pran Govind Prabhu’s son was bringing the plates, Maharaj remarked, “This must be very precious and special; look at the way he is carrying the plates with delicate care.” Later, Maharaj said, “I will give it to them,” and handed them to us with loving care. As we dropped our water bottles trying to accept the plates, others chuckled and said, “Look! Water bottles are on the ground,” and Pran Govind Prabhu said, “Looks like their hands are full!”\n Maharaj asked, “Are you staying tonight?”\n Revathy and I replied, “We’ll check with the hotel front desk. Maybe we’ll return tonight if possible.”\n Maharaj said firmly, “First, eat nicely. Then rest well at the hotel and drive back tomorrow after proper rest.”\n We immediately agreed; it was our spiritual master’s order!\n Maharaj smiled, walked back to his car, and we stood watching until it disappeared from view.\n It was the most unforgettable moment of our lives. Every bite of prasadam tasted like nectar—Mahaprasad from the hands of a pure devotee. That night, we barely slept, our hearts full.\n The next day, we returned to Atlanta—forever transformed.}}\n Jaya Srila Gurudev!\n ________________________________________\n Lessons:\n Revathy reflected: “If there is one thing to deeply imbibe from Guru Maharaj, it is his extraordinary humility.”\n I reflected: Just as Lord Rama ran to receive Vibhishan with apologies for making him wait in the sky, our Guru Maharaj—more compassionate than even the Supreme Lord—crossed all obstacles to give mercy to fallen souls like us.\n The Varāha-Charama Śloka declares that the Lord never forgets His devotees, even if they forget Him. So too, our spiritual master remembers and acknowledges every single soul.\n Guru Maharaj not only speaks of humility in every class—he lives it. In every step, every gesture, every word.\n ________________________________________\n \n P.S. - Revathy is now initiated as Revati Priti devi dasi by Guru Maharaj."

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet,\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada,\n \n On this sacred occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude for your teachings, guidance, and the immense care you provide through the counselor system. Your compassion has shaped my journey in Bhakti in ways I am only now beginning to truly understand.\n \n Your Teachings and Compassion\n As the years pass in Krishna consciousness, I am increasingly realizing that you are a perfect and exemplary master. During the Kartik Yatra 2025, I was deeply moved by your very first class, where you described—based on the teachings of our acharyas—Krishna’s return to Vrindavan after almost a century. By narrating this pastime and revealing the mood of parakīya-bhāva and love in separation, you opened a confidential doorway for all of us. Throughout the yatra, your references to the writings of the acharyas made me feel directly connected to them through you.\n \n How I Experience Connection With You\n Many devotees ask how they can feel close to you without physically spending time with you. But in my own life, I have experienced a deep connection simply by rendering service, reading your books, and associating with devotees in the mood of servant of the servant. Every time I attempt to practice humility—even if only theoretically—I feel remembered by you.\n \n While studying Vilāpa-kusumāñjali by Srila Raghunath Das Goswami, I learned that the real mood of our Goswamis, even in their spiritual forms as manjaris, is to remain the servant of the servant. This mood allows them to relish the happiness that Srimati Radharani feels with Krishna. In the material world, closeness to the object of enjoyment gives pleasure. But in the spiritual world, the more we push others closer to Sri Krishna and situate ourselves as servants of all, the greater the bliss.\n \n Earlier I used to feel that by teaching us to be servant of servant you are giving us the qualification to return to Godhead. Now I understand that you are giving us something far greater—the qualification to enter the highest mellows of the spiritual world, following in the footsteps of our Goswamis.\n \n Service in Jhansi and New Preaching Fields\n It has now been almost a year since I shifted to ISKCON Jhansi, the place where Srila Prabhupada began his divine mission. Here I have experienced Srila Prabhupada’s mercy very tangibly. As you often say, whatever a pure devotee desires, Krishna personally makes it happen. We have seen this through the extraordinary preaching results here—especially in organizing Jhansi’s largest Janmashtami festival, where we wholeheartedly glorified Srila Prabhupada.\n Recently, we also began assisting with youth outreach in Philadelphia. Observing the mindset of people in the United States, I can clearly see how your seminars in the West and your universal principles perfectly address their needs and help nurture their spiritual growth.\n \n My Prayer at Your Lotus Feet\n I pray that just as a night-lotus blossoms by taking shelter of the soothing moonlight, I may always take shelter of your guidance and protection while rendering any service in Bhakti.\n \n Thank you, Guru Maharaj, for calling us to GEV Wada for this year’s Vyasa Puja. It is only by your kindness that I am able to progress even a little on this path.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Priya Govinda Das\n ISKCON Jhansi"

You never display even a drop of false pride and always maintain a mildness around which everyone feels at ease.\n \n You possess qualities, virtues, and values of both human and divine beings. Your dignity is unquestionable. Your vigor and strength are invincible. Your intelligence is insurmountable. Your devotion to Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji is pragmatic, externally active, and internally pure and esoteric.\n \n You have taught us to see both good fortune and apparent misfortune equally, to see how both circumstances somehow provide us with an opportunity for service and surrender. By taking shelter of this teaching, by applying it in practical circumstances that arise in day-to-day life and service, we find a tangible and palpable shelter in you and your loving service.\n \n You have given us all an opportunity to help spread the glorious mission of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in every town and village. You remain our constant source of inspiration and our guiding source in pushing forward this Sankīrtan movement.

Please keep us fixed like tiny dust particles clinging to your divine lotus feet.\n \n Kindly be merciful to us, dear Gurudev, and bless us with intelligence to surrender our false egos, that we may do more than just try to follow your example and teachings; that we may follow them without fear. Kindly bless us that we may always please you. Please accept our sincere and heartfelt gratitude.\n \n Your humble, lowly, and unworthy servants of your servants,\n \n Priya Kumari Devi Dasi"

Those ten days in Govardhan Dham, in the blessed land of Braj Bhoomi, have carved a permanent place in my heart.\n \n Listening to your enlightening katha, joining the soul-melting kirtans, and witnessing the love, care, and devotion you pour upon thousands of devotees has transformed my inner consciousness. To be among nearly 10,000 devotees from all over the world, all experiencing your compassion simultaneously, felt like being part of a spiritual family connected through your lotus heart.\n \n One of the most unforgettable blessings for me was performing Govardhan Parikrama—walking around the sacred hill while hearing your teachings and feeling Giriraj Maharaj’s embrace in every step. Each darshan during the Yatra—Radha Kund, Shyama Kund, Kusum Sarovar, Manasi Ganga—felt more alive because of your presence and instructions echoing within.\n \n Another divine incident that will remain with me forever is the opportunity to serve during Annakut. Witnessing the preparation of 3500+ bhogas, all made using traditional cooking methods, was overwhelming. By Giriraj’s mercy, I was allowed to personally prepare a few bhogas for Him. This was a once-in-a-lifetime blessing—a moment where I felt my life had been gifted a deeper meaning. I will carry that privilege in my heart for the rest of my life.\n \n The way you nurture the atmosphere—with impeccable arrangements, seamless coordination, and a devotional environment that elevates every soul—speaks of your unmatched compassion. Each kirtan filled the heart with longing for pure devotional service, and each darshan strengthened my desire to live closer to the instructions of guru and Gauranga.\n \n Maharaj, whatever little sincerity I have, I place at your lotus feet. I humbly pray for your blessings so I may remain steady in my sadhana, grow in devotional service, and cultivate the qualities of humility, gratitude, compassion, and Vaishnava etiquette that you exemplify so effortlessly. Please bless me that I may always remain under your shelter, remembering your teachings and striving to live by them.\n \n Thank you, Maharaj, for allowing insignificant souls like me to receive a drop of your oceanic mercy. This Kartik Yatra has permanently transformed my heart, and I pray that I may always remain connected to your service.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Priya Narayanan"

All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n \n Gurudev, when I look back on my spiritual journey, I realize that your mercy began long before I even understood its value. I still remember that night of year 1999-2000, my elder brother Mathuresh Prabhu took me to catch a glimpse of your darshan at a programme organized at Mafatlal\u0027s Bungalow, Pune. The gathering was huge, and we did not have entry passes. We took a shortcut and climbed on a roadside tree adjacent to the bungalow boundary. For the very first time, I saw you singing harinām kīrtan. Devotees were dancing to the musical rhythms. That moment, though brief, planted a seed of devotion that I could not understand at that time. I only knew one thing: seeing you filled my heart with a kind of peace I had never experienced.\n \n Gurudev, I am unqualified in every way. My heart is still filled with weaknesses and impurities. It is only by your blessings that your pure and sincere devotees are helping me, guiding me, and giving me direction to remain connected to the divine mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda. I am able to submit my offerings to you because of the shelter provided by your compassionate disciples and followers.\n \n Gurudev, during the Govardhan Kartik Yatra of October 2025, hearing your profound realizations that Krishna accepts even the smallest sincere effort, that Giriraj Govardhan is the embodiment of “āśraya-tattva” – the shelter of all devotees, that Govardhan is the greatest servant of Krishna, serving everyone selflessly, that parikrama is not physical exercise but a journey of the heart, that despite being a small boy, Krishna effortlessly lifted Giriraj for seven days, that the lifting of Giriraj is not about strength but about affection – “Krishna can lift mountains, but what pleases Him most is the sincere desire of a devotee’s heart.”\n \n Gurudev, I am having a desire to take harinām-dīkṣā from Your Holiness. I sincerely aspire to grow in chanting, humility, and service. Please bless me so that I may become fit to follow your teachings and serve Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mission with sincerity.\n \n Thank you, Gurudev, for giving meaning to my life from that first darshan in Pune to the profound experiences at Govardhan.\n \n Every step of the journey has been guided by your mercy.\n \n Śrīla Prabhupād Ki Jai!\n \n Your aspiring servant,\n Priya Ranjan Kumar"

While reading I came across a verse from CC Madhya 17.15, where Srila Prabhupada in the purport explains:\n \n “A disciple who has actual love for his spiritual master is endowed, by the blessings of the spiritual master, with all confidential knowledge.”\n \n And upon reading these lines, I reflected, how Srila Prabhupada out of great love for his Spiritual Master HDG Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura, took his instructions to his heart and preached to the people of western countries in the English Language and bestowed us with this gift of International Society of Krishna Consciousness.\n \n If it wasn’t for Srila Prabhupada beginning his travel to the West in 1965, at the age of 69 years, and suffering 2 deadly heart attacks along with seasickness before reaching the shores of America; and later on struggling alone to preach the message of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu while staying in Lower East Side of New York City in its chilling winters, I would not have received this great fortune and benediction to practice Krishna Consciousness.\n \n Adopting this mood, and out of great love for Srila Prabhupada, your Spiritual Master, you have taken up his instructions to your heart and offered your entire life for fulfilling them.\n \n For example, when Srila Prabhupada, during the final days of his earthly pastimes, was having very poor health, and was resting on a bed at Sri Sri Krsna Balarama Mandir, ISKCON Vrindavan. At that time, he gave his instructions to all of us:\n \n “Your love for me,” said Śrīla Prabhupāda, “will be shown by how much you cooperate to keep this institution together after I am gone.”\n \n Taking this instruction to heart, Maharaj, you have lived a life exemplifying how to cooperate with the devotees, how to become a humble and menial servant of all the devotees, and dealing with the devotees with love, and therefore you have always emphasized on developing the qualities of Gratitude, Humility, Tolerance, Selflessness, and rooting out the vices within our heart like False Pride, Arrogance, and False Ego. Maharaj, you have exemplified this in your life, and you are very much pleased with us when we try to serve in the mission of Srila Prabhupada in the same spirit and mood of being Servant of Servant of Servants to the best of our capacities.\n \n Maharaj, you have always cooperated with Srila Prabhupada by encouraging devotees to practice Krishna Consciousness and never leave his shelter. All these years you have taken great care to ensure that the devotees are happy while rendering services. Regarding this, recently your Godsister HG Malati Mataji was sharing -\n \n HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj has kept me inspired to continue practicing Krishna Consciousness despite all struggles in life after Srila Prabhupada had left this world to return back to Godhead.\n \n Inspiring us through your classes, you always sharpened our consciousness and taught us not to serve inattentively and morosely, or doing services offered to us just for the sake of doing them. But you taught us to remain grateful despite all difficulties and reversals that may come while we render services and continue to serve, putting all our heart in it. You are pleased when we take shelter of Krishna and experience joy and happiness in serving Him…\n \n Along with this, you have always taught us to associate with our guru through his Vāṇī, as Srila Prabhupada would often instruct us on numerous occasions:\n \n There are two words, vāṇī and vapuḥ. Vānī means words, and vapuḥ means this physical body. So vāṇī is more important than the vapuḥ. Vapuḥ will be finished.\n \n And even though Maharaj, you met Srila Prabhupada only on a few occasions physically, but you have always associated with him through his Vāṇī, as we have often heard you saying, “Just today morning I was hearing from Srila Prabhupada…” And hearing from Srila Prabhupada, you have taken to your heart many other instructions which were not even given to you personally…\n \n Be it the manifestation of Vrindavan forest on the altar of Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji, or Vrindavan Forest in the courtyard of ISKCON Chowpatty, or ISKCON GEV at Wada, all are manifestations of your surrender and love for the instruction of Srila Prabhupada of developing Vrindavan Forest and 7 temples given back in the 1970s at New Vrindavan!\n \n As I was recently hearing from you during Kartik Yatra, you said:\n \n We can make spiritual advancement and feel a true personal relationship with Srila Prabhupada and our gurus according to how we take his instructions personally — even if they were not given to us in physical proximity, even if they were given to us many years later. Srila Prabhupada was speaking to all of us.\n \n So, although the instructions weren’t given personally to you, but you have taken the instructions of your Guru Maharaj personally out of great love for him and followed them wholeheartedly, and have encouraged and inspired all of us to do the same.\n \n Maharaj, I would love to beg and beg and forever be begging for this one quality of being a Great Lover of our Spiritual Master from you. As Prabhupada explained to us the commentary of Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī on verse SB 1.1.8:\n \n The word snigdhasya means prema-vataḥ. The word prema-vataḥ indicates that one has great love for his spiritual master.\n \n I beg Their Lordships for this love for you, and to become Prema Vatah. Not just for the sake of saying it, but keeping personal comfort and lower nature and desires to enjoy senses aside, allowing this love for you to be manifested in the form of hearing from you daily and taking your instructions personally and following them wholeheartedly.\n \n Maharaj, I beg and desire to remain conscious and attentive in my daily practices of Sadhana chanting and morning program, Sadachar, and Sewa. And be engaged in serving the devotees, serving Srila Prabhupada in the mood of servant of servant of servants, and serving the Lord’s holy name with attention and love, with the mood of being humbler than the blade of grass, tolerant like a tree, and offering all respect to others without expecting any respect for myself. Thus, being always grateful to the grace of Srila Prabhupada because of which I have gotten this opportunity to come to Krishna Consciousness, and to your grace and nectar of your Vāṇī, because of which I am able to sustain.\n \n And Maharaj, in the same spirit that you stated in your Vyas Puja offering to Srila Prabhupada this year, I pray to simply become an instrument of your grace and compassion and serve all living entities who are suffering in this world by taking this sankirtan process very, very seriously in my life.\n \n The world today is suffering from many problems. People, especially the youth, are addicted to so many varieties of things, be it intoxicants like alcohol, opium, and cigarettes, or ignorance in the form of sleep. They have practically surrendered all their consciousness to their mobile phones, watching reels on Instagram, shorts on YouTube.\n \n The youth today is allowing all their good intelligence to be stolen by Maya, by falling prey to easily accessible, explicit, sexual, violent, and stimulating content on social media platforms, especially pornography. Even a moment of youth, when offered to the Lord, is glorified in scriptures, is being slaughtered and presented as an offering on the altar of Maya by Kali.\n \n Maharaj, I simply beg to become an instrument of your grace and compassion, and the compassion of Srila Prabhupada, and to assist my superiors and authorities like HG Radheshyama Prabhuji, HG Gauranga Prabhuji, HG Kanai Thakur Prabhuji, and HG Pankaj Gopa Prabhuji by becoming their servant to preach to the youth and show them the path back to Godhead.\n \n Maharaj, I am an unqualified person, and I am a rascal struggling to deal with these vices myself. I am fallen and addicted to my own lower nature, and I am unworthy of your mercy. Yet, I have a desire to offer my life, just like a little flower with a lifespan of only a few hours, unto your lotus feet.\n \n I pray to you so that I may realize my insignificant position and I humble myself in front of the orders of my superiors and, being submissive and surrendered to them, become an instrument in their hands.\n \n Maharaj, I beg your forgiveness for my shortcomings and sinful activities, knowingly or unknowingly committed, which cause your health to suffer. I promise you that I will overcome these shortcomings by receiving your grace through hearing from you and Srila Prabhupada, and surrendering to your orders and engaging in services with my full capacity.}}\n \n Thank you very much!\n Aspiring to become Servant of Your Servant\n Priyanshu"

        "Your Offering ":  "First of all, koti koti dandwat pranam to Maharaj\u0027s lotus feet.\n I got connected to Iskcon in 2010. First of all through CBD Belapur Iskcon, Mumbai, and later, within six months, I used to run with one mataji for Iskcon Chowpatty temple. I used to finish up my work fast; honestly speaking, I used to make false excuses to my office and go to Iskcon Chowpatty for attending Mangal Aarti. My student\u0027s mother and I both used to plan together, and we used to travel approximately 160 km and adjust with foreigner devotee matajis if a room was not available in a nearby hotel from Chowpatty Iskcon temple. And we used to attend Mangal Aarti; the divine vibes made me visit this temple again and again. The first time I heard about HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj was from the same mataji, my student\u0027s mother, Medha Mataji. And one day, from the Iskcon gift corner, one book attracted me specially, its name \"The Journey Home,\" Autobiography of an American Sadhu. I purchased the book. Once after that, when I was reading that book during traveling, one senior citizen wanted to see that book; he read a few pages and kept reading. Seeing his so much interest, I asked him to keep that copy with him. Again, I purchased one more same book. My brother, who is a voracious reader, took that book from me, and he said that he finished the book in two days. He started feeling vairagya. But said as he is grihasth, he cannot give up his family; he became a devotee visiting Iskcon temple. All the time, in his mouth remains Hare Krishna, and by the mercy of Krishna and Maharaj, he has been initiated. Just reading Maharaj\u0027s book, his autobiography, made my brother a devotee. This is the divine power of Maharaj. Same, I gifted one more book to one more devotee of Iskcon.\n \n And the impact on me is I started reading Shrila Prabhupad\u0027s books more, engaged myself more in book distribution. Gifting Maharaj\u0027s book to my friends and relatives, which impacted their lives. Maharaj is full of love and divinity. When Maharaj speaks, I feel as if love is flowing from him; it is coming to me. Maharaj is so compassionate like a mother. He always asks to forgive others and be humble. These things converted me; I have learned to forgive from Maharaj. My life has changed because of Maharaj. Maharaj\u0027s aura is full of radiance of compassion, love, and divinity. Simply by remembering him, we can feel purity, full of love. On Vyas Puja day, I offer prayers to Shri Shri Radhakunjbihari to bless him with a long, healthy life so that the darkness of crores of people gets enlightened by Maharaj.\n Once again, koti koti dandwat pranam to Maharaj\u0027s lotus feet."

        "Your Offering ":  "I feel that I am so fortunate that I got shelter at the lotus feet of my eternal spiritual master, HH Radhanath Swami Guru Maharaja. Obsessed with material desires, I was trying my best to be happy in this material world. But the more I tried to be happy here, the more frustrated I became. But by the grace of Maharaja, today I know that trying for pleasure in this land of death is like looking for nectar in a poison jar. But just knowing the fact is not sufficient enough to attain salvation. To attain liberation from a miserable life and attain shelter at the lotus feet of Krishna, we have to give up all material attachments and get joyfully attached to the lotus feet of Krishna, who is the source and reservoir of eternal pleasure.\n\nOn our own, to attain that state is an impossible task, but if we get the shelter of the lotus feet of pure devotees of Krishna, then crossing over the ocean of material miseries becomes very easy. Even Prahlada Maharaja says that the only way by which we can free ourselves from the clutches of material attachments is by bathing in the dust of the lotus feet of a devotee of Krishna.\n\nWe are fortunate that we have got an opportunity to take shelter of the dust of the lotus feet of HH Radhanath Swami Guru Maharaja, who is so fully absorbed in chanting and sharing the glories of Krishna constantly.\n\nJust like the bright rays of the sun dissipate darkness, similarly, Maharaja illuminates the heart of unfortunate souls like me, who are engulfed in the darkness of ignorance. When we hear the glories of Krishna from the lotus mouth of Maharaja, then our heart, which mostly cries in pain because of material obsession, begins dancing in joy.\n\nMaharaja dedicated his life at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, and as per the desire and instruction of Prabhupada, he has been spending every moment of his life in spreading Krishna Consciousness all over the world. Maharaja’s dedication to Krishna Consciousness is unprecedented, his glories are unlimited, and his determination is unparalleled.\n\nOn his 75th Vyasa Puja, I would like to share a few glories of Maharaja which are so inspiring.\n\nExperiencing joy in sharing Krishna Katha - Whenever I hear any lecture of Maharaja, I see that he speaks about Krishna from the core of his heart. He speaks for hours with great enthusiasm and energy. Sometimes, when he shares the pastimes of the Lord, it seems that he has been part of all those pastimes. During the recent Kartik Yatra in Govardhan, he spoke for hours about Krishna’s Govardhan lila. Maharaja spoke in such detail about the different places of Govardhan Parikrama that all of us who were hearing him did parikrama of Govardhan again and again just by hearing it from the lotus mouth of Maharaja.\n\nThe brajvasis lived with Krishna in Vrindavan 5000 years ago and enjoyed various pastimes with Krishna. By the grace of Maharaja, we got an opportunity to relish those inconceivable pastimes of Krishna sitting near Giriraj Govardhan this Kartik Yatra.\n\nJust as Maharaja enjoys sharing pastimes of Krishna constantly, I pray to him for his mercy so that I develop a taste for constantly relishing Krishna katha.\n\nInspiring devotees to give up sense gratification: The goal of life is to give up material sense gratification and engage our senses in the service of Krishna. But we know that our senses have become so addicted to sense gratification that, in spite of us doing our best, we fail to give up the enjoying mentality. Scriptures say that only by the mercy of great souls, we will get the determination and ability to shun material enjoyment. In my experience, every morning when I get up, I take a vow not to indulge in sense gratification, but as the day passes, I find how difficult it is to say no to the demands of the mind and senses. In spite of knowing the danger of sense indulgence, I fail to give it up.\n\nBut at least during Kartik Yatra, I see that I get some strength to stay away from sense gratification. When I sit with hundreds of devotees hearing Maharaj’s katha, I experience how wonderful it is to engage senses in hearing the pastimes of Krishna.\n\nMaharaja mercifully is teaching me how to shun sense gratification and indulge completely in the service of Krishna. By doing so, one day I will become eligible to go back to Godhead and live with Krishna and his wonderful devotees in his abode.\n\nTeaching us to remember Srila Prabhupada: During the Govardhan Kartik yatra, we celebrated the 129th disappearance day of Srila Prabhupada in the pandal. Maharaj organized the program in such a wonderful way that we got an opportunity to hear wonderful glories of Prabhupada and important lessons which Prabhupada teaches us.\n\nDevotees were so inspired to serve Prabhupada as per the guidelines of Maharaja that they cooked several bhoga items for Prabhupada. Maharaj, in one of the classes, said that there were 300 bhoga items which were offered to Prabhupada. We offered Pushpanjali to Prabhupada at noon, and there was guru puja followed by prasadam.\n\nIn the evening, Maharaj so beautifully sang – je anilo prem dhan. We all got so immersed in the song that we felt separation from Srila Prabhupada. Although physically I have never got the opportunity to take darshan of Prabhupada, but I am able to see him through Maharaja.\nSeeing Maharaj’s dedication for Srila Prabhupada was so inspirational. We also learnt how our life should be dedicated to Srila Prabhupada and how we should be enthusiastically serving his mission.\n\nBinding devotees together with love: One of the biggest challenges which people face in the world is their inability to get along with each other. Even in a small family, we see disputes, quarrels, heartbreaks, and complaints.\n\nBut it is amazing to see how during every Kartik Yatra, more than 10,000 devotees from different parts of the world stay together united for more than a week. There is no quarrel, disagreement, chaos, heartburns, and complaints. Everyone respects others and tries to help others.\n\nEven if there are some challenges and difficulties, still devotees, understanding the circumstances, do not become disheartened and dissatisfied. It is because they know the purpose for which they have gathered.\n\nAnd most importantly, the joy all gets in associating with Maharaj makes all difficulties and challenges appear insignificant. When the heart gets flooded with Maharaj’s nectarean lectures and melodious kirtan, then all material pains just disappear.\n\nTeaching us how to see all spiritual masters with equal vision: Maharaj teaches by his own example how we should deal with the disciples of Srila Prabhupada, the present spiritual masters in ISKCON, and all the devotees who are connected with ISKCON.\nMaharaja showers great love and respect especially upon his godbrothers and godsisters. This is why we see so many of his godbrothers and godsisters come during Maharaj’s Kartik Yatra year after year. We also get an opportunity to hear from them their personal realizations and their experience of dealing with Srila Prabhupada. Maharaj teaches us that we should not be guru fanatic. We should see all spiritual masters with equal vision and should have utmost respect for them.\n\nMaharaj’s glories are unlimited, but I am trying to share a few of those for my personal purification. On Maharaja’s 75th Vyasa Puja, I pray at the divine feet of Sri Sri Radha Govinda, Lord Jagannath, Baladeva, and Subhadra Maharani, Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga, and Srila Prabhupada to give me determination so that I follow the footsteps of Maharaja and never leave his lotus feet. I also beg at the lotus feet of Maharaja to shower his mercy upon me so that I develop distaste for sense gratification and develop taste in hearing and sharing the glories of Krishna.\n\nHH Radhanath Swami Guru Maharaj’s eternal servant\nPurushottam Nitai Das\nISKCON Newtown, Kolkata, India"

Please accept mental pushpabhisekam with millions of flower petals at your lotus feet!! All glories to dear Srila Prabhupada and to you dear Gurudev, his loving representative!\n \n On your auspicious 75th Vyāsa-pūjā, I offer my heartfelt prayers. May Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu grant you long life, strength, and unimpeded service so you may continue to illuminate the world with your vapu and vāṇī, which are rays of Śrī Nityānanda’s mercy.\n \n Your presence at this year’s Sadhu-saṅga Retreat in Orlando was a turning point in my spiritual life. Although surrounded by hundreds of devotees, you mercifully answered the questions that had troubled my heart since my initiation in 2019—questions about service, spiritual direction, and whom I should look to as guiding ācāryas etc. With such compassion, you clarified that my goal should be to become a servant of the servant, and you spoke so beautifully about the life and mood of Śrīla Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī. Even without a personal meeting, your words and background pictures on the stage reached directly into my heart. I am forever grateful for this mercy.\n \n Trying to follow your instructions, I have begun adding services that may nourish my bhakti. I joined the Sanskrit meters class taught by HG Amarendra Prabhu. Though I am not a singer, I feel that whatever I learn now is a preparation for future life. I do feel this aligns with your instructions even though I cannot fully understand now. I also plan to join the Bhakti-Vaibhava course offered at our local temple, and I pray for your blessings to imbibe the mood of a sincere listener and follower of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\n \n To make space for these devotional efforts, I stepped back from the advanced accounting course I had been considering. I hope this decision aligns with your desire and pleases you.\n \n This year also brought profound personal change. My dear father left this world in June at the age of 76. After enduring cancer and tuberculosis, and after great physical suffering, I firmly believe that by his piety, charity, compassionate nature, and constant hearing of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Hare Kṛṣṇa tape, he attained the Lord’s mercy and went back home. Even though he did not chant on beads, his ears and heart were chanting. When the electricity went out, he asked my mother to continue the recording in any way possible. A week before his departure, the Lord appeared to my mother in a dream, saying He was pleased with my father and would take him back soon without further suffering—and so it happened.\n \n Remembering your teachings and your lotus feet gave me immense solace during this time. Though losing a parent can make one feel orphaned, I knew that you, Gurudev, are always present, always sheltering your disciples through your mercy, your prayers, and your instructions. Thank you Guru Maharaja for being there for us!\n \n I am the useless and unqualified daughter of two great, pious souls who tolerated my shortcomings endlessly. Similarly, I am totally undeserving of the ocean of compassion, attention, and encouragement you give me. Sometimes I feel that if you kicked me in the head, that would be a better utilization of your time.\n \n I deeply appreciate your extraordinary discipline, your control of senses, and your meticulous care for your health—all for the purpose of serving Śrīla Prabhupāda and spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Your dedication inspires us all. Dear Guru Mahārāja, you mean more to us than words can express. We pray that you remain with us, guiding us, blessing us, and uplifting us for many, many years.\n \n Wishing you unlimited divine health, blissful preaching, and the constant association of loving devotees.\n \n Your utterly useless daughter,\n Pushpanjali dasi\n Austin, TX"

And even we know this, but for Maharaj, it is totally ingrained in him, and how he always thinks so much before responding. And we tend to just react. He is so thoughtful of every aspect before speaking with so much calm and depth.\nOn this auspicious occasion of the 75th appearance day of Maharaj, I wish to seek his blessings to be able to learn and try to cultivate this one quality of being able to speak to whoever I be with love and compassion, to respond and not react, to be a good listener, to believe and behave knowing everything connected to Krishna is conscious and thus to please Him, Prabhupada, and Krishna.\nI also pray for good health for Maharaj and that I may be able to serve Maharaj, Mahaprabhu, and Radha Gopinath Ji eternally.\nThank you\nYour most humble servant\nRaas Purnima devi dasi"

I pray for strength, enthusiasm, humility, tolerance, Vaishnava seva, and the opportunity to distribute transcendental literature.\n\nEach one of us considers ourselves fortunate to receive your mercy and association in our lives. Whenever I face challenges, I try to listen to your lectures or read your books like The Journey Home.\n\nYour teachings are filled with divine wisdom, guiding us to find the best Krishna-conscious solutions in any situation. On this auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, I offer my heartfelt gratitude to my spiritual master, His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of our spiritual masters, Maharaj has dedicated his life to helping people discover the inner wealth that brings true happiness. And that inner treasure can only be attained when we connect with the lotus feet of Krishna.\n\nMaharaj repeatedly emphasizes in his lectures that real happiness is not found in the external world but within ourselves. Maharaj says:\n\"\"Unless a person is happy within his own heart, no matter what he achieves, he cannot be truly happy.\"\"\n\nThe real treasure lies within us. Unfortunately, we have forgotten it. But once we rediscover it, we will never be unhappy again.\n\nSadly, even after coming to Krishna consciousness and practicing for years, we sometimes fail to experience that inner joy. This is why unfortunate situations arise where devotees struggle to harmonize with each other—whether in the community or within families.\n\nWhen we feel unfulfilled inside, we try to satisfy ourselves through external means—by accumulating wealth, material comforts, power, positions, fame, and recognition. But these cannot give us lasting happiness. In fact, they often become sources of suffering. No external method can ever satisfy the heart.\n\nIf we are joyful within, we will always remain content and spread happiness everywhere.\n\nOn this auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, I offer my heartfelt gratitude to my spiritual master, His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj, for blessing me with the wealth of Krishna consciousness. I pray at your lotus feet for intelligence and determination to always follow your instructions and serve Krishna according to your desires, so that my human life becomes truly successful. \n\nYour insignificant servant,\nRadhageeta Devi Dasi Nasik\""

So, at this point, I beg you to keep us inspired through your lectures and pray to Lord Krishna and Srimati Radharani to bless you with a long and healthy life.\n Your servant,\n Radhamahima dd"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Maharaj\n Hare Krishna\n Special Dandavats on your 75th appearance day\n All glories to Sri Guru and Gauranga\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada\n \n It is a great fortune to offer love and gratitude to you on your appearance day - Vyas Puja day.\n \n I pray at your feet that the parampara please guide me to glorify you in the proper manner.\n \n On listening to HG Vishakha Mataji about your honouring of materially stale prasad with repeated servings:\n Immediately I remembered about a sadhu in Vrindavan who advised his disciple to stay in Vrindavan only when he can taste the love and mercy of Krishna in the prasad in place of various masalas. You showed how you relished the taste of Krishna\u0027s mercy in that prasad.\n The other thought that came to mind was that of Srila Raghunath Das Goswami. Even he honoured Jagannath Prasad that was rejected even by the cows. Dear Gurudev, please bless that some day I can associate with Vaishnavas who have such developed consciousness and someday get such a taste.\n Ego fails me to realize it.\n \n You have surely surpassed such a barrier of ego. When HG Rishikumar Prabhu mentioned of you offering respects to him, it was a jolt to my ego. You exemplified how we should be humble. Please bless to get the attitude some day.\n \n A devotee explained to not have ego and attachments should be given up as on death we are given a dress that has no pockets to take any of the accumulated wealth.\n Gurudev, you have already given up your attachment to any such accumulation. You mention how you have no bank account nor have you signed any cheque. Such an example to follow. Please bless to follow those who are following you.\n We have not seen Srila Prabhupada. You are a true representative and like a mirror image of his qualities that makes me feel like experiencing Srila Prabhupada. Vrindavan was and is so dear to Srila Prabhupada, but he left that loving place just to fulfill the order of his spiritual master Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Swami Prabhupada. Similarly even you love Vrindavan so much but on order of Srila Prabhupada you served at New Vrindavan.\n \n Dear Gurudev, you and your Godbrothers resonate the qualities mentioned in every paragraph of the scriptures. While reading, you are naturally remembered. You all are The Moons of Srila Prabhupada.\n \n On listening to how you personally serve not just your Godbrothers but also other guests, we cannot stop adoring your concern and care and love for others. You show how you cater to details as a sign of your love.\n As HH Sacchinandan Maharaj had mentioned about your concern even for the beggars. So much compassion. As Srila Prabhupada says that love for Krishna is the natural tendency of us, but we have fallen prey to the contaminations of the material world. You have that natural love for Krishna and the devotees.\n \n HG Gopinath Prabhu mentioned of the counselor system developed by you. How good is the foundation of this system. Gurudev, you have toiled a lot to get this system in place. Your patience and enthusiasm only made it possible. It\u0027s only the greatness of parampara that has manifested through you.\n \n You once tried to tame my ego but I am so unfortunate to not take that instruction in the right manner.\n On this auspicious day, I beg forgiveness for my offenses unto you, your near and dear ones, and Srila Prabhupada.\n Your glories do not stop here, but please allow me to conclude this offering here.\n \n Please bless that I serve ISKCON - the very body of Srila Prabhupada.\n Please allow me to offer my respects to all the authentic Gurus through you.\n \n Trying to be a servant\n Yours\n Radhanath Krishna das"

A happiest 75th Vyas Puja Maharaja!\nDear Guru Maharaja, as I sit to write down this year\u0027s Vyas Puja offering for the pleasure of Your Holiness, I\u0027m overwhelmed with the countless memories, reciprocations, and blessings that you\u0027ve showered in my life. As I look back, I find that you were always there, arranging the situations in the best possible way to develop my Krishna Consciousness.\n You have been the embodiment of Guru Nishtha throughout your life through your body, mind, and words. The entire ISKCON knows and titles you as \"the real sadhu\". The qualities of pure devotional service unto Guru and Krishna, as spoken by the words of shastras and acharyas, are perfectly exemplified by you. Be it the padayatras, book distributions, sankirtan, management, leadership, devotee care, centennial, and countless such projects and responsibilities. Your glories are unlimited, oh dear Gurudev!\n If I talk about me, you have nonetheless picked me up from a random pit of dirt and abominable things and placed me in the care of HG Raghu Nath Das Prabhu and HG Raspriya Mataji. I can see my prayers have been answered—might or might not be by Krishna, but definitely by you, Gurudev.

Similarly, only if you mercifully give me your shelter can I serve rightly. What can I do to make your Appearance Day special from my side? The only thing I realized which pleases you most is when you see Srila Prabhupada\u0027s movement spreading throughout.\n I am in need of your blessings, Guru Maharaja, to serve efficiently in this lifetime. As I always pray, please always engage me in your service through my Shiksha Gurus, under their guidance. Only by the service opportunities they have provided me with have I gained the chance to write this Vyas puja offering.

But the first time I took your darshan was in your vyas puja at Crossroad Maidan. That day only I totally accepted you as my spiritual master. When she asked me to read your \"Journey Home\" book, it was like it transformed my thoughts and life into Radhanath Swami consciousness.\n \n Guru Maharaj, you are the lighthouse for me in traveling this dukhalayam, bhav sagar.\n Guru Maharaj, you are so compassionate; that\u0027s why you accept me as your servant of servants. Thank you, Guru Maharaj!\n \n I heard and read in books that diksha is what binds us, Guru and shishya, in one link to the parampara, but I realized it in many ways and so many times.\n One incident I want to share with you is that a few years back, our family faced a very financial crisis due to me. My prabhuji were jobless, suddenly. It was a too difficult time. We were serving Shri Jaganathji, Baldevji, and Subhadra Mai at home; the kids were small; their school, rented house... so many things! Two months went by like this. I heard in classes, read in books, \"no prayer for material things,\" so I never did the same.\n \n But one day, when I received the result of my unsuccessful attempt at a competitive exam, I was totally disappointed and literally crying in front of Shri Jagannath Ji, not asking for anything, but crying. That night while sleeping, I prayed to you and asked for forgiveness for crying in front of Lord Krishna and requested you to please give me strength to tolerate the situation and please suggest me how I can overcome the situation. Please give me a ray of hope! And I slept. When I woke up in brahma muhurta, doing regular activities before starting japa, I prayed to you. Suddenly, one thought struck me: \"Why am I searching for a job? Why not start our own coaching classes?\" as I am a lecturer in college. With that thought, I completed my japa and shared this thought with my family. Everyone felt, \"How can you start it? We don\u0027t have anything.\" But because of your mercy, we got help and started our own Bhaktivedanta classes for Class 5th to 10th, and 25 students joined our class within a month. My prabhuji and I both were teaching in the class.\n \n It\u0027s all your mercy, Guru Maharaj!\n I can able to realize your presence in our life and surroundings. Devotees said that females can\u0027t serve Guru Maharaj, but your vanni seva is everything for us, Guru Maharaj!\n \n Please, please, Guru Maharaj, keep us in your seva and under your shelter always!\n Bless us with dasanu das bhav to continue to serve you and your devotees in Srila Prabhupada\u0027s mission!"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna, please accept my humble obeisances unto Your lotus feet.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n You are the most merciful and kind-hearted person in the universe, as You have accepted this most fallen soul as Your servant. For that, I am very grateful to You forever and ever.\n Your heart is always in Vrindavan mora mana vrindavan vrindavan paritajayam padam ekam no gachati, but for delivering fallen souls like me, You travel all over the globe to preach, leaving the bhaumya Vrindavan, which is the place You want to reside near the Yamuna bank under the kadamba tree.\n You have an ocean of qualities, Gurudev. I like Your lectures, kirtans, talks, and etc., very much, without which I think I will not be able to survive.\n Dear Gurudev, You have filled all my desires by giving me Your precious time, love, and blessings, not only upon me but unto my whole family. By visiting my house twice, You have converted my house to Vrindavan by placing Your footsteps in our humble house, which was like a dream come true.\n Dear Gurudev, You are an ocean of mercy, and this day I pray unto the lotus feet of Lord Jagannath Swami to give You a healthy long life so that You can continue to inspire and preach the message of Sriman Mahaprabhu and Srila Prabhupada, who just by seeing You, recognized You and called You to the stage and accepted You.\n Thank you so much for opening Your heart by giving Your autobiography in the form of The Journey Home, which is the best storybook I have ever read in my life.\n I always remember Your teachings, especially that \"Love people not things,\" \"there is a good dog and bad dog, feed the good one,\" \"don\u0027t give your remote to others.\"\n Like the way You dance is just like Mahaprabhu danced, and I love the way You have created it and fulfilled the desire of Your Guru Maharaj Ji. You have followed all the instructions of Your Guru Maharaj, and the respect and love which You have for Your Godbrothers and their disciples is amazing and mesmerizing.\n I like Your yatras, which recharges all Your disciples worldwide. They are above the world; it is like staying in Goloka.\n Your love and care for cows is awesome.\n I can write and write so many things about You throughout my life, but I cannot complete describing Your gunas, qualities, and glories, as You are a Goloka ma, and I am an insignificant person. What can I describe about You through my material senses?\n You are like a diamond, which is formed under most pressure under the coal. Like that, You have day and night given Your every breath in the service of Guru and Gauranga. You have given up Your sleep, and day and night You have served in New Vrindavan, bathed by rubbing ice in the freezing chilling winters, and cooked food by using wet woods which gave only smoke, doing Seva day and night preparing the six offerings and six aartis, taking bath again and again, then whole night doing kirtan, then college preaching, then given sanyas and sent to Mumbai. And You are like a real touchstone, a parasmani, whoever came in contact with You became a devotee. All the doctors, engineers, MBAs, businessmen, You made every one a pure devotee.\n Your temple Chowpatty is a world-famous community in the history of ISKCON. Devotees all around the world follow the way You preach. Prasad distribution, Sunday feast, yatras, book distribution, the hospital You have opened are all top of the world.\n Yet, You are so humble, grateful, full of gratitude, as You teach that a real great person can be judged when he has everything, and yet he is humble. I like this line so much: \"Hate the sin, not the sinner.\"\n You are so detached that You don\u0027t have a bank account also.\n Your love for reading shastras and Prabhupada\u0027s books is amazing, and Your kathas are as if we are seeing all the pastimes through our eyes just by hearing from You, as if the pastimes are taking place in front of our eyes, and just by hearing, our hearts get purified.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Raga Jagannath Das"

Mercifully, please accept this.\nGuru Maharaj, on the auspicious day of your Vyas Puja, I was just meditating on the causeless mercy which I received from you without any of my personal qualification. I am so fallen \u0026 mad that I don\u0027t understand the value of what I have received. Guru Maharaj ji, in spite of knowing my so fallen condition, You have showered your causeless mercy upon me; that shows what a great level of compassion You have for us. You are the torchlight of knowledge to show the right path in this darkest material world for me \u0026 millions of others. You have such a deep love for Their Lordships, Srila Prabhupada, \u0026 for all living entities; it\u0027s the greatest hope for me \u0026 millions, trillions of living entities. You have given perfect pearls of divine instructions through your divine discourses, but in spite of knowing it, I am miserably failing to follow your instructions due to lack of my sincerity \u0026 lack of determination. So, Guru Maharaj ji, I beg strength \u0026 intelligence to understand \u0026 follow your divine instructions in my life to please you using body, mind, words, \u0026 all resources in serving Hari, Guru \u0026 Vaishnavas. You are the crest jewel \u0026 epitome of all devotion \u0026 compassion. Please bless me with selfless \u0026 pure love for you \u0026 also please bless me to make your instructions the life \u0026 soul of my life. Also, Guru Maharaj ji, I am offending holy names, the ultimate saviour, so please give me strength to chant lovingly, attentively, sincerely, devotionally, respectfully in the mood of a servant of servants of your servants. Guru Maharaj ji, as you say, detail in every aspect is a sign of love, so from Kartik Yatra arrangements, your oceanic love manifests for us in so much detail. You \u0026 the whole Yatra committee put numerous efforts to give a pleasurable enlightenment in the dham. Also, Guru Maharaj ji, how you have manifested Sri Vrindavan Dham in GEV with so minute details is very inspiring \u0026 adorable. This only a true empowered acharya like you can do. Your dealings with each \u0026 every Brajavasi \u0026 your God brothers is a manifestation of your selfless love \u0026 humble service attitude towards them. You are the personification of the Trinad api sunichena verse; please bless me so that I can also follow this verse for your pleasure only. Your entire divine life is full of simplicity, divinity, compassion, servitude, \u0026 selfless highest degree of love for Their Lordships \u0026 their associates. I don\u0027t have any intelligence \u0026 capacity to understand your unlimited glories, but still, I did a childish attempt to glorify you, to seek your blessings \u0026 prayers by the instructions of your representatives for your pleasure, so please, please mercifully accept this offering unto your lotus feet.\n\nVery Insignificant aspiring servant of your servants,\nRaghav Chaitanya Das"

Before I came across Maharaj, my understanding of spirituality was very shallow — it was just an idea, not a way of life. But through his words, his humility, and his love, I started to see what true spirituality really is — service, compassion, and connection with Krishna.\n There have been so many moments when I felt lost or weak in my spiritual journey, but just listening to Maharaj’s lectures or reading The Journey Home gave me strength again. It’s like his words have the power to touch the soul and remind you of your real purpose.\n Maharaj doesn’t just speak philosophy — he lives it. His kindness, his patience, his genuine care for every soul — all of it inspires me every single day to try to become a better person and a better devotee.\n I feel deeply grateful to have come in touch with such a pure soul. I pray that I can always remember his teachings and try to follow in his footsteps — to serve with humility, love, and gratitude.\n Currently, I\u0027m studying, and when I listen to Maharaj’s lectures, I get so much motivation in study. Thank you. Hare Krishna.\n All glories to HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj. 🙇🏻"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n This year has been very divinely blessed for me as I received your personal association for the longest period I believe. Two times in Boston, apart from the initiation lecture at Bhakti Center and Kartik Yatra at Govardhan.\n \n I am truly indebted for your teachings and personal example for standing like a strong pillar of Pure Devotional Service and pure love, which has the cement and concrete of the mood of servant of servant of servant, and is founded on the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, especially trinadapi sunicena taror api sahishnuna amanina mana dena kirtaniya sada harih.\n \n Maharaj, as you have instructed HG RSP for preaching in USA, especially to develop youth preaching in Boston, and HG RSP has sent both of us here to execute your will. I feel utterly unqualified and incapable. But I really want to try, following in the footsteps of Srila Prabhupada, Yourself, and HG RSP. I truly lack Vaishnava qualities and the mood of a servant; I am not able to call out holy names sincerely from the heart either. Please, Maharaj, give me strength to be able to take shelter of Guru and Gauranga, holy names truly, and put my whole heart, life, and soul to endeavor here to serve your will. Please make my heart free from false egotism, envy, and hatred for any Vaishnava. I am helpless but begging you to please bestow upon me sincere and genuine respect and affection for all the Vaishnavas and an attitude and consciousness to honor them from the heart and not get trapped by Kali in developing feelings of enmity towards any Vaishnava. I really need your mercy and strength for that.\n \n Also, please bless me that I don\u0027t get trapped by the greatest agent of Maya, the mind, and remain truly grateful towards all my superiors without feeling any kind of injustice to me or any unfavorable thing which blocks my heart from being truly grateful and honoring and worshipping all my superiors.\n \n I have been trying to read SP daily at least one hour, and by your mercy, it\u0027s happening for a few months now. I wish to continue this for all my life and am seeking your mercy for that. I wish to also hear your lecture daily at least 30 minutes and SP at least 30 minutes with great attention and eagerness to transform my heart. Also, I beg for the strength to consciously avoid Maya and run towards Krishna and not get trapped by desire for name, fame, honor, etc., and truly engage in service with the simple mood of servant of servant of servant.\n \n Guru Maharaj, please navigate my life; it\u0027s in your hand. I sincerely want to become a surrendered soul, transformed and purified to be used in the service of the Lord for Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas eternally. Please give me strength to be able to withstand all odds, no matter what, with determination in executing your will.\n \n I wish to always remain faithful to Guru and Krishna and truly serve and please you.\n Your insignificant beggar and servant,\n Raghava Kripa Das"

Specially my heart was moved so much when I was reading the part when you came to Vrindavan, how you got the association of Ghanshyam baba and the inspiration you received from his life. \nMaharaj, before reading this book, I did not know anything about Guru and disciple relationship. After completing the book, I felt that if there is a Guru in my life, that should be you only Maharaj. \n\nMaharaj, through your Vani association, I learnt many things, especially your compassion. How you show compassion on every living being inspired me so much. \nI sincerely beg you Maharaj, to give me an opportunity to learn that compassion from you. \n\nMaharaj, I have been waiting for 3 years to get your association. I am very grateful to you for your’s and Krishna’s mercy, I got the opportunity to participate in this year’s Kartik Yatra. \n\nWhatever services I am rendering to ISKCON, namely Book reading session service and Japa session service, they are possible only by your mercy and Srila Prabhupada’s and Krishna’s mercy.\n\nI am very grateful to you Maharaj. \nMaharaj, even though I am doing services and reading books, I am not getting the taste in chanting. I beg you Maharaj to give me the taste of chanting and sincere service attitude.

First, your absorption in Krishna – chanting His holy name, speaking about Krishna, doing kirtan, or cooking for Krishna on the occasion of Govardhan puja in Kartik Yatras or Srila Prabhupada’s disappearance days. And second is your broad-mindedness in serving Krishna and spreading the mission of Lord Chaitanya far \u0026 wide.\nYou repeatedly instruct me to always do all the services in great absorption, seriousness \u0026 sincerity. You not only just instruct me but personally demonstrate how to do Japa attentively by personally coming for chanting with devotees in the temple hall or in the Pandal during Kartik Yatras. From a material viewpoint, your physical body is quite old 75 years age, but still, you sit on the ground near Tulasi Maharani with your back straight and chant the holy name with great eagerness \u0026 attention. This is very instructive to me. How I also should increase my eagerness \u0026 concentration in Japa. While speaking Krishna Katha, you always maintain the balance of narrating the pastimes with great details at the same time giving lessons at appropriate times with appropriate stories or day-to-day examples. You become so much absorbed while giving a lecture by your sitting posture with a straight back \u0026 not even drinking water for hours together.\nRegarding the second quality of being broad-minded in spreading Lord Chaitanya’s movement. Although you are always focused on reaching new people through various outreach programs, you also have a keen concern for maintaining the spiritual \u0026 devotional aspects in cooking for all the devotees I heard that you personally taste \u0026 check all the preparations, attending to the needs of Varishtha Vaishnavas, children, matajis, grihasthas, brahmacharies, foreign-bodied devotees, other sampradaya devotees \u0026 maintaining the cleanliness of the premises where our programs are held. You personally visit all the departments and supervise \u0026 give instructions for improvement in a gentle and non-pressurizing way but a persuasive way. You are also a silent fundraiser. Without applying pressure on your disciples, you inspire them to donate voluntarily and happily.\nI pray at your lotus feet that may I imbibe these qualities more in my personal life and come up to the standard which you expect from your ideal disciple to exhibit.\nYour unworthy disciple,\nRam Nitai Das, ISKCON NVCC, Pune."

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna dear Guru Maharaj,\n  Please accept our humble obeisances at your lotus feet. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. On this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa-puja, we offer this small and heartfelt glorification from our family—Rama Mukunda Dasa, Radhika Lila Devi Dasi, Tulasi Gopika Devi Dasi and Tulasi. We pray that these few words may express even a drop of our gratitude for your mercy.\n Guru Maharaj, there is no joy in this world like the joy of seeing you and hearing from you in person. When you stand before us, something sacred fills the atmosphere. There is a sweetness, a purity, almost a magic in the air that cannot be explained. To receive your darshan in one’s own hometown, in one’s own temple, is a very special blessing from the Lordships. All of us in Seattle felt truly fortunate and deeply grateful when you kindly visited us from the 19th to the 22nd of May, 2025. Those days were filled with happiness as we watched you lovingly greet every devotee, blessing each person with your gentle smile and compassionate glance. Your presence brought so much warmth and encouragement; it felt as if mercy was flowing continuously.\n In your presence, faith becomes natural, devotion becomes joyful, and the heart becomes soft. You are the reservoir of all that is sweet, gentle, humble, and pure. You accept everyone without judgment. You see the good in every soul, and not only see it—you magnify it. You are filled with gratitude for everything and everyone. Even though you are so exalted, your shyness, your innocence, and your simplicity remind us of a child, while at the same time, your determination, courage, and spiritual gravity are like a thunderbolt. You are a true sadhu. Though deeply austere and inwardly strong, you always depend solely on Krishna through prayer and surrender. You avoid taking service from others, yet you are always eager to serve. Your life has been an extraordinary journey—filled with freedom, adventure, pain, and joy—but through every season, you have only listened to the voice of Paramatma in your heart.\n Your compassion is vast and practical. Whether through Govardhan Ecovillage, Annakshetra, Barsana eye camps, or countless other efforts, you show what true spiritual love looks like. You never give importance to external designations like background, race, or religion. You simply see a soul—part and parcel of Krishna. You live only to fulfill Srila Prabhupada’s dreams and the mission of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. You unite hearts. You teach us to value relationships over achievements, people over projects, affection over ego. You never involve yourself in anything that could disturb the unity Srila Prabhupada desired in his movement. You only inspire cooperation, care, and mutual respect.\n Your hari-katha is the treasure of our lives. It has the power to purify and uplift the entire universe. For us, it is the source of our greatest joy. Even when you speak about tolerance, you never emphasize your own. Yet we have heard that your life has been filled with pain, and still you never allow it to touch others. Instead, you show only kindness. Your deep humility, your devotion to Gauranga Mahaprabhu, and your unwavering remembrance of Srila Prabhupada shine through every word and action.\n On this sacred Vyasa-puja day, Guru Maharaj, we pray at your lotus feet for just one blessing—that every step we take, every word we speak, and every thought we allow into our mind may be guided by your gentle voice and your teachings. May we serve in a way that brings a little happiness to your heart and contributes, even in a small way, to the mission you hold so dear.\n We offer our heartfelt prayers to Sri Sri Radha Neel-Madhava to kindly keep you always in the best health, filled with divine strength, and always in sweet remembrance of your beloved spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada. Thank you, Guru Maharaj, for your presence, your compassion, and your unconditional love.\n Your insignificant servants,\n Rama Mukunda Dasa\n Radhika Lila Devi Dasi\n Tulasi Gopika Devi Dasi\n Tulasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Respected Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my prostrated obeisances at your lotus\n feet. On this most auspicious occasion of your 75 th Vyas Puja day I feel gratitude filling in\n heart for all the mercy you have bestowed in my life. Gradually, I am realizing increasingly\n how you have been always present in my life especially at difficulties and helped me\n continue the path of Krishna consciousness in the association of devotees.\n In Srimad Bhagavatam Mother Devahuti prays to Lord Kapila:--\n tasya tvaà tamaso \u0026#39;ndhasya\n duñpärasyädya päragam\n sac-cakñur janmanäm ante\n labdhaà me tvad-anugrahät\n Translation: --“Your Lordship is my only means of getting out of this darkest region of\n ignorance because You are my transcendental eye, which, by Your mercy only, I have\n attained after many, many births.”\n And Srila Prabhupada Writes in purport: --\u0026quot; By the instruction of the spiritual master, the\n darkness of ignorance is removed, and thus the disciple is enabled to go to the side of\n freedom.”.\n Similarly in the next verse Srila Prabhupada writes: --\u0026quot; Similarly, without the light of the\n Supreme Lord, or without the divine grace of the spiritual master, one cannot see things as\n they are.”\n It has been indeed your Vani which caused great attraction in my heart to take shelter of\n your holy lotus feet and take to Krishna consciousness seriously by joining brahmacari\n ashram. Your Vani is like very powerful sun which lights up the contaminated region of my\n heart and shows me the path back to Supreme Lord.\n I remember when I was in Kolkata back in 2014, as usual I was confused with so many\n things going on in my life and even about some things I saw in association of devotees, and I\n has asked in a long letter so many questions to one of your senior disciples. Later when you\n came to Kolkata you had lectured on the section of Indra offends Brihaspati and you said\n how when one offends spiritual master then the sad ripus take over the mind and sense s.\n In a similar enlightening but deeply touching and yet illuminating note you said:” Even if one\n drops atom bomb on your head, you will remain the servant of Krishna”.\n This formed a deep samskara in my heart and the question of relationship of Jiva with\n supreme Lord became crystal clear. Until then I had superficial understanding of how the\n Jiva is a servant of servant Of lord but ten when I started reading Bhagavad git ai discovered\n so many sections where Srila Prabhupada emphasized the same point. Everywhere I read in\n SP books I found the same line.\n In those times when you had visited Kolkata and gave that lecture, I was reading The\n Bhagavad Gita 2 nd chapter that time and I found so many lines where SP emphasized it: --\n For example, in BG 2.55 he wrote: --\u0026quot; The highly developed soul always remains satisfied in\n himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord. Such a\n transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism;\n rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme\n Lord.”.\n And in BG 2.66 SP writes” Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with\n Krishna is certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much he may make a\n show of peace and spiritual advancement in life. Krishna consciousness is a self-manifested\n peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with Kåishna.”\n It was then I started to deeply reflect on the sambandha of the souls with the Lord which was\n covered over by so many doubts, delusions and distractions.\n I could see how you were impacting on my consciousness at the relationship of soul and\n Krishna in my life not juts theoretically but at a consciousness level. Till then thinking of\n myself to become a servant of others I theoretically accepted but on practical level I thought\n of better options otherwise.\n Thus, not only have you clarified my Deep-seated doubts, but you have nourished my soul,\n protected my bhakti and preserved me in the association of devotees.\n Later in 2022 when my mother was ill and I had to attend her, almost every day I found a\n miracle, I could see your presence in my life, how you were working to uplift me by giving me\n visions of Krishna’s arrangement and your blessings in my life. And in those periods the\n lectures of yours which I heard made perfect sense to me I terms of the situation I was in.\n In that year 2022 during the health crisis of my parents, in many situations which were\n beyond the scope of my mind you had helped me like: ----\n 1.Local devotees helped me take my mother to hospital.\n 2.While going to Bhubaneswar we were going in the car at 90 kmph and the front tyre burst,\n but still we were saved.\n 3.Although it seemed for time being my mother had lost mental balance later, she recovered\n quickly.\n 4.When I wanted to show my mother to a famous heart surgeon, I came to know we can see\n him after 6 months but in the next day we could meet him, because of some acquaintance.\n 4.When I was in the car accident later and being taken to police station, I just tried to pray to\n you and as soon as we reached the police station, we found an influential devotee just\n beside it. He even gave his car that day to go ahead and later released our car from police\n station.\n It can be said these are all Krishna’s arrangement, but I would rather say it was all your\n benediction by which this arrangement happened.\n And every time I Have tried to put my consciousness to serve I have found your physical\n presence whether be it in Pune, Mayapur or at Govardhan.\n Your Vani in different lectures has been slowly correcting my blindness although my\n blindness largely remains. Even after some years of slow and so-called practice of Krishna\n Consciousness I find myself at the same place where I Started years ago. Due to my\n offenses, laziness and neglectful sadhana I have not been able to work in the direction of\n your expectations.\n Therefore, on this most auspicious day I beg at your lotus feet few benedictions. Let my life\n be of some service at your lotus feet. Please give me strength to follow your instructions.\n \n Please let me try to give me my offending and criticizing nature. Please let me do proper and\n attentive sadhana of hearing your lectures, reading Srila Prabhupada’s books and chanting\n as you have instructed. Let me remember all the mercy that has been gifted to me by you\n and many other Vaishnavas and let me remain grateful to them.\n Your servant,\n Rama Vallabh das"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada and his dearest son, Your Holiness! A happiest 75th Vyas Puja, Maharaja!\n \n Dear Guru Maharaja, as I sit to write down this year\u0027s Vyas Puja offering for the pleasure of Your Holiness, I\u0027m overwhelmed with the countless memories, reciprocations, and blessings that you\u0027ve showered in my life. As I look back, I find that you were always there, arranging situations in the best possible way to develop my Krishna consciousness.\n \n You have been the embodiment of Guru Nishtha throughout your life, through your body, mind, and words. The entire ISKCON knows and titles you as \"the real sadhu\". The qualities of pure devotional service unto Guru and Krishna, as spoken by the words of shastras and acaryas, are perfectly exemplified by you. Be it the padayatras, book distributions, sankirtan, management, leadership, devotee care, centennial, and countless such projects and responsibilities. Your glories are unlimited, oh dear Gurudev!\n \n If I talk about me, you have nonetheless picked me up from a random pit of dirt and abominable things and placed me in the care of HG Raghu Nath Das Prabhu and HG Raspriya Mataji. I can see my prayers have been answered—might or might not be by Krishna, but definitely by you, Gurudev. I don\u0027t know when I will be able to get purified of my disgusting consciousness, full of 6 anarthas, and come to that platform, but I aspire to be there, just like a child aspires to ring the bell in the temple. It cannot ring it on its own, but only if the father picks him up. Similarly, only if you mercifully give me your shelter can I serve rightly. What can I do to make your Appearance Day special from my side? The only thing I realized which pleases you most is when you see Srila Prabhupada\u0027s movement spreading throughout.\n \n I am in need of your blessings, Guru Maharaja, to serve efficiently in this lifetime. As I always pray, please always engage me in your service through my Shiksha Gurus, under their guidance. Only by the service opportunities they have provided me with have I gained the chance to write this Vyas Puja offering. Considering me the lowest among fools, please forgive my mistakes and glance at me with compassion, providing the right intelligence and opportunities to serve you.\n \n Your most fallen aspiring servant,\n Ramchandradas Prabhu\n Radharati Devi Dassi\n Amritsar\n Punjab"

In our endeavor to regularly hear your lectures through the yearly series on the ISKCON Desire Tree website, we are taking small baby steps to follow your teachings. We understand from the Parampara that the most significant way to please the spiritual master is by sincerely following his instructions. We strive not only to write what has been taught but also to apply it in our lives. Yet, we know these small efforts are insufficient without your blessings, for only by pleasing you can we make real progress in bhakti.\n\nReading *The Journey Home* gives us a window into your life—your early quest for the meaning of life, higher purpose, and spirituality ultimately led you to surrender to Srila Prabhupada. The most profound lesson we learn is your unwavering faithfulness as his disciple, imbibing his instructions fully. We also understand that while it may take time to become fully convinced of the bhakti path, once that conviction arises, there is no looking back. One must give one’s life and soul to please the Lord, the spiritual master, and the Parampara. We learn this from your life.\n\nDear Guru Maharaja, as we write, we feel as though you are sitting before us and we are speaking directly to you. With this mood, we strive to become more sincere each passing day, aware of the reality that we must remain vigilant against Maya. Recently, we heard your powerful teaching: Maya enters like a needle and then pulls us like a plough. This has left a deep impression on us.\n\nOn this landmark 75th Vyasa Puja, we know you have blessings for all your disciples and the entire world, yet we feel unable to fully reciprocate. Still, we renew our resolve daily to remain steady and sincere on this path of bhakti. Today, we once again offer ourselves at your lotus feet, praying to serve you in whatever way pleases you.\n\n“Purity is the force,” and we take shelter of the most often quoted śloka as our guiding light:\nOm apavitraḥ pavitro vā sarvāvasthāṁ gato ’pi vā\nyaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ sa bāhyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ\n\nYour insignificant servants,\nRanchor Krishna das\nAnandarani devi dasi\n\n13 November 2025\nKanhaiyadesh"

Dear Guru Maharaj, I know I am not qualified to be your disciple, yet I humbly beg you to kindly accept me as one. I cannot imagine my life without your divine presence and shelter.\n\nI still remember the day I first saw you in 2014 at the Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Temple, Chowpatty. I felt that you wanted to say something to me because I could feel it in your eyes, Gurudev. It was my deep desire to see you once, and when you glanced at me and smiled, I felt immense bliss. I still relish that sacred moment whenever I remember it.\n\nAt every step of my life, your lectures and your quiet guidance have illuminated my path whenever I have felt lost. Though I could not attend this year’s Kartik Yatra 2025 in Vrindavan due to dengue, I deeply missed your divine association, your nectarean lectures, ecstatic kirtans, and the blissful company of devotees. Although I could hear your lectures online, I still felt the absence of your vapu association.\n\nPlease kindly forgive me for not being able to join the yatra this time. Dear Gurudev, I sincerely request you to kindly chastise me through my counsellor or the devotees if I ever fail to perform my seva properly. You know the heart of your disciple well. I know that I am not as sincere as you expect me to be, but I am sincerely trying to follow your instructions with full faith. If by your causeless mercy you make me yours, I am sure I will become more sincere in my service.\n\nNo matter how much I glorify you, it will never be enough, for your qualities transcend all words and descriptions. If knowingly or unknowingly I have made any mistakes, please forgive me. I cannot imagine my spiritual life without you, my beloved Guru Maharaj. You are my lifeline, my only shelter, and my eternal guide.\n\nThis year has been emotionally difficult for me, as my beloved mother left her body on 30th April 2025. You know everything, Guru Maharaj—nothing is hidden from you. In this painful time, your instructions and presence have been my only source of solace and strength.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, please never leave me. I am a beggar at your lotus feet, seeking your causeless mercy. Kindly bless me with the strength and determination to practice pure devotional service and to always remember your teachings.\n\nFinally, I humbly pray to Sri Sri Radha Govind ji for your good health and long life so that you may continue to spread Srila Prabhupada’s mission and inspire countless souls on the path of devotion.\n\nThank you, Gurudev.\n\nYour aspiring servant and disciple,\n\nRanjan Kumar"

Although formal initiation is still quite far away, informally you have initiated me with your instructions a year ago, during the last Kartik Yatra in Mayapur 2024.\n\nYour love towards Srila Prabhupada, all your Godbrothers, all devotees, Vrindavan, and the jivas – whether they are conscious or unconscious – made me relish a drop of nectar from the spiritual world while living in the perishable material world. Your ‘vani’ blossoms my heart with joy and makes me forget the miseries of life, at least for the time being. Your instructions empower me to remain protected from maya and to serve the devotees. My Guru Maharaj, I am very, very indebted to you.\n\nJust now, during this Kartik Yatra of Govardhan 2025, I have received some of your instructions coming in line via some senior devotees. I am striving to live by and implement those instructions throughout my life. I am mentioning them here so that I may receive the blessings of all the Vaishnavas to help me follow them sincerely:\n\n1. Please go deep into chanting, hearing, and service.\n2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Krishna.\n3. Strive to be united as a community.\n4. Practice enthusiasm to share Bhakti - Krishna Consciousness.\n5. Never forget that Bhakti is not about quantity or numbers, but it is about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n\nMy Guru Maharaj, I humbly seek your blessings so that I can follow your instructions throughout my life. As you have mentioned, by following your instructions, I can offer you the best gift on your birthday.\n\nAlso, Guru Maharaj, I am struggling to cultivate the mood of ‘tṛṇād api su-nīcena taror iva sahiṣṇunā amāninā māna-dena kīrtanīyaḥ sadā harih’. At present, due to my diseased condition and the anarthas of my heart and mind, I find it difficult to overcome lust and ego. But I have full faith that I have come to the best doctor – one who can cure me and implant the love for devotees and, therefore, the Lord Hari.\n\nI am praying at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Govinda Dev Ji, Srila Prabhupada, and all the Vaishnavas, that they bless you with good health and long life so that your presence and words may continue to purify the millions of hearts and guide them back home, back to Godhead.\n\nOnce again, Guru Maharaj, I offer my deepest gratitude to you and to Srila Prabhupada for giving meaning to this short life.\n\nYour Insignificant Servant\nRanjeet"

You said that:\n\n1 \"The highest prayer is the prayer to become a selfless instrument in God\u0027s hands.\"\n\n- Gurudev, here you want to teach us that Krishna is our only hope. Whatever situation we are facing, just leave it in His hands, become His puppet. Being a selfless instrument will please the Lord.\n\n2 \"Just serve every creature in God\u0027s creation with humility, respect, and love.\"\n\n- From this, I can understand that all creatures are God\u0027s children, and Krishna loves all of them. Once, in the Radha Gopinath temple, there was a cat which was hurt badly, and you were so compassionate towards it that you wanted to make sure the cat received good medical care, and daily Mahaprasad was offered to that cat. Your love for cows is even more adorable to me.\n\n3 “When we speak of the dust of the lotus feet of the Spiritual Master, we are speaking of a humble approach to serve his instructions. Unless we humbly serve the instructions of the great soul, it is Krishna’s arrangement that He never reveals Himself.”\n\n- This is the real essence that you want to teach us: that the dust of the lotus feet of the spiritual master is to follow the instructions of the Guru. Otherwise, Krsna will never reveal Himself to us.\n\nGurudev, your love towards your Godbrothers and Godsisters is so adorable. You always talk about cooperation and unity in most of your classes. You always want us to be like a family and try to serve all with humility.\nOn this auspicious day, I pray that I can become a puppet in Krsna\u0027s hand and follow your instructions with utmost sincerity and humility. I also pray to the Supreme Lordships to bestow you with good health and long life, so as to always remain under your shelter.\n\nJai Gurudev!!!\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nRasa Bhakti Devi Dasi"

This is a special 75th birthday; however, you always say that we can please you by practicing Krishna consciousness, by wearing the verse of “Trinad api sunicena…” and a proper service attitude to all people in this world. Thank you for your easy accessibility through your vani – association, which will not just give one liberation from this material world but infuse one with “Krishna prema”. As mother Devahuti laments for not utilizing the association of Kardama Muni, which gives liberation from material bondage, I am reflecting in my life that I am getting so many opportunities to associate with yourself and other devotees; however, I am not utilizing those opportunities but am just attached to how I can take care of my parents, wasting so much valuable time which cannot be gained by any amount of wealth. As you always say, time is so precious, and the moment we waste without the association of devotees and glorifying Krishna cannot be brought back at any cost.\nMy only desire in life is to please you and your representatives by service and be an instrument in some way or other in the mission of Lord Chaitanya. Please bless me on this most auspicious day to have this consciousness throughout my life and not get diverted to material conditionings.\nThank you very much for showing us through your example to be in Vrindavan consciousness always. How you used to meditate on Vrindavan pastimes before honoring prasadam, how you keep the bus party van name as “Vrinda-van,” you created Vrindavan forest in a dumping yard and Gowardhan Eco Village, which is nondifferent from Vrindavan. Last weekend, one mataji from Mumbai came to GEV and she wanted to visit Barasana temple in Vrindavan forest, and after visiting Barasana temple, she got very much satisfied, and her lifelong dream came true. Thank you, Maharaj, for showing your personal care for every person on earth to uplift their consciousness towards Krishna.\nI will pray towards Krishna for your long and healthy life.

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj, Please accept our humble and respectful obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Today is a most auspicious day in our lives, for Krishna has mercifully sent you to guide us and give shelter to us conditioned souls. Time is a constraint, otherwise I would endlessly glorify you with words and prayers.\n I am deeply grateful to our beloved SS Radha Kalachandji and to our dearest Srila Prabhupada for giving you to us as our spiritual father. You possess countless qualities that touch my heart, but the one that inspires me most is your ability to see good in everyone. Even those who feel rejected everywhere are uplifted by your genuine glorification, which makes them feel important and worthy.\n Whether it is a great personality or a simple squirrel, your loving heart embraces all. I remember you once shared how you stopped your car to be with a deer who had just been struck and was leaving his body. That compassion reflects your nature. I also recall listening to your class on friendship, where you explained that when friends need us, we do not quote philosophy—we simply stand by them with love and a compassionate heart.\n I have personally experienced this. When I was new to Krishna Consciousness and struggling with bad habits and poor association, you showed me so much affection that the path of devotion became sweet and joyful. Today, whatever little service I am able to render in Srila Prabhupada’s mission is only because of your unlimited love and attention during those difficult days.\n Though you have many sincere disciples, you have always made even unworthy souls like me feel loved and valued. Your compassion has given me faith in Srila Prabhupada’s mission and deepened my love for him. I once read in one of your lecture transcripts that Srila Prabhupada is begging us to help him serve his spiritual master’s instruction. I do not know how to help him, but I pray at your lotus feet to please engage me in some way in your service to Srila Prabhupada, despite my laziness and distractions.\n Maharaj, I beg at your lotus feet—please always keep me in your shelter and service. I struggle with conditioning and lazy habits, but with your blessings I can move forward. This foolish daughter of yours seeks only your mercy to engage her mind in serving you.\n Every morning before serving the deities, we recite the prayer: “By the mercy of my spiritual master and following in his footsteps I have obtained the fortune to serve the lotus feet of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and SS Radha Kalachandji.”\n This prayer feels so true to me. I cannot even imagine how such mercy has come upon an undeserving soul like me—it is only and only an example of your compassionate heart. I do not know how to connect or serve Krishna properly, but I have faith that one day, by your mercy, you will engage me in serving Him according to your expectations.\n By your prayers alone, I have a family today and am serving in SS Radha Kalachandji Dham. Please always keep this unworthy child in your prayers and blessings, so that I may remain enthusiastic to serve devotees, life after life.\n My prayers to you on this special day is to please engage us Rasaraj Prabhu, Rasikarani \u0026 myself in your service always, always life after life.\n Thank you very very much.\n \n Your insignificant daughter\n Rasakeli devi dasi"

You further mentioned that we should know that we are not fortunate for what we are, but we are fortunate for what we have been given, and that makes our good fortune. I was highly taken aback with such profound understanding and wisdom!\nSo, yes, we are indeed very fortunate and our good fortune is due to what we have been given by Krishna, i.e. your association having you in our life or more benevolently by your acceptance of us under your merciful shelter.\nbrahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva, guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja\nAll living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe, and one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, and by the mercy of both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.\nLike Srimati Radharani accepted that small jackal who was crying, burning due to the fire, you accepted us who were burning in the fire of the material world, with your care, compassion, and loving-kindness.\nI really cannot fathom my good fortune of having got an opportunity to come in contact with a pure devotee of the Lord like you. Now when I look back, it only amazes me. I did not even know proper English, so I could not fully understand the first lecture I heard from your lotus mouth, and since I was afraid of speaking in English, I would not come near you physically, but my sustenance and nourishment have only been through your lectures, classes, kirtans, and your divine vani. Somehow, forcibly, I got hooked to your lectures/classes when I used to extract few droplets/lines out of them to share with others as daily morning Nectarean Mellows e-mails, and as I used to hear/record your classes for iskcondesiretree uploads, it nourished me more and more, and I started understanding and relishing the classes and instructions as well as the profound wisdom contained in them.\nIt has been a long journey and at the same time, maya is very strong, so I still need your mercy to get purified in order to come to the platform of true humility, tolerance, and cooperation, the principles you enumerate in your classes.\nWe seek your blessings and mercy that one day we can truly imbibe the teachings of Lord Chaitanya and Srila Prabhupada to perfect our existence in a way that may please you, Srila Prabhupada, and our exalted Guru Parampara.\nThank you for accepting us, and we endeavor to remain as servants of your servants.\nRasamrita Das \u0026 family Naambhaav Mataji, Madhuri Sakhipriya Devi Dasi, Kishori \u0026 Gauranga, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna.\n Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n On the auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, I feel both grateful and deeply humbled to offer this small and insignificant offering at your lotus feet. Your presence in my life is beyond words. The way you embody the mood and mission of Srila Prabhupada, and the many innovative ways through which you have tirelessly served to fulfill his desires, are profoundly inspiring.\n \n Your unwavering dedication to Srila Prabhupada for over fifty years—despite countless obstacles and challenges—reveals the depth of your surrender. Your meticulous attention to detail while serving Srila Prabhupada reflects the purity of your heart and the sincerity of your devotion.\n \n Guru Maharaj, through your hundreds and thousands of lectures, your kirtans, the divine experiences of your Kartik Yatras and Pune Yatras, and through your personal life and behavior, you have tirelessly served Srila Prabhupada and inspired me to serve his mission with the same mood. Yet, I am most unfortunate that I have not been able to fully take advantage of these priceless offerings.\n \n During the recent Kartik Yatra at Govardhan, one line you spoke pierced my heart: “The deepest Vapu association is the Vani of the spiritual master.”\n I beg at your lotus feet that I may sincerely take more and more Vani association from you, and realize deeply that the most intimate Vapu is indeed Vani. Please bless me with this clarity and understanding, so that I may take the Vani of Your Holiness and of Srila Prabhupada as my very heart, my life and soul.\n \n Kindly bless me that I may rise to the expectations and standards of practice that you desire from your disciples, and that Srila Prabhupada desires from his followers and grand-disciples. Someday, by your mercy, may I practice Krishna consciousness with even a drop of the sincerity and intensity that you and Srila Prabhupada embody.\n \n Guru Maharaj, I am trying in very small and insignificant ways to assist in youth preaching in Pune. Although I feel completely unqualified, I am somehow attempting to serve the devotees. I have also begun some humble online efforts to share Srila Prabhupada’s teachings with a wider audience, and I aspire to develop a substantial online outreach community in the future. Whatever little abilities Krishna has given me, I wish to engage fully in your service and in Srila Prabhupada’s mission.\n \n With folded hands, I beg for your blessings so that I may perform these services in the mood of the servant of the servants, keeping only one goal at the center—to please Your Holiness and Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Please forgive my innumerable offenses, known and unknown. I sincerely desire to improve myself so that someday I may become a worthy servant of you and Srila Prabhupada. Your mercy, Srila Prabhupada’s mercy, Krishna’s mercy, and the mercy of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu are my only hope. Kindly keep me always under the shelter of your lotus feet.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Rasapati Das\n ISKCON NVCC, Pune"

        "Your Offering ":  "mukam karoti vachalam\npangum langhayate girim\nyat-kripa tam aham vande\nshri-gurum dina-taranam\n“I offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, the deliverer of the fallen souls. His mercy turns dumb into eloquent speakers and enables the lame to cross mountains.”\n\nDear My Guru Maharaj, my Spiritual Master. Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to you on this most auspicious day of your Vyasapuja.”\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, you have so many wonderful qualities that are a great inspiration. I would like to highlight a few in the interest of time:\n\n        1. Guru nistha and Guru prem\nYou never lose a single moment to glorify your spiritual master A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Anytime anyone credits you with the wonderful service you are doing, you attribute it to Srila Prabhupada’s mercy and look for every opportunity to please your Guru. I recall during a disciple meeting in Alachua, when a devotee asked you about ways in which we can serve you, your answer was to help you serve Srila Prabhupada’s mission.\n\n        2. Tolerance, mercy and compassion - qualities of a sadhu\n\nYou are an epitome of tolerance as noted in several instances we read in Journey Home. You always quote the verse trinad api sunichena taror eva sahishnuna to teach us to be tolerant.\n\nYou are a true sadhu as you have the great qualities as mentioned in the following verse:\n\ntitikṣavaḥ kāruṇikāḥ suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām\najāta-śatravaḥ śāntāḥ sādhavaḥ sādhu-bhūṣaṇāḥ\nThe symptoms of a sādhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities. He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime. SB 3.25.21\n\nBy hearing about you from previous Vyas puja offerings, it is an inspiration to know the ways you develop and maintain such personal relationships with everyone, which surely testifies to your realization of your personal relationship with Krsna. You show such compassion to the living entities like me who are in a state of forgetfulness of Krsna, by constantly preaching and giving so much of your time, guidance, and care.\nGuru Maharaj, I am eternally grateful to you for giving me shelter and for blessing me during initiation. It has given me encouragement and great strength to render devotional service and to serve the mission of Sri Caitanya Maha Prabhu by spreading the holy name and message of the supreme lord.\n\nI am thankful to you for the enthusiasm that you provide to me to manage my spiritual life through your insightful lectures filled with enthusiasm and heart-warming humor. You are such an expert preacher, Guru Maharaja; each time I hear you speak I am amazed at how you are able to say exactly what I need to hear. I vow to continue to listen and apply lessons learned from the lectures and by hearing \u0026 reading about your glories. Only by your mercy can I perform devotional service while managing my prescribed duties.\n\nPlease bless me with increased Krsna consciousness so I may serve others in the humble mood of a servant of a servant.\n\nekaki amara, nahi paya bala,\nhari-nama-sankirtane\ntumi kripa kori\u0027, sraddha-bindu diya,\ndeho\u0027 krishna-nama-dhane\n\nAlone, I do not find the strength to chant the holy name of Hari. Please be merciful and, blessing me with a drop of faith, bestow on me the great treasure of the holy name of Krsna.\n\nI pray at your divine lotus feet to always have your shelter despite my shortfalls. Thank you for being there when I need you.\n\nI beg at the mercy of Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Madan Mohan to keep you in best health for preaching Krsna Consciousness all over the world.\n\nThank you for everything you gave me this year. I look forward to serve you more and more. Please bless me so that I can follow your instructions and become a worthy servant of yours.\n\nYour insignificant servants,\n\nRasarāja Gopal Dās and Priya Gopi Dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Your 75th appearance is a very joyous occasion. King Rahugana was instructed by Jada Bharata that the opportunity to perform devotional service cannot be attained unless one is blessed by the dust of the feet of great devotees. I see no reason other than your divine grace, bestowing on me the blessings coming through our dear Srila Prabhupada and our Acaryas, that is responsible for me having the opportunity to glorify you. Thank you.\n \n This year is also my 50th birth anniversary, a very fearful event. More than half of this has been in the association of devotees, and I have been contemplating on whether I have progressed at all, and what the nature of that progression is.\n \n In your sermons, you often times quote that Krishna is saragrahi; He sees the intent. It is only recently that I am able to understand the gravity of this. If He was only interested in the results of my service, or His grace would flow only to those that are uniquely capable and adept at doing certain services, then my situation would have been completely helpless.\n \n And over the years, it is your lectures and personal example through which you have been molding that intent in my heart. In spite of being adamant on being attached to my opinions and my ideas, you have molded the intent in my heart to serve the divine couple. Every class I listen to is almost as if personally meant for me, to help me understand my shortcomings, of which there are many, and to make adjustments in my intent.\n \n And when I fail to attentively listen to you, then I have seen that the opportunities to serve have dwindled, either by lack of personal motivation, or by the distaste to chant, or by being resentful of devotees and their association. But you have never given up. In fact, through the means of your disciples or by circumstances, you have brought me back to listening to you and realigning my intent.\n \n Thus, your instructions have become the very source of my survival in Krishna Consciousness. You give the intelligence and the opportunity through which I can still be around devotees. As you mention, Srila Prabhupada once mentioned that we should not be surprised that devotees leave; be surprised that they stay. My staying, Gurumaharaj, is just by your grace.\n \n So, my progress I think is that I have much more faith, and dare I say, complete, unconditional faith in your Grace, that you will never leave me. Wherever I am, you will come to guide me to surrender to the loving service of the Lord and His devotees.\n \n For that, as you have documented in your book, you have faced deathly diseases, violent, vicious attacks, family heartbreaks, personal abuse, scarcity, and so many insurmountable difficulties. For me! And you continue to do so. Year after year, you continue to provide the grace of the sweet, nectarian words carrying the full potency of the essence of all Vedic knowledge, sweetened by the realizations of our Parampara, uncontaminated in its essence, which nourishes me.\n \n Please accept these very insignificant services that you inspire. Your Kalachandji\u0027s Campus programs are now giving prasadam to hundreds of students daily and providing good revenue to the temple, and allowing pathways to enter into several campuses in North America. Through the Conscious Meals for All program, inspired by Food for Life, more than 30,000 meals are being served annually through Dallas. Recently, the Eco Farm community project has embarked to protect cows and create sustainable communities. The Atma Bhakti Center is slowly progressing and creating educational programs for several. Your Rasika Rani is trying to embark on a medical career, and she has also started a dance school. She is inspired by your Bhaktivedanta Hospital and wants to create a career around integrative medicine.\n \n Thank you, Gurumaharaj, for giving me entry into this sweet world of unlimited ecstatic service. I pray to remain engaged in a humble and insignificant way, with the right intent, in your service to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Your very insignificant servant,\n Rasaraja das"

We are all able to do this service by your grace only, we beg you to continue to shower your blessings on all of the team so that we can continue to serve devotees in this insignificant way.\nWe pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath and Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Behariji for your good health so that you may bring many more souls at the lots feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji.

I beg forgiveness for not writing an offering for such a long time. When I look back at my life, I shudder to think what would have become of me had you not mercifully accepted me. I am such a fool, repeatedly making blunders that bring suffering to myself and my family. Yet, despite my ignorance, you continue to shower your compassion upon me.\n Many times, my only strength came from hearing your lectures and chanting the holy name. These two gifts kept me alive and gave me the courage to continue. Because of my entanglement in job and family responsibilities, I often feel I have failed to follow your instructions properly, and that has caused some spiritual weakness in me. Still, you never gave up on me.\n The last four months were the most painful period of our lives. Everything seemed to collapse, and we shed tears almost daily. In those dark moments, only the holy name, Gaur-Nitai, and your instructions were our lifeline. By your mercy alone, the situation has now begun to improve, and we are hopeful that everything will soon be resolved.\n During those days, we were struggling just to survive in this material world, while also trying to hold on to devotional life. Whenever I felt helpless, I remembered your hardships and sacrifices in New Vrindavan. I remembered your profound words in your lectures, and the inspiring pastimes shared by devotees about your compassion and determination. These memories always relieved my heart and gave me new strength to continue.\n Gurudev, we are not sincere devotees. We are fallen, inconsistent, and full of faults. But even so, we have only one prayer: please never abandon us. Please keep us always in your shelter. Without your guidance and mercy, we have no hope.\n On this sacred day of your appearance, I sincerely pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Jee that They bless you with strong health, protection, and spiritual strength so that we may receive your association for many, many years. May you continue to illuminate our hearts with your nectarean Krishna-katha and transform our lives with your divine presence.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Rasik Raman Das, Rani Kumari, Ramya Kumari and Ragha Karn"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurudeva,\n I offer my deepest obeisances at your lotus feet. Today, on the auspicious day of your 75th Vyasa-puja, I pray that I may please you by being steadfast, loyal, and reliable in following your nectar-like instructions and assisting you in your service to further Srila Prabhupada and Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s mission.\n I was reading your recent heartfelt tribute to Srila Prabhupada, and I was profoundly moved by it. It reveals how perfect and worthy a disciple you are of Prabhupada. Your words are true to your actions that are visible everywhere I look.\n Your dedication, highly serious, and intellectually grounded practice of Krishna consciousness is abundantly displayed throughout the tribute. You are a humble and compassionate soul striving for the highest spiritual perfection while remaining deeply concerned with the welfare of a troubled world. You see your life’s purpose as an instrument of your guru’s mission.\n I can see from your repeated expression of gratitude for the transcendental gift and mercy that you received from Srila Prabhupada and your viewing your entire life as a beneficiary of this spiritual guidance. Also, your deep reverence and profound humility and true disciple attitude towards Srila Prabhupada are amply visible, including your expression of profound spiritual commitment and an earnest desire for guidance and mercy.\n I have not only seen myself but also heard from your godbrothers, godsisters, disciples, and followers alike about many godly qualities you possess to be a perfect spiritual master. As the saying goes, \u0027a perfect disciple is a perfect spiritual master.\u0027 I could see in you all the qualities of Srila Prabhupada, like being completely surrendered to Krishna, living out God’s word, full of compassion, and being resilient and steadfast. You are kind, peaceful, and charitable like Srila Prabhupada, while also being firmly convinced of your spiritual identity.\n Your commitment to servant leadership, leading by example, and your deep spiritual maturity and faith make you a true spiritual leader of human society today. This has been possible by your great qualities like careful and patient listening, empathy, healing, persuasion, and commitment to the growth of the people you deal with. You are a true visionary with a unique ability to see the future and inspire others to achieve it with strategic thinking, creativity, persistence, optimism, and excellent communication skills. You always inspire us to be adaptable, take calculated risks, and be resilient in the face of challenges, to look at things in overall perspective, and work in a collaborative and empowered team environment. All these qualities were visible starting with your early days in New Vrindavan as the lone pujari serving Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Chandra, followed by University preaching in Ohio, developing and growing Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Temple in Chowpatty into a thriving community and spiritual center as we see today, conceiving and developing Govardhan Eco Village, and many large-scale humanitarian and social initiatives, like Bhakti Vedanta Hospital, Midday Meal Program for children, schools, and orphanages, etc.\n Currently, you are one of the world’s most beloved and respected spiritual teachers who is guiding human society by emphasizing spiritual principles of Bhakti Yoga and social service.\n I do not think I will be able to glorify your transcendental qualities enough with my limited knowledge and capacity.\n I am an unworthy, unqualified, and fallen soul, yet you are merciful to give me shelter at your lotus feet by accepting me as your disciple and have given me the greatest gift of Krishna consciousness. I pray to be ever grateful for the mercy and compassion you have shown upon me.\n I am full of faults and shortcomings in serving you, for which I beg for your forgiveness. I pray my actions will always reflect my gratitude to you by faithfully serving those you love.\n Your servant,\n Rathayatra dasa"

This is your mercy towards me that I am able to come again and again in spirituality after so many downfalls.

I understand that it must not be easy to be in your position, in general, with all the responsibilities on your shoulders, but especially at times of Vyasapuja. I am hoping that glorifying you from my heart will please our dear Srila Prabhupada, and if he is pleased, I am hoping that you will be pleased.\n \n Writing this offering, my thoughts went back to this year\u0027s visit to GEV and Chowpatty temple in January and February. Both projects are beautiful manifestations springing from your heart; both are places that I consider my home. Why? Because my family is there, and because you are there, overseeing that everything goes according to the will of Srila Prabhupada and our glorious Parampara. It’s a place where I feel 108% aligned with myself and reunited with those whom I hold close to my heart. I deeply thank you for that!\n \n The day that I landed in Mumbai this year was the day of the flower festival in Radha Gopinath temple. I’ve heard about this festival for over two decades and seen it in *The Simple Temple* documentary countless times. There were years that I watched this documentary every day, just to be there in spirit with all of you. Now I was allowed to be there myself, and it exceeded all my expectations. Words cannot describe this glorious offering of you to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath… The depth of devotion, the joy of everyone present… by your desire, we are allowed to experience the spiritual world, and I deeply thank you for that.\n \n By your mercy, I am serving our Sri Sri Radha Gopinath here in Radhadesh. Being on the altar with the whole Parampara present, it is very clear how you are the connection for me to this glorious disciplic succession. I do not deserve this service in any way, but the fact that I am there shows your level of compassion upon me… and I once again deeply thank you for that.\n \n How can I repay my debt and reciprocate with your love? I know it’s impossible, but let me try it anyway. Let me get up every morning and read and chant and give my best throughout each day, often failing but continuing anyway. Let me continue to serve this community, family, and friends and do my little part. Then maybe someday you will be pleased with me anyway.\n \n Gurumaharaj, congratulations on your 75th birthday celebration.

Your lectures inspire us to be kind, humble, forgiving, and sincere in our devotional service to move on our spiritual path to meet our dear Supreme Lord Shri Krishna and end this cycle of birth and death.\n In today\u0027s life, when life gives challenges, I try to refer to the verses of Bhagavad Gita as it is written by our dearest Guru H.G Srila Prabhupada ji🙏\n Which inspires me to overcome the challenges and obstacles in our life.\n My heartiest wishes and prayers to you for your well-being and preaching, which is enlightening and inspiring millions of souls towards the spiritual journey.\n Dandavat Pranam 🙏\n \n Bhaktin🙏\n Reetu Anand"

        "Your Offering ":  "OFFERINGS TO HIS HOLINESS RADHANATH SWAMI MAHARAJ\n  \n Dear Most Guru Maharaj, \n  \n HARE KRISHNA\n \n Please accept my millions and trillions of humble obeisances unto your lotus feet, Maharaj. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga\n \n Maharaj, for the last 75 years, many fallen souls like me in this world have immensely benefited by your divine presence on this earth, and we pray that we will continue to receive your mercy for eternity.\n \n On this very glorious 75th year of your divine appearance, I wish to offer my humble thoughts on your divine and excellent qualities, which cherish and nourish all of us, and which I would like to imbibe in my life as a service to you.\n \n One quality, gratitude, is outstanding and naturally built into your great personality. We have seen in your Journey Home that from beginning to end, and in all situations, even to the extent of near-death experiences, you expressed your gratitude to Krishna. In all your classes, you genuinely express your gratitude to the audience, from beginning to end. You express gratitude to everyone and anyone without discrimination, seeing them as instruments and parts and parcels of God. On many occasions, you have shown this quality of gratitude even to taximen and liftmen, what to speak of devotees and your Godbrothers, to Srila Prabhupada and to Sri Sri Radhagopinath. As the attitude of gratitude is the most positive quality, my sincere prayers to you for bestowing at least an iota of the quantity you possess naturally.\n \n The second quality of your good self that naturally permeates to all of us is the ability to spontaneously appreciate others. This appreciation of others acts like such a tonic that everyone is favorably attracted to you. You always mention this quality of appreciating others in your classes and emphasize appreciating at the right time. Once Hg Radheshyam Prabhu shared that he was appreciating you with many mouths. After hearing him, you said, “I very much appreciate your appreciation.” That’s amazing and so witty. This quality of appreciation also creates a great positive environment and culture. I sincerely seek your blessings to imbibe it in my life and dealings with all.\n \n Another quality in you that amazes me is your ability to extend yourself for higher causes and for devotees, your Godbrothers, despite your not-so-good health. This is due to your unconditional, genuine concern for others. I heard one devotee sharing that during one of the Jagannath Puri yatras, you were very sick and not even in a position to get up from bed. It was decided that HH Bhakti Rasamrita Swami Maharaj would give class in the evening in the pandal to 5000-7000 devotees. Maharaj had also prepared for the class. However, in the evening, you were seen in the Vyasasan singing Jay Radha Madhav. When asked by one of your Godbrothers, after the class, how you came to give the class despite your ill health, you mentioned that “So many devotees who came from so far places and are eagerly waiting to receive Krishna katha, how can I be on the bed.” That’s the real, genuine concern you have towards the spiritual lives of your disciples and devotees. Maharaj, as I am very, very poor in this aspect of extending myself, I am sincerely begging for your mercy so that I can be of some use to others.\n \n Overall, Maharaj, each of your words and acts are great learning lessons for all of us.\n Today, on this most auspicious day of your 75th year of appearance, I sincerely seek your blessings to develop an iota of your unlimited qualities and be an instrument of your greatest quality of mercy and compassion and serve your mission to please Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Your eternal servant of servant of servant\n \n Remuna Das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nSrila Krishna Das Kaviraj Goswami mentions in Sri Caitanya Caritamrita quoting the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya 13.2:\n\nakṣṇoḥ phalaṁ tvādṛśa-darśanaṁ hi\n tanoḥ phalaṁ tvādṛśa-gātra-saṅgaḥ\njihvā-phalaṁ tvādṛśa-kīrtanaṁ hi\n su-durlabhā bhāgavatā hi loke\n\n“‘My dear Vaiṣṇava, seeing a person like you is the perfection of one’s eyesight, touching your lotus feet is the perfection of the sense of touch, and glorifying your good qualities is the tongue’s real activity, for in the material world it is very difficult to find a pure devotee of the Lord.’”\n\nOn this very auspicious occasion of your 75th vyasa puja, it is my great fortune to have the opportunity to express my gratitude for your unlimited kindness and grace upon me.\n\nAt each moment, you only desire to please Srila Prabhupada by making arrangements for all devotees to taste the nectar of chanting the Holy name and hearing the Holy fame of the Lord, to develop loving relationships with other devotees and to be eager to share their good fortune with all others. All the projects, processes, and initiatives are aimed at fulfilling this purpose alone. I remember that once when someone asked about \"what is important? projects or people?\", you very kindly replied, \"People are important, but what will they do without the projects?\" In essence, you have always established the projects in a \u0027devotee nourishment-centered\u0027 way, and thus the projects have become a source of benediction for millions of devotees to offer their loving services to Sri Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas.\n\nOne such miracle which I recently witnessed is the Kartik Yatra at Sri Govardhan. Although I have been a part of yatra participants or even the management team to some degree for the last several years, it is only this year that I was wonderstruck at your extraordinary genius in making this a LIVE experience of the spiritual world for all of us.\n\nI am amazed at how the senior-most members of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath temple and GEV are actively involved in organizing the Kartik yatra to ensure that your vision and legacy is transmitted without any loss. HG Shyamanand pr, HG Sanat Kumar pr, HG Gauranga pr, HG Baldev pr, HG Vasudev pr, HG Hare Krishna pr, HG Nand Dulal pr, HG Sundarvar pr, and several other senior brahmacaris are totally absorbed in taking care of minute details to make it a memorable experience for all members. Although they have enormous responsibilities and other services, they still keep yatra services at the topmost priority for your pleasure.\n\nI am not able to get into micro details of each department which functions during the yatra, but I wish to express my gratitude to you for creating the extremely rich culture and mood of Vaishnava seva at all levels. Not even once did I find any kind of breach of etiquette or raising of voice, or criticism, or fault-finding, or even disagreement in the entire process of organizing and managing the yatra. Differences of opinion have been dealt with in a very cordial way without any kind of offensive speech or action. I also saw the same quality of absorption, appreciation, and meditation on pleasing the Vaishnavas being passed down to the incharges of different services and departments. Each incharge has been meditating throughout the year to improve the quality of their offering to the Vaishnava community, and this is the very essence of spiritual dealings in the spiritual world. Be it Kitchen, Senior Vaishnavas’ prasadam serving, Pandal maintenance, Bus arrangement, Plate washing, Prasadam transferring and serving, Cooking, Chapati Making, Festival cooking, deity worship, Dham visit, Kids Zone, Accommodation arrangement, guests care, drinking water arrangement, registration, health care, stalls, sound system, waste management, or any other seva, every involved devotee had absolutely great absorption in executing it for the exclusive purpose of pleasing yourself and all the participating members. Thus, even an average devotee could get an experience of what the spiritual world would feel like. By your very thoughtful arrangement of cooking bhoga on firewood stoves by hundreds of devotees, everyone cried with real tears in their eyes in the Holy Dham in the most auspicious month of Kartik.\n\nOn my own accord, I do not have any capacity to practice the process of Krishna Consciousness properly or to serve the devotees in the right consciousness. However, by your own causeless mercy, you have appointed HG Radheshyam prabhuji as my caretaker, mentor, and master, and by his kind mercy and empowerment, I am engaged in some services for your pleasure. On this very auspicious day, I pray for your good health and well-being and humbly beg for a drop of mercy to live by the principles of humility, tolerance, and respecting all without expecting any respect. This is the only foundation based on which anything else I do can please your heart.\n\nThank you very much for revealing the spiritual world through GEV, Kartik Yatras, your absorbing lectures, your vibrant kirtans, your loving dealings with your god brothers and god sisters, and your very dedicated and devoted disciples.\nYour humble servant,\nRevatipati Das"

Maharaj, there is so much I want to express—so much love, gratitude, and admiration that I do not even know how to contain it. After reading your Autobiography, The Journey Home, my life, my heart, and my consciousness were deeply touched and transformed. It was the first book of my entire life that made me cry out of love that I never knew my heart could feel.🥺🙇🏻‍♀️🙏🏻\n \n There are certain moments from your divine journey that pierced my heart and made me weep:\n \n 1. When you were pleading before the Sikh officer to allow you entry into India—your love for India, for Krishna, for saints, and for all living beings radiated from those pages. Your sincerity shook my heart.\n \n 2. The moment you first met Srila Prabhupāda, and when he lovingly asked you to come on stage and sit beside him. That scene made me feel as though I was witnessing the meeting of a long-lost son with his eternal spiritual father.\n \n 3. When you were drowning in Mother Ganga, and in that moment of danger the Hare Krishna Mahā-mantra arose once again in your heart—just as Ganga had first revealed it to you. Those words made me cry uncontrollably, Maharaj. They revealed your deep, mystical relationship with the Lord and His holy names.\n \n 4. The humility, love, and compassion of Ghanshyam Baba—his devotion to his deities - Gopījana-Vallabha and his affection for you—filled my heart with reverence and tears. Such divine relationships are rarely seen in this world.\n \n Maharaj, after finishing each page of your journey, I felt a flood of love rising within me for you. I never imagined that someday I would adore anyone with such purity, respect, and heartfelt devotion. I feel so fortunate—so blessed—that I had the privilege to read about your life and experience a glimpse of your divine heart.\n \n My only desire in this lifetime is to somehow, someday, receive your divine shelter. I know I am unworthy, undeserving, and unqualified in every way. Yet I also know that by your causeless mercy, by your blessings, even a fallen soul like me can learn to serve Krishna with love, humility, and sincerity.\n \n Thank you, Maharaj, for accepting me. You bless every living entity despite their countless shortcomings. I beg you, please bless me too—so that I may become humble, kind, truthful, compassionate, and a good human being, and eventually, by your mercy, a sincere servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the supreme lord.\n \n I love you dearly, Maharaj. I pray that one day I may have your divine darśan, and get initiation from you Maharaj🥺🙇🏻‍♀️and that I may express everything in my heart before you personally.🥺🙇🏻‍♀️\n \n I bow down unto your divine lotus feet, beloved Maharaj.\n Please accept my humble and sincere obeisances.\n HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj Ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii🙇🏻‍♀️🪷🥺🙌🥺\n Your useless, unworthy, and undeserving servant,\n Rinki Bhatt\n Hare Krishna 🙇🏻‍♀️🪷❤️"

I came across your small talk... so ideally, you were the first face of ISKCON for me. I really liked your humility, Maharaj. I didn\u0027t know your name at that time.\n\nI later joined the Gurgaon ISKCON center and temples. After some time, COVID started, and centers and temples were shut down. At that time, through the Hare Krishna channel, I got connected to one Prabhu from GEV who was giving online classes. He was your disciple. Until then, I had heard many lectures in ISKCON, but when that Prabhu used to give lectures, it was really very heart-touching. I appreciated him once, and he said that it\u0027s my Guru\u0027s words which I am repeating.\n\nI inquired about his Guru, then for the first time, I got to know your name. When I checked the photograph... it was you... the same person. Maharaj, in a nutshell, I am completely sure if an egoistic soul like me can be surrendered to anyone, it is only you. You are the only one in whom I can never find any fault. Your actions speak more than your lectures... in any tough situation, I contemplate how you would react and then I react in a similar way.\nMaharaj, I am humbly waiting for the day when I can receive initiation from you. My name is already on the list, and I pray for your mercy that you kindly accept me whenever you feel it is right.\n\nMaharaj, I have sincerely examined my heart, and I feel a deep natural surrender and connection only with you. I do not feel this way with anyone else. Therefore, I am simply waiting with faith and patience for your guidance.\n\nMaharaj, I love and revere Srila Prabhupada deeply, and it is my heartfelt desire to remain within ISKCON under his shelter. At the same time, I do not want to take initiation from someone toward whom I cannot offer complete surrender. This is why I am placing my hope at your lotus feet.\n\nWhenever you decide is best, I am ready to follow your instructions. Kindly shower your mercy upon me.\n\nI have revealed my honest heart to you. I know I am way below your expectations, but you are like Krishna to me, so I wanted to say only the truth without any filter. Kindly save me.\n\nAlso, I have a deep desire to serve you.

On this auspicious occasion of your 75th VYASPUJA, we pray at the LOTUS FEET OF SRILA PRABHUPADA and SRI SRI RADHAGOPINATHJI to shower their choicest blessings upon you and bless you with good health and long life.\n \n GURUDEV, today when I go back in history of your \"Journey Home,\" I vividly remember the promise that you made to the Sardarji security personnel at the India-Pakistan border when you did not have any money to bribe the guards in your sincere and desperate attempt to come to India in search of GOD. Not only we, your disciples or aspiring disciples, but the whole world are and will be eternally indebted to the elderly Sardarji for his compassion and kindness in allowing you to enter India. Had he not shown compassion to you at that time, maybe none of us, including me, would have been writing our VYASPUJA offerings to you today.\n \n In one of your lectures, you mentioned that small things make a big difference. This act of the elderly Sardarji exemplifies the above statement. Had he not shown compassion, there would not have been a flourishing and vibrant RADHAGOPINATH devotee community, Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Annamrita Foundation, GOVERDHAN Eco Village, and many, many more other centers and projects.\n \n GURUDEV, today with full and firm faith and conviction, we can say with a clear heart that in many, many ways, you have more than fulfilled your promise to the Sardarji that if he allowed you to enter India, YOU will do something great for this country.\n \n GURUDEV, you have always put the comfort and care of others over your own comfort and pleasures, which we have seen in multiple instances wherein, in spite of ill health, you would brave all odds to give class or meet devotees or important guests to whom you may have given time. One small such incident was narrated to me by HG MADHVANAND Prabhuji of BHAKTIVEDANTA Hospital a few years back when he came to our house at Nagpur. He said once you had gone to the hospital for some meeting, and later on, you were supposed to give an evening class at Mira Road Temple. He said during and after the meeting, you developed a very high fever and severe body pain, because of which you decided to take rest. All the senior disciples and doctors at BHAKTIVEDANTA Hospital advised you against giving class in the evening, and they all were pretty sure that you would not be in a position to give class because of ill health. As planned, they all went to Mira Road Temple in the evening, expecting someone else to be the speaker. All were pleasantly SHOCKED and surprised to see you come on stage as if nothing happened and give a wonderful class. Prabhuji told me that according to the condition in which he saw you on the afternoon, it was IMPOSSIBLE for any normal human being to get up and give class in a matter of a few hours. This determination of yours shows your exemplary quality of putting people first.\n \n GURUDEV, like waves in an ocean, your good qualities are infinite, but this worthless soul cannot remember or describe all of them. GURUDEV, I sincerely pray at YOUR LOTUS FEET to grant me a drop of your infinite mercy so that I am able to follow all your instructions, especially the 3rd verse of SHISHASHTAKAM, of trying to become more humble than a blade of grass, more tolerant than a tree, and to offer all respects to everyone and not expect any respect from anyone.\n \n \n Praying for your good health and expecting to get a drop of your unlimited mercy.\n Your insignificant, worthless servant of servants,\n RSABHA DEV das\n Nagpur"

May RadhaGopinathji offer more and more strength to you to reach your compassion and love to each jiva in every corner of this world.\n \n Your presence in this world is the most important treasure for all living jivas. Lord Krishna has sent you in this world only for us, as you are not only the representative of Radharani for all ordinary and fallen souls to feel Her love and compassion, but also the feeling of hope in our lives by your presence in our lives.\n \n Maharaj, by your grace, it is very easy for us to feel the spiritual environment of Goloka in this material world also, where each and everyone is simply living for Krishna. Similarly, here we are all simply feeling alive for your love and pleasure. With this, we have a feeling of love for each other also, even though we all have different races, natures, and even many disparities between us in every aspect of life. But still, all of us have the same love for you, Maharaj. That feeling, especially, we felt when we all came in your association, like in Kartik yatra, where we all felt the most loving shelter with your association, and everyone was selflessly, purely seeking and feeling your loving shelter, like in Goloka, each one feeling for Krishna. Which itself confirms your special appearance as Krishna\u0027s arrangement for all of us.\n \n Your loving teachings are like sunlight rays reaching into the darkest forest lives of us. You, by your own examples, teach the three main principles of Lord Chaitanya: NAM RUCHI, VAISHNAVA SEVA, and JIV DAYA. Your total, pure surrender to the Lord\u0027s Name with simplicity, sincerity, and humility like grass and tolerance like trees for sadhana, with the only motive for the Lord\u0027s pleasure. And for Vaishnava Seva, by your sincere serving of all Vaishnavas, right from your wholeheartedly surrendering to your spiritual masters and loving relationship with not only your Godbrothers but with all Vaishnavas with a \"Das Anu Das\" bhava. And the most important teaching of Jiv Daya, by your teachings on how you are practically living and dealing with all entities of your surroundings, with how to achieve the highest consciousness of mind with a loving relationship with each and everyone in your surroundings, as Krishna is living in each and every heart of jivas.\n \n Yours is a clear vision on dealing with each and every situation of life, especially bad situations in our lives that are nothing but opportunities given by Krishna to us. And your most famous quote is \"finding hope in the most hopeless situation,\" which is really a practical solution on how to face all life\u0027s miseries while still remaining calm and happy to perform our duties in this world. All your Prabhupada and Acharya\u0027s purport teachings, by your own loving practical examples, are like showers of rain in the davagni of this our life.\n \n Offering deep prayers at the Lotus Feet of RadhaGopinathji for your healthy life, and please bless me that I may be able to develop some tinge of taste in Harinam, Vaishnav seva, and Jiv daya like you, Maharaj."

To express my gratitude, I would like to make an offering. Please accept it.\nI, your disciple, Rupavati Radhika Devī Dāsī, joined ISKCON in 2003.\nInitially, I was not in ISKCON.When I heard in one of your lectures that whatever spiritual work I am doing is entirely attributable to my guru, A.C. Bhakti Vedanta Swami Śril Prabhupāda.\nWhen I heard this, I couldn\u0027t understand its meaning. I was thinking, \"\"Whatever spiritual service Maharaj is doing, he is doing it himself.\"\"\nSo how can Maharaj be credited with his guru, Śril Prabhupada..\nMaharaj\u0027s words had such an impact on me that I thought about it for many days, but I didn\u0027t receive any answers back then. But today, 22 years later, I can confidently say that the entire credit for all the spiritual activities and services I have performed till today goes to you, my Guru Maharaj, Param Pujya Radhanath Swami Maharaj.\nGod\u0027s will is the Guru\u0027s will; God\u0027s qualities are the Guru\u0027s Vaishnavism. The Guru is the transparent medium who helps us reach God\u0027s qualities and makes us vaishnava.\nFor me, that transparent prayer is you, Maharaj.\nWhatever spiritual service I have performed , even if it is for my own purification, and whatever spiritual services I will perform in future, even if it is to express gratitude to the Guru Maharaj, the representative of God, the entire credit goes to you.I have no doubt about it today.\n I pray at the lotus feet of sri sri Radha  Madhava,Gauri Nitai Śril Prabhupada and your feet on this auspicious occasion.\n\nI pray The ISKCON organization flourishes day after day. The backbone of the organization guru maharaj may live long.May we stay united as guided by Guru Maharaj and always remain dedicated to the organization. May we find a place at your feet, this is our desire.\n\nYour faithful servant,\nRopaavati Radhika DD\""

I don’t know where to start from, but I want to talk about a few most important things:\n Hearing your words feels like sacred mantras, washing away our fear, awakening faith in Krsna again with more enthusiasm and energy.\n And how can I forget about your teachings which teach us to love every soul, no matter what, and giving our 1000% to make all devotees and people happy? Reminding us that every soul is a part and parcel of GOD, never hurt them. And also, you teach us that real strength is gentle, and real devotion is to love every soul.\n Physically, you have taught us no matter how tired you are, always try to please Guru and Krsna by pleasing devotees, especially senior, equal, Prabhupada’s disciple, other sampradaya gurus, and all humans. And you care for devotees in the way a mother does for her child, no matter how many faults we have, always finding that 1% of goodness in us when we don’t even see it. Sometimes I wonder how one heart can hold so much compassion, love, and happiness, even in tiredness and darkness.\n Maharaj, your life is a lamp of bhakti; your footsteps show us the way back to Godhead. So please ignore our faults and accept us. I promise I will try my best every day and every time.\n Also, I pray that one day I can walk in your footsteps with the same sweetness, humanity, and unconditional love that you have for Guru, sadhu, sastra, and devotees.\n I pray for a small place at your lotus feet where I can serve as per your wish and Krsna’s wish someday in the near future. Also praying for your good health, dear Gurudev.\n Also, please let me know how I can serve you? I know I am unqualified, but if you allow, I will get that strength by which I can serve.\n After praying for 3 years, this year finally, I could see you and meet you in Govardhan, and in those days, you have reciprocated all my prayers. You have given me strength, and how can I forget that beautiful smile of yours? When we were tired and wanted to rest, but at that moment, you were having the same energy, and your kirtan was the best part of the day.\n And thank you for singing the bhajan: Hari Haraye Namah Krishna Yadavaya Namah, Yadavaya Madhavaya Kesavaya Namah. I was waiting to hear it live from you, Maharaj.\n Thank you, Krsna, for sending Guru Maharaj into our lives.\n Yours servant,\n Sabina Bhandari"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Dear Guru Maharaja\n Please accept my humble obeisances.\n All glories to Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga!\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n \n Again, one more year has passed, and I feel so much that I am far away from the expectations of You, Vaishnavas, and The Supreme Lord who has instructed in Bhagavad-gita, and whose heart is revealed in Chaitanya Charitamrita by Krishnadas Goswami Maharaja. I am very grateful to You for accepting me, though with so many shortcomings, conditionings, and immaturity in dealings. But You have given me a chance to be with the devotees and learn and try to serve as best as I can. I have been given the best of Deities, association of devotees, and especially Senior Gurus/Vaishnavas, the best quality of prasadam, Srila Prabhupada Books to read, profound and deep classes, engagements in sevas as per my interest and nature, all facilities required to stay in ashram, and much more which I do not deserve. Daily, I try my best to hear Your classes, which are like a beacon light to a wandering soul like me to fix my goal and have the right aspiration, and they give proper guidance of the process to reach the goal in very practical steps.\n \n This year was very memorable as I got the chance to serve for Kartik yatra accommodation, for which to go to Govardhan in chilled winter and hottest summer. Before starting the seva, we had the opportunity to get Your blessings in GEV by the sincere endeavors of HG Sundarvar Prabhuji. We had surveyed and concluded that at max we could have 6000 accommodations in Govardhan, but by Your blessings, we realized that we were able to approach till 8500, and later we completed the target of 10000, though some accommodations were not up to the mark. This accommodation seva of Kartik yatra has been given since 2011, and though there were challenges and ups and downs, it is only by Your mercy that I have been able to carry on. Though by nature I am very introverted and to deal with new people, especially hotel persons, is not easy, still, devotees are allowing me to carry on. Also, in Pune, I am in the safe shelter of Your disciples, HG Radheshyam Prabhuji, HG Sundarshyam Prabhuji, HG Revati Pati Prabhuji, and HG Anatardwip Prabhuji, and many more. Hearing from them and observing their lives, mood, and mission gives Your remembrance.\n \n During the yatra, I could see how a sadhu\u0027s life should be, as You did not stay in that bungalow as You said its opulence is like that of Lord Indra, and You just accepted a simple room like other brahmacharis, and never You used the lift to go to the second floor, though in a day, You had to come and go at least 3-4 times. Also, in the morning, You did not take the van to go to the pandal. You gave Yourself almost 5 hours daily, including Your classes and Japa time, to all the disciples during the yatra, which is the greatest boon to all disciples. Also, Your visit to all the places was so much encouragement to all the serving devotees in different departments.\n \n On this most auspicious occasion of Your 75th Vyasapuja, Guru Maharaja, I pray to Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Vrindavanchandra, Jagannath Baladev Subhadra, and Sri Sri Gaura Nitai to shower Their glance and mercy on You so that Your health remains well and You continue in delivering so many souls towards the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath.\n \n Please forgive me for all my offenses and shortcomings in my sevas, and I seek Your mercy that I do not waste time and energy, rather use them to serve all devotees and overcome my selfish desires which are taking me away from the association of devotees.\n Your servant,\n Sachinandan Bhagavan das\n ISKCON NVCC Pune."

Then I thought, we shouldn’t be bothering you unnecessarily unless there is a need for my service. During Srila Prabhupada’s disappearance day offering in the pandal, you mentioned, if one is attached to the vani of the spiritual master, the vapu association of the Guru in its fullest form will manifest in the heart of the devotee. Maharaj, I really beg for your mercy to be able to follow this instruction of yours to hear your lectures attentively and practice your teachings to the best of my ability.\n \n We are very, very grateful for allowing us to be part of the wonderful Govardhan yatra this year. We can’t imagine our good fortune to be able to stay in Govardhan for 7 days and 7 nights, as Krishna lifted Govardhan for 7 days and 7 nights to protect all the vrajabasis. It was an amazing yatra, but it was not very easy due to Parikrama marg being closed on Diwali day, Govardhan puja day, as Govardhan was very crowded with many other pilgrims, and the commute between rooms and the pandal was far. But the good thing about it is every time we were traveling from the room to the pandal, we were getting an opportunity to do parikrama of Giriraj Govardhan. It’s a blissful experience just being in Govardhan inspite of all external factors. Maharaj, your lectures are amazing, deeper, and longer. You wanted to give all of us whatever you can give or more in those 3-4 hours. You were completely immersed in Krishna Katha. Unless there is a supreme power empowering you, it’s unbelievable for a 75-year-old person to sit straight for 3-4 hours without moving and speak Krishna’s pastimes with such enthusiasm. You probably can continue with the same immersion for even many more hours. But you end the lecture as it will get late for all of us, the audience.\n \n Maharaj, you always glorify in your yatra lectures the devotees who make chapatis for the devotees. This year, I personally got to witness their joy in serving the devotees by making chapatis. I am grateful to be able to serve with them for a few hours on one of the days. They serve from early morning 4:30 am till 2:30 pm for 10 hours continuously by kneading the chapati dough, rolling them, cooking them. But they are so blissful in doing their service. We also felt so much joy in being with them for a few hours.\n \n Maharaj, I met one of the matajis who was in that chapati making team from Belgaum. She is a very simple, middle-aged lady. We were exchanging our names. She told her name is Sukha Sagari. I told her my name. Then she asked me, did Maharaj explain to you the meaning of your name? I told no. She told me that Maharaj explained the meaning of her name. Probably she got initiated in the 90s when you used to explain the meaning of names of all the initiated devotees. Maharaj, probably you would like to do the same even now if it wasn’t for hundreds of initiations on the same day. She told that Maharaj explained the pastime of the devotee named Dukhi who carried water pots during Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastime, and Srivas Pandit prabhu told her name as Dukhi. Then Chaitanya Mahaprabhu immediately told her name, \"From now on, Sukhi.\" Maharaj told this is the meaning of your name. Similarly, Sukha Sagari mentioned that she lost her husband and was left with three children. So her life was also very miserable like Dukhi, but after Maharaj gave her initiation and named her Sukha Sagari, her life became very peaceful after that. She was telling, \"Our Guru Maharaj is not ordinary; he is very special, connected to the Guru parampara all the way up to Krishna. So he knows what is needed for the disciple.\"\n \n While making chapatis, Sukha Sagari mataji was humbly guiding us and telling all of us that in those 10 hours of service every day, she never let one chapati get burnt and go to waste. They are very conscious in their service. Maharaj, I pray at your lotus feet, please bless us also with a minute fraction of their enthusiasm to serve the devotees.\n \n Maharaj, we would like to thank HG Prem Chandra prabhu for facilitating Journey Home hearing narrated by you in a group setting in Dallas. Our sons, Chaitanya Charana and NadiaVihari, love to hear and read The Journey Home, and they love to hear again and again your New Vrindavan lecture series with so many adventure stories. Maharaj, please bless them to be attached to the words emanating from your lotus mouth and to be able to perform devotional service.\n \n Maharaj, we beg for your mercy to be able to chant the holy names attentively, to cooperate with devotees, and together render service in a way pleasing to you and Srila Prabhupada. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for all that you do for all of us.\n \n Your grateful daughter,\n Sada Nandini Devi Dasi."

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurudev,\n  Please accept my humble and respectful obeisances at your lotus feet. Gurudev, by your causeless mercy, I got a chance to practice Krsna consciousness. After coming into Bhakti, I came to know this movement was started by Prabhupad, and he spread it all over the world. But how I got this opportunity is only due to your causeless mercy. I came to know that under your grace, HG Radheshyam Prabhuji started youth preaching, and under him, HG Adigopal Prabhuji, HG Pankajgop Prabhuji, and HG Siddeshgaurang Prabhuji started VOICE in Nanded, named as Nandgaon VOICE. And under them, my mentors HG Narayanrishi Prabhuji and Aditya P, and my cousin brother who was already practicing Krsna consciousness, helped me a lot to take up Bhakti. First of all, I offer my respectful and humble obeisances to all of these devotees. There are a lot of devotees who influenced my life and encouraged my devotional service; due to them, I am holding on to Krsna consciousness.\n \n Gurudev, I have understood or not, I don’t know this Bhakti process, because I have not taken it seriously. Please forgive me, but honestly, I am not listening to Prabhupad\u0027s lectures and your lectures. I know I should hear them, but the force inside me takes me away. I am very much distracted by social media. I want to become sincere, but I am not able to control myself. I want to practice Krsna consciousness throughout my life and life after, in association with devotees only. But looking inside, I find I am not at all eligible for that; surely, in some days, Krsna will kick me out from Bhakti. But I don’t want to leave Krsna consciousness at any cost. Gurudev, please forgive me; I don’t know what I should offer to you. But I want to open my heart to you today. I don’t know whether you will read this or not, but my counselor had told me if we are sincere, then our Guru has a heart-to-heart connection; he understands everything. But I am a sinful person.\n \n Gurudev, please forgive me. I think I was supposed to offer something good happening to feel you happy, that your aspiring disciples are happy in Krsna consciousness. But Guru Maharaj, I want to offer my life to Krsna, but I am holding on to Anarthas. Gurudev, please help me to get out from the Anarthas.\n \n I am bewildered by this material energy. I am now trying to get a job and practice Krsna consciousness for a stable life. But not getting a job, and due to this, my practice of Krsna consciousness is hampered. Honestly speaking, before also I was not that much serious, but from that also I have gone down.\n \n Gurudev, at last, I beg forgiveness at your lotus feet because even after coming into Krsna consciousness and associating with devotees for a long period of time, I am still a dull-headed, sinful person, holding on to anarthas in my heart.\n \n I beg at your lotus feet, please award me with ruchi in chanting the holy names of the Lord, strength to fight with anarathas, and to practice this Krsna consciousness in the association of devotees life after life. Maharaj, I am dull-headed. Please accept me; please don’t reject me.\n \n And please forgive me; I don’t know exactly what I can offer to Guru Maharaj. I chose to open my heart before you, Maharaj.\n Your Humble Servant\n  Sagar"

Around 2 years back, I was a porn addict. I used to watch for hours, Maharaj. Even after coming to Bhakti, due to my past misdeeds, I was entangled in watching these things, Maharaj. Once I heard your lecture recording of Chapaty temple. In that lecture, you explained about the crow mentality and how this sex enjoyment is not at all an enjoyment. Then a shift began, and I understood what this actually is. And as many times you said, we need to understand actually who we are, what is our actual identity. This point helped me to think that what I\u0027m doing is completely wrong and does not give me real pleasure, Maharaj. Genuinely writing, I may have heard the same thing so many times by different respected devotees, but when you said it straight, it went into my heart and gave an actual impact. I remember this time in Kartik Yatra when you were narrating the pastimes that we may have heard numerous times, but still, when you narrated those pastimes, actually I heard every lecture at least twice, still want to hear them again. Maharaj, genuinely I have no words to thank you. Countless times I prayed at your lotus feet for protection from these desires. Every time you heard my prayers, and by your mercy, I was able to surpass these desires. I request, Maharaj, to always please keep me in your shelter. And Maharaj, I genuinely want to become your spiritual son, Maharaj. Kindly please accept me at your lotus feet and please give me some service opportunity if possible. I do not want to waste this life anymore.\n Hare Krishna Maharaj dandwat pranam."

From the very first moment I heard your voice—soft yet thunderous with love for Krishna—I knew my life had found its true direction. Your every word, every glance, every smile has been a shower of nectar upon the barren field of my heart.\n\nI remember your tireless preaching in the early days—travelling from village to village, city to city, sometimes with fever, sometimes without proper rest—yet never compromising on your sadhana or your love for Srila Prabhupada’s mission. You taught us that devotion means to *live* for Krishna, not merely to speak about Him. Your life is the living Srimad-Bhagavatam—each chapter a lesson in surrender, each verse a call to love.\n\nEven now, at 75, your enthusiasm remains undimmed. You rise before dawn for mangala-arati, chant with tears in your eyes, and preach with the fire of a young brahmacari. Your journeys across continents, your care for thousands of disciples, your personal touch with every soul—these are not duties to you, but expressions of your spontaneous love for Guru and Gauranga.\n\nMaharaj, you have shown us that *bhakti* is not a ritual, but a revolution of the heart. You taught us to see Krishna in the eyes of every living being, to serve with humility, and to chant with longing. Your laughter melts material bondage; your silence speaks volumes of Vraja-prema.\n\nI am painfully aware of my countless shortcomings. I have failed to follow your instructions with the seriousness they deserve. My chanting is distracted, my service inconsistent, my heart still entangled in maya. Yet you never withdraw your mercy. Like Lord Caitanya with Jagai and Madhai, you embrace the most fallen.\n\nOn this sacred day, I beg only this: *Please never give up on me.* Let me remain forever a speck of dust at your lotus feet. If I have any good quality, it is only your mercy reflected. If I have any hope, it is only your grace.\n\nMay your divine health be protected by Sri Sri Radha-Gopinath. May your preaching mission expand unlimitedly. May every desire in your heart—for the pleasure of Srila Prabhupada, for the awakening of pure love in every soul—be fulfilled a millionfold by the combined mercy of Sri Guru and Gauranga.\n\nAspiring to be your eternal servant,\nYour insignificant disciple,\nSanatan Caitanya Das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\n Srila Prabhupada ki Jay.\n \n Maharaj, we recently attended the Govardhan Yatra. It was a very blissful experience in many ways. Being in the holy dham, listening to your nectarine lectures and those of other devotees, and visiting so many sacred places filled my heart with gratitude. There were challenges too, as there always are, but every challenge brings new learnings.\n \n By your blessings, I am trying to gain a little more wisdom, though I remain very lowly and incapable of improving on my anarthas and mistakes. I am a slow learner, still trying to serve my duties at home, in society, and in the temple. Yet, because of my limitations, I often struggle with anarthas interfering in my duties and service.\n I try to stay connected by reading a few verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam daily. These teachings are such a great shelter for someone like me who faces many challenges in improving. I am trying to imbibe some of these lessons — to continue chanting seriously, continue doing services in the temple, continue serving my family, and continue helping the community in whatever small ways I can. More importantly, I pray that somehow I may also serve you directly, in a way that pleases you.\n In family life, something or the other keeps happening, giving excuses for not meeting the expected standards. Life teaches many lessons every day. I just pray that I learn the right lessons and live my life with sincerity, gratitude, and dedication to you — to your words and teachings — fully absorbed.\n I am trying to improve my dealings, behaviour, and practices, but many times I see that I am not capable of doing everything on my own. I can only put some effort, but to overcome my shortcomings, I definitely need your blessings. To render any meaningful service, I need your empowerment so that I may serve in the way you would want me to serve. If I can please you even in a small way through my practices, behaviour, and services, that will be my success.\n Maharaj, I especially beg for your blessings so that I may chant the holy name sincerely, with complete absorption, with my heart focused on pleasing you, Srila Prabhupada, the Lord, Srimati Radharani. I pray that my chanting becomes more and more focused, attentive, and filled with genuine feeling — not mechanical, not distracted — but offered as a small attempt to serve Their Lordships. Only by your mercy can I develop such sincerity and determination.\n There are many priorities in life, and I pray that everything is arranged properly so that I can serve with the right attitude and right consciousness — treating others fairly, caring for my family, serving the larger community, and at the end of life feeling satisfied that I have served the devotees and the mission with proper gratitude and a humble heart, as your insignificant servant.\n I pray that all family members continue to stay engaged in good health and consciousness, and advance, so that we develop the right mood of service and devotion, as you would expect from us.\n \n Maharaj, we sincerely pray for your good health, constant inspiration, and blessings through your words to us and many millions of souls for many more decades through your personal association. You are so dear to Krishna, Radharani, and Srila Prabhupada, and as your servant, my family prays for your blessings upon us and inspiration on many millions of souls.\n \n Your servants,\n Sanatan Gopal Das\n Radha Sangini devi dasi\n Dhruva\n Radhika"

This is the ultimate goal of our existence, and to achieve it, we seek your blessings, Gurudev.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to you, Gurudev, for allowing us to receive your association and instructions through your lectures and activities. Though we have not personally seen Srila Prabhupada, we see how enthusiastically you follow the instructions of your spiritual master. We feel truly fortunate to witness our own spiritual master following his Guru with such love, sincerity, and integrity. This inspires us to follow you with the same devotion and spirit.\n\nEvery day we are realizing the goal of our lives more deeply, and through this realization, our spiritual happiness increases with each passing day.\n\nGurudev, you have made us truly rich, for Srila Prabhupada says that real wealth is not material but spiritual. You have enriched us immeasurably in spiritual life.\n\nWhen we look at people in society suffering under the three modes of material nature, we realize how merciful Srila Prabhupada and you have been in placing us on the higher platform of *bhakti-yoga*. We are profoundly grateful for this gift. We remain committed to serving you and Srila Prabhupada until the last breath of our lives, in the humble mood of the servants of the servants. Please bless us, Guru Maharaj. 🙏\n\nIn 2017, while on duty, I lost vision in my left eye. My mother, Amal Bhakti Devi, who is now 94 years old, has been bedridden since then. Because of her condition and my partial loss of vision, it became challenging to go out regularly for *seva* and spiritual programs. I could not neglect her care, which created a dilemma for me. So, at times, I stayed home to care for her while Swarup Shakti Devi Dasi attended temple programs, and other times, we switched roles. I began searching for a place near our temple, where I could take care of my mother and also engage in temple *seva*, serve the Vaishnavas, and attend programs to stay in the association of devotees. By the mercy of Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Behari ji and Madan Mohan ji, your project \"Govardhan Kunj\" was announced, and by great fortune, I received an allotment there. This has provided us a wonderful opportunity to care for my mother at home while also engaging in *seva*, attending temple programs, and having the company of devotees.\n\nAt the time of the project’s inauguration, that is *Vastu Puja*, you addressed us with just two words — \"Welcome home!\" At that very moment, we felt sheltered and realized that this truly is our spiritual home.\n\nThank you for everything, Guru Maharaj. Please bless us, Gurudev, so that we can serve our mother and all devotees with proper consciousness, in the mood of humble servants of the servants.\n\nYour humble servants,\nSanatan Pran Das and Swarup Shakti Devi Dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna🙏\n Dandavat Pranam\n ALL GLORIES TO SRILA PRABHUPADA🪷\n ALL GLORIES TO YOU SRILA GURU MAHARAJ✨\n I pray to Lord Sri Nityananda, who is Adi Guru, to bestow His divine mercy upon me so that I may try my best to express my sincere gratitude to my beloved Spiritual Master and His loving devotee HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj Srila Guru Maharaj.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, please accept my humble obeisances.\n Once I had a question in my mind, that nowadays the personal Vapu association of Guru has become most rare... अति दुर्लभ... and then how can one who is a neophyte aspiring devotee serve and understand the mood of Guru Maharaj?\n And to this question, my beloved Shiksha Guru and loving and sincere disciple of Guru Maharaj, HG Vamsi Mohan Prabhu, explained it so wonderfully. He said, \"We can hear and serve the representatives of Guru Maharaj. They can teach us, guide us, encourage us, and most essentially, if we genuinely serve them, then they, with compassion, help us to understand the deeper mood of Guru Maharaj.\"\n And truly, Maharaj, this statement was so true and powerful that I have experienced it many times in my life.\n Out of unlimited and causeless mercy on a conditioned and degraded soul like me, You, Guru Maharaj, have blessed me with the association of so many of Your wonderful, sincere, and dedicated disciples that they are most mercifully uplifting everyone around them by repeating Your Vani as it is. Amongst them is Your beloved disciple, HG Vamsi Mohan Prabhuji. Practically the most humble person that I have ever met in my life. Every single ingredient of bhakti that a neophyte person needs is all I have been receiving from Prabhuji. He is just repeating Your Vani and always giving me deeper and deeper insights of Your teachings. Always filled with divine motivation, mercy, and love, he always encourages me to take the shelter of Your Vani in every circumstance. As You always, in all Your classes, emphasize two most important aspects of devotion: 1. More humble than a blade of grass, to be as tolerant as a tree, to give all respect to others and accept nothing in return. And 2. To be always striving to serve in the mood of a SERVENT OF THE SERVENT OF THE SERVENT OF THE SERVENT.....\n Your sincere and loving disciple, HG Vamsi Mohan Prabhuji, is actually the personification of these two aspects.\n I feel most fortunate and blessed to be in his association, and he, at every step, encourages me to take Your shelter and always helps me to attach my consciousness at Your lotus feet.\n \n Maharaj, through Your classes, You not only teach the deepest philosophy of the most rare Krishna Consciousness but at the same time, You give Krishna to everyone. You make everyone understand and feel that Krishna is everyone\u0027s shelter. Also, You encourage all Your disciples to do the same, i.e., to give Krishna to everyone.\n This spirit I experienced most strongly while assisting one of the most dedicated aspiring devotees, Esha mataji, in the 2024 book marathon. She was not only trying to distribute the books but was trying to give every single individual an amazing and never-to-be-forgotten experience where they could appreciate the divine atmosphere of the temple and take up Krishna Consciousness. This made a very deep impact in my heart that how Your disciples repeat Your words through their actions.\n \n Maharaj, I remember one of the most profound pastimes narrated by HG Ishwar Gaurang Prabhuji.\n Once, a few Brahmacharis at Chowpatty temple came to You and asked to motivate the entire congregation for the upcoming Book Marathon. There, Your answer to them was the most wonderful I have ever heard to this date.\n You said to them, \"You all may distribute much more books than last year, but yet, I pray that you all should rank last, so that other devotees must distribute more and more books and ultimately must increase the Book Distribution score.\"\n But when, a few days later, HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj came to Mumbai to motivate devotees for the Book Marathon, then again, all the devotees came to You and asked for blessings that they may distribute more and more books than previous years, and then You blessed them by saying: \"May you all distribute more and more books this year and get the rank 1st.\"\n And upon hearing this, everyone was shocked, and then You explained that..... \"Although we distribute books every year, we never rank first. But because this year HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj motivated us, we got so charged, motivated, and boosted that the loosers like us got the rank first, only and only because of the empowerment of HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj.\"\n Such a deeper and insightful spirit, Maharaj, you expressed that for the rest of my life, I can never forget this Bhava or attitude that you inculcated in all of Your disciples.\n \n HH Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaj expressed in his glorification of Yours that you always try to serve in a way that you always try not to come into the limelight or to be recognized. But always endeavoring to serve in the most insignificant way or in a way in which you may not be recognized by the crowd. But Krishna\u0027s arrangements are so wonderful that when He desires to glorify His devotees, He does so. And today, not only in our SP\u0027s moment but all over the world, we can see and feel the impact that you have made on society. Carrying the teachings of SP, you are mercifully giving Krishna to everyone, every single living entity whomever encounters You.\n Also, inculcating the same spirit in Your disciples.\n \n Maharaj, I am unlimitedly grateful to you for all your wonderful association through your divine and merciful and empowering Vani. Also, every year, You arrange a transcendental Kartik Yatra where you bless everyone with Your Vani association and also the warm and soothing presence, making every single devotee\u0027s Kartik month filled with spiritual nourishment and deeper and wonderful realizations.\n I strongly believe that only because of Your causeless mercy upon me, I received the opportunity to attend this divine Kartik Yatra, and I eagerly wait for attending more and more.\n \n Maharaj, I am a completely insignificant and degraded, unqualified soul. What can I pray? But I pray at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Vrindavanchandra Bhagavan to encourage me to serve Your Vani most sincerely. May all Your instructions be my life and soul. May I just develop the bhava of a menial servant of the servant, and in the same mood, may I always serve all the Vaishnavas. May I develop a drop of eagerness and sincerity to contribute some little service in this great moment of our Beloved SP. In the most humble mood, may I always serve my loving Shikshaguru and Your beloved and dedicated disciple, HG Vamsi Mohan Prabhu.\n I pray, Lord, that I always be deep-rooted in Your instructions and desire.\n \n Please forgive me for all my shortcomings, offenses, and mistakes and irresponsible attitude toward the devotional path. Maharaj, You can kick me, slap me, chastise, do everything that You feel appropriate for or You desire. Maharaj, I just pray, Maharaj, please never reject me, never.\n \n Seeking Your Shelter🙇‍♀️\n Your Aspiring Servant of the Servant...\n Sanika"

You always teach that a Vaishnava should remain humble and compassionate.

It is something that both surprises me and awakens a deep curiosity in my heart. They speak of a kind of love they experienced with SP, a love so powerful, so personal, so transformative, that surrender seemed to arise in them naturally.\n \n Even after decades of separation, this love remains alive in their words and is visible in their life of dedication. Hearing this, I often wonder: What really is that love? How does it empower them to go far beyond the usual limits of time, energy, and even what we consider natural constraints? How does it command such devotion that the entire world becomes insignificant in comparison? Sometimes I question whether I will ever truly understand it, what to speak of experiencing it directly. Yet, through their testimonies, I have received at least one clear hint: where there is true love, there is total surrender.\n \n When I hear how personal SP was with you, how he reciprocated, encouraged, and recognized your sincerity, I feel especially blessed. Your honesty, your humility, your search for truth, and ultimately your offering of your life at his lotus feet, all move my heart deeply. You do not highlight mystic experiences, though you certainly had them. Rather, you highlight sincerity, humility, and selfless dedication. And it is this simplicity, this genuineness, that teaches me more than any miracle.\n \n I know I have so much to correct within myself. But I am grateful for what I have already received, even though I have yet to realize its full value. I pray that I may truly recognize and assimilate the jewels of wisdom you give in your classes, and that I may one day awaken even a drop of the same love and surrender that you have for SP.\n \n I beg for your blessings so that I may become worthy of serving your mission with the required Vaishnava qualities.\n \n Your servant."

Gurumaharaj, You are very, very dear to my heart. It\u0027s your 75th Vyasa puja and it is very, very auspicious for me.\n As a fallen soul, I am so insignificant to glorify Your divine qualities. But for my love and purification, I want to offer something at your Lotus feet.\n Gurumaharaj, initially, I had no connection with you, but it was the mercy of Srila Prabhupada that he connected me with you. Oneday, I had seen your picture on Instagram. It was the picture in which you were dancing in kirtan. When I saw this picture, suddenly I felt the presence of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. And yet, I have kept that feeling in my heart. That day, I was lost in your deep emotion for Hari naam. After sometime, I started listening to your lectures and listening to kirtan also. And day by day, I felt I am becoming addicted to this. Even I cannot sleep without listening to your kirtan. Your Kirtan is more tasty than ice cream.\n The most divine quality which attracts me so much is your compassion to everyone. Actually, I have learned true kind love from You. You always say we can love everyone when we are detached from this material world. Your love, compassion, humbleness, integrity are unbeatable, unbearable. How can I glorify you, my Gurumaharaj? My words have no power to glorify you.\n \n Gurumaharaj, yet I have never seen you physically, but I never feel your absence anymore. I always feel your presence by your lectures. Your lectures are like nectar to my ears, which always transform and relish my soul. But I have the urge to see you one day with my eyes. That day my life will be successful. But I don\u0027t know when this good fortune will arise for me??\n Once, in a lecture, one devotee asked you who is your favorite deity? And you said with full of devotion and love, \"Harinaam.\" When I listened to it from you, I could feel your pure love and deep connection with Krishna\u0027s name. And also, oneday, one another devotee asked you what is your favorite sweet? You stopped for sometime and said, \"Chanting of Hare Krsna Mahamantra.\" Your love for Krishna is incredible. As a pure soul, you know everything.\n Every morning, I start my day by seeing your picture on my wallpaper. It gives me more energy and more courage to do my spiritual practice.\n I don\u0027t have much personal experience, but I want to share one experience – it was the day of arrival of HH Indradyumna Swami Gurumaharaj to Remuna Iskcon. I was there for the association of Gurumaharaj. There was a lecture of HH Indradyumna Swami Gurumaharaj in the evening. I was alone here, meaning my friend had gone and left me alone for her some works. I have a little bit of social anxiety. When I am alone and see many strangers around me, I feel very awkward. On that time, my body vibrated automatically. So, I prayed to the Lord Gopinath and started listening to your lecture and making notes. Slowly, slowly, I felt my fear fading away. After sometime, I felt much better. That day, I realized the power of your association. Maybe it\u0027s physical or not, you are always with me. And also, I felt if there is your Gurudev with you, then you are the most powerful person in this world. You can do anything.\n My dear Gurumaharaj, your dedication to Srila Prabhupada is incredible. Now you are living your life for Srila Prabhupada.\n Now I am reading your books, \"The Journey Home.\" This book is such a great inspiration for the conditioned soul like me. Your sacrifice, your unmotivated and uninterrupted devotion for Krsna is just stunning.\n I am so much inspired by your simplicity and compassion for everyone. You never see any difference among any soul. You are always ready to give your mercy to a fallen soul.\n \n Ooo, my Gurudev, You are a true representative of Gauranga Mahaprabhu and you are the real \"Prabhupad\u0027s Man.\" Lord Gopinath always bless you. Always keep you at His shelter.\n You know everything about me. I am the most fallen soul in this world. I always need your mercy for upliftment. I don\u0027t know if you will accept me as your disciple or not. Even I have not such qualification. But Gurumaharaj, always keep me as a dust particle at your Lotus feet and allow me to serve you for the rest of my life uninterruptedly. Please accept me as your daughter. And\n \"Let me live as Your servant. Die as Your servant. And awaken only as your servant of servant of servant.\"\n \n Yours most insignificant Daughter,\n Sarojini."

This year, you made the yatra very special for me again with your wonderful lectures, dancing kirtans, etc. Your presence in the pandal area was making us aware of the mood which you were telling in your lectures. Some of the points were so striking that they were very much applicable to me to improve upon. Like you said in the very first lecture, material energy deals with devotees and non-devotees in the same way, but a devotee deals with it differently in a mature way.\n Your lectures give us wisdom and many more things to apply in my personal life.

I cannot fathom what spiritual merit I must have accumulated to seek your shelter in this lifetime. Yet even that pales before the magnitude of your causeless mercy in accepting an insignificant being such as myself as your disciple.\n \n I am constantly inspired by the boundless ocean of qualities you embody. Each time I hear your teachings, I am moved to cultivate these virtues in my own life. Yet I confess my weakness—I quickly lose momentum, succumbing to laziness and complacency, failing to approach my Sadhana and service with the seriousness they deserve. I humbly beseech you to shower your mercy upon me and grant me the strength to apply your teachings with unwavering sincerity and dedication.\n \n I often question my worthiness of this precious human birth. I am neither materially nor spiritually qualified; my worldly pursuits leave me struggling to keep pace with an ever-changing world, and my spiritual practice remains inconsistent.

You have shown me the path of Bhakti and meaning to my life.\n\nI came in contact with ISKCON in 1992.\nBeing merciful and compassionate towards college students, your request to Brahmacharis to do college preaching — my college SIES Sion West Junior College was first — Radhanath Prabhu now Srila Bhakti Rasamrita Swami Maharaj started coming to our college. He took our care like spiritual parents \u0026 introduced us to you, Maharaj.\n\nHe started arranging programs at Mr. Murlidhar P. And Adikeshav P.\u0027s house. I was impressed by your speech — your clarity about God, dedication to spiritualism, and strong desire to spread Krishna Consciousness in youth, college students.\n\nIn 1995 I was selected for initiation. I was scared about initiation because my parents were unaware of my Krishna Consciousness and how I would deal with them. I said to my Shiksha Guru that I don’t want to take initiation...\nThat day I went home and I was deeply thinking about initiation. I came to a decision that I should take initiation.\nNext day I came to Radha Gopinath temple and I heard your Bhagavatam class. I wanted to say to you that I want to take initiation, but I was worried that my name must have been canceled from the list. I was roaming around your room. You saw me and said, “Do you want to say something?”\n\nI said yes. I told you all that had happened at home, how I had decided to take initiation. Then you asked me, “How old is your father?” I said, “47 years.” You just laughed and said, “I am also 47 years; I am your spiritual father.”\nYour name is not canceled.\n\nI am very thankful to you that you have accepted me as your spiritual daughter.\n\nYou are very concerned about me.\nYou guided me in the proper way at the proper time.\n\nIn 1996, I went for Navadvip Mandal Parikrama as a doctor. There, one grihastha devotee told me to come to Mayapur and stay with them — they needed an allopathic doctor.\n\nAfter coming, you asked me how was seva. Then I told you about this. You said, “You be here.”\n\nWhen we shifted to Parbhani, you wrote a letter that you are going for a different mission.\n\nIn 1997 at Parbhani I got a dream that you had come to my place, giving darsana. I had made arrangements for everybody. You said, “I will come one day; make nice arrangements.”\n\nNice arrangements are preaching, and since that time, we have been preaching and assisting your mission.\nI am praying at your lotus feet for serving in Srila Prabhupada’s mission as a servant of servants.\nएस्से प्रसादात भगवत प्रसाद एस अ प्रसादात न.गतिकुतोपे ध्यास तू वाशस्वी यशस्वी संध्या वंदे गुरु श्री चरणारविंद\nYour Insignificant servant\nSarveshwari devi dasi"

You want to see how Krishna becomes the center of our activities slowly and steadily.\n\nIn the early formative years, you took personal care of our family, spending time and giving us your association and krupa. This left a lasting impression on everyone at home and extended families. Maharaj, you would go out of your way to meet us and slowly planted the seed of bhakti. This gave us an opportunity to uplift us from the rut of the material world.\n\nAfter that, the Lord made all arrangements. It is said that we take one step, and the Lord takes a hundred.

Kindly pull me out of this darkness, accept me as your servant, and mercifully engage me in your service always.\nI do not know how to please Sri Krishna and Srimati Radharani. My heart is still filled with impurities. The seed of devotion is there, but I have no strength to nourish it. Please awaken within my heart genuine love for the Vaishnavas, humility, a mood of service, and an intense longing for constant remembrance of the Lord.\nBy observing your character, your compassion, and your pure devotion, I get a glimpse of how true bhakti should be. Yet I remain far away only because of my own disqualification. Gurudev, please bestow upon me even a single particle of the dust of your lotus feet—for in that alone lies my real welfare.\nOn this most sacred occasion of your 75th Vyasa puja, I earnestly pray that firm and unwavering devotion unto your lotus feet may awaken within my heart. May my mind be forever absorbed in your divine instructions, and may every breath, every action, and every moment of my life be wholly dedicated to your service and to bringing pleasure to Lord Sri Krishna. May I remain always under your loving guidance, serving with sincerity, gratitude, and unwavering commitment.\nYour servant,\nCompletely dependent on your mercy—\nSatish Pal\""

I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to glorify you even with my imperfect words. Every year, out of your causeless mercy, you give fallen souls like me the chance to speak something about you... though I know it is like showing a lamp to the sun or offering water to the ocean, still, Guru Maharaj, by your mercy, my words become free… my heart becomes free… and somehow, you allow me to express the gratitude I carry within.\n Thank you Maharaj for organizing Kartik yatra every year. This 2025 Kartik Yatra to Govardhan was my first ever yatra in my Krishna Consciousness till now. And Maharaj, during this Kartik Yatra, something happened that left a deep mark on my heart. On the fourth or the fifth day of your lecture, you mentioned that the highest goal of our life is to please the hearts of the Brajvasis and the pure devotees of the Lord.\n I heard the words… but the next day, Krishna allowed me to experience them. It was Śrīla Prabhupāda’s disappearance day. We were doing Vraja parikrama, singing kīrtan, exhausted and thirsty. We stopped for sugarcane juice, and someone said, “Till the juice prepares, let us do some kīrtan.” So softly we began:\n “Rādhe Rādhe Govinda, Govinda Rādhe…”\n Suddenly, from somewhere, a group of Brajvasis - elderly women and devotees from various Gaudiya parivāras - came and became completely ecstatic. Their joy overflowed into us, and our small kīrtan transformed into a powerful, joyful festival of hearts.\n What to speak of those elderly women, even the sugarcane juice walla, street vendors, everyone became ecstatic.\n After kīrtan, those matajis came to bless us, with such wholehearted affection, with so many blessings, like a child loves pampers and blesses with her hands, that my heart felt full to overflowing. In that moment, I felt we had truly pleased the hearts of the Brajvasis. Your words were not a lesson anymore; they were a living reality. That blessing filled me with a sweetness I cannot describe. I never experienced that moment ever before.\n \n Those two minutes…………\n Maharaj, due to some unavoidable circumstances, I joined the yatra a little late. On the very first morning japa, when I saw you a few steps ahead, I completely froze. For years I had only seen you online, and there you were, close, breathing the same air. I didn’t know what to do; my words left me. The whole yatra felt like a dream after that.\n All through the days I kept trying to get a moment with you, to offer my feelings, my realizations, my gratitude, but it seemed impossible. On the last day, I prayed with all my heart: “Maharaj, even for a few seconds, please let me offer what I brought for you.” I had brought some mahāprasād from Ayodhya as my offering. It looked like it would not be possible.\n But, but by your mercy, you came right in front of me. I was speechless, shaking, unable to say even the simplest thing: “Maharaj, I brought an offering for you.”\n You looked at me for complete 2 minutes, you spoke something, and those two minutes, just two minutes of your presence and attention, became the best two minutes of my life.\n I will carry them forever.\n After the yatra ended, I could not stay in the dhāma even for a moment. I felt an unbearable separation, not just from you but from the devotees who had become my family. Many of them I had met only online before. Meeting them offline felt not like a first meeting but like a homecoming; it felt as if I belong to them and they belong to me. Their warmth, their mercy, their blessings, I do not have words. Being with them made my Krishna consciousness bloom; leaving them made my heart ache. Truly:\n In your lectures I have heard that “we can only experience the real depth, real beauty of Krishna Consciousness in the association of devotees.”\n Also Bhagwatam describes: “bhaktis tu bhagavat-bhakta-saṅgena parijāyate.”\n “Devotional service to the Supreme Lord is awakened and nourished only by the association of His devotees.”\n And I really felt that. The separation was unbearable to such an extent that I really didn’t want to stay for even some minutes, that too in the Dham.\n \n Maharaj, once I heard your lecture where you said that “expressing gratitude is the womb of humility.” Those words remained in my heart, but during the yatra I saw them come alive through your own example. The way you thanked every devotee, every sevak, every organizer with such affection, respect, and sincerity, it felt as if you were personally teaching us how a true Vaiṣṇava honours everyone around him.\n Seeing that, Guru Maharaj, awakened a deep desire in me. I pray that one day I may develop even a tiny particle of the gratitude and humility that you embody so effortlessly. Inspired by your words, during the yatra I tried consciously to express gratitude to the devotees around me. And in those moments, I felt something changing within... as if a softer, more humble part of my heart was being uncovered by your mercy.\n Maharaj, whatever transformation begins in me is only because of your instructions. I pray that I may follow this teaching of yours more deeply, so that even in my small attempts, I may bring some glory to you and your mission.\n And thank you, Maharaj, for blessing us with your wonderful [messengers], His Grace Radheshyam Prabhu and His Grace Vaishnav Sharan Prabhu. Whatever I have today in my Krishna consciousness, it is by standing under the shade of their guidance. Many times, their corrections felt heavy, but later I understood they were actually saving me from myself.\n Especially the association of Vaishnav Sharan Prabhu, I learned how gentle, how personal, and how affectionate, how caring a devotee can be.\n Guru Maharaj, through these two devotees, I feel your mercy constantly flowing toward me. Their presence in my life is one of the greatest gifts you have given me.\n Oh Maharaj…\n During this yatra, I made some promise at your lotus feet. But today, honestly, I am still struggling to live that promise fully. My determination is weak, my habits pull me down, and my mind keeps distracting me.\n So on this auspicious day, I beg you for just one boon:\n Please bless me with the strength, enthusiasm, purity, and sincerity\n to fulfill the promise I made to you\n so I can serve you and your devotees in the best way possible.\n This one more, this year, gift I want from you.\n This is the only gift I want to offer back to you.\n \n One of your most, most, most, most insignificant servant\n Satyam Gupta\n Ayodhya"

        "country":  "India",
        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances,\n \n Although I have been hearing your lectures for many days, it was only after reading your book The Journey Home that I truly understood who you are and how you think. It deeply inspired me, and I could relate to it in many ways. Your childhood experiences, natural simplicity, humility, faith in the Supreme Lord — even during a time when you did not yet know who the Supreme God is — all these things astonished me. For the first time, I felt that someone’s thought process resonated so strongly with my own heart.\n \n It is only because of you that I took Krishna Consciousness seriously. From you, I learned the true importance of devotional service in my life. My faith in Srila Prabhupada and the process he has given has grown steadily simply by hearing you, observing you, and reading the philosophy through your lectures. Your lectures have become my life and soul. Even though my memory is short and not very sharp, and I cannot grasp deep philosophical points easily, your teachings give me clear direction about what to do and what to avoid in order to progress. Even though I fail many times due to my anarthas, it is your guidance that gives me the way forward.\n \n I am often amazed how Srila Prabhupada’s lectures, your lectures, and my daily book reading all revolve around the same points. This indicates to me that your mercy is bringing the blessings of the entire Guru Parampara into my life, despite my fallen condition.\n \n Through your lectures, I learned how miserable the material world is and how essential it is for every sādhaka to have a proper plan for leaving this world. But that was just the beginning. As your lectures progressed level by level, I was gradually introduced to deeper aspects of Krishna Consciousness — from the basics of body and soul, to devotional service, our relationship with God, spiritual emotions and pastimes, and later even more advanced topics like devotee care, rasa, and complete sacrifice. At first it felt overwhelming, like giving a heavy feast to someone with a weak digestion. But with the guidance of my superiors — who are your mercy agents through the counsellor system you established — I continued. Slowly my conviction developed, my faith increased, and I could digest these teachings and understand the real picture.\n \n Gradually, I realized the great danger of Vaiṣṇava-aparādha, the importance of offering respect to others, the formula for avoiding offenses through tṛṇād api sunīcena, the necessity of prayer, the tendency to take things cheaply and how to overcome it, and how Supersoul guides us at every moment if we learn to hear Him. This journey of hearing your lectures and being introduced to different aspects of bhakti has been truly adventurous, and for me it still continues with the same excitement. I pray that I may receive more and more shelter of your vani, and by your mercy understand how you want me to serve you, Srila Prabhupada, and the devotees.\n \n You are known for your exemplary behavior — your sadacara. Your dealings with your Godbrothers, senior disciples, junior disciples, and followers teach us how to behave in devotee association and how to care for others by bringing them closer to Krishna. Whatever you speak in your lectures, you follow perfectly in your conduct. It is said that one cannot become a perfect guru without first being a perfect disciple. The way you followed Srila Prabhupada’s teachings and engaged others in the same is a shining example.\n \n From the very beginning, I feared taking things cheaply, because I had that tendency. But I never wanted that in spiritual life. Your lectures always emphasize quality over quantity, and using quantity to eventually improve quality. You constantly teach how to remain conscious in every activity — not mechanical in service, sadhana, or relationships — and how to put our full heart and soul into everything we do. You teach attention to detail, serving not for show but for purification, and aiming for Krishna-prema.\n \n When someone asked you which is the highest level of devotee, everyone expected you to quote tṛṇād api sunīcena, yet you quoted āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ…. Your lectures always focus on pure devotional service — nothing less. Still, you wonderfully engage all types of people in Krishna Consciousness. How your lectures satisfy such a variety of hearts according to their level of realization is a mystery for me.\n \n In every aspect, your message remains the same: aim for quality with full consciousness — performing sadhana without pride, serving with humble servant-of-servant mood, remaining grateful, not judging or comparing, giving our best in every situation, never compromising in sadhana, and realizing Krishna through humble service rather than merely speaking about Him. These are the teachings I am striving to follow.\n \n One of your greatest blessings upon me is giving me shelter of the leaders trained by you — HG RSP, HG CCP, HG Gauranga Prabhu, my counsellor, and many others. They are your mercy agents, constantly guiding and protecting fallen souls like me. Through them you care for me in every aspect, especially in overcoming pride. Whatever little effort I am making comes from the inspiration you have given through your lectures.\n \n The importance of prayer has changed my life. It has made me more dependent on the Lord and the devotees. Through prayer, I realized the significance of our eternal prayer — the Holy Name. Recently I have begun trying to chant not only with clarity externally but with heartfelt shelter internally. As HH Bhakti Rasamrita Swami Maharaj often mentions, your two topmost instructions are:\n \n 1. Always serve everyone in the mood of servant of the servant.\n 2. Take complete shelter of the Holy Name with your whole heart.\n \n These are the gifts you have given me through your vani.\n \n I pray at your lotus feet that I may follow your instructions exactly as you have given them, without compromise. Please remain with me always through your teachings and continue to guide me. Kindly forgive all my offenses to you and to your devotees. Thank you for transforming my life completely. Thank you for giving me shelter again and again.\n In short — thank you for everything.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Saurabh D"

You descended to this world only for our benefit—to deliver us and take us back home, back to Krishna.\nWhen I read your book *The Journey Home* in 2017, during the very early days of my Krishna consciousness, I accepted you as my Guru in my heart, even though I did not yet understand what it truly meant to accept a spiritual master. Since then, you have continuously shown me the path—especially during my lowest phases in bhakti. You have never left me alone, because you know that without your mercy, I could not move forward.\n\nBy your mercy, I received the association of wonderful devotees in Richmond, from whom I have learned so much. Even now, I am surrounded by loving devotees who continue to inspire and teach me.\n\nGuru Maharaj, as I am growing and learning more about how this movement began and how it continues, my gratitude toward Srila Prabhupada and his disciples deepens more and more.\nWhenever I visit New Vrindavan and see the beautiful temple and facilities, my heart fills with joy. But when I hear about your sacrifices—how you served there in the early days when there were hardly any facilities—my heart overflows with love, respect, and gratitude for you. What you have done for us is beyond repayment.\n\nMy only prayer to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath is to bless you with good health, so that you may continue to share the divine love that has the power to transform the whole world.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nShaili Ghosh"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Words are too feeble to glorify such an exalted personality as yourself, and moreover, I have no qualification to do so. Yet, for the pleasure of the devotees and out of my own longing, I am making this humble attempt. Please forgive me for any offenses I may commit while doing so.\n \n Maharaj, you are the very embodiment of utmost humility, gratitude, and compassion. Your sense of servitude is beyond imagination; every gesture, every action expands it manifold, reaching across hearts and lifetimes. There could be no greater inspiration than to see such a living example before us.\n \n Your dedication and deep sense of indebtedness to Srila Prabhupada are truly exemplary. This inspires me greatly. In almost every lecture, you effortlessly invoke Srila Prabhupada with such grace and natural devotion, that it increases our gratitude both toward Srila Prabhupada and toward your own divine stature.\n \n Personally, my life has been deeply influenced by you. Beyond offering guidance in various aspects of life, your lectures have been answers to some of the most important questions I struggled with. They have guided my path and have helped place me in a much more meaningful and spiritually grounded position now. Maharaj, I cannot thank you enough, nor can I ever repay even a fraction of the inconceivable mercy you have bestowed upon me.\n \n When I was in darkness, your lectures brought light and hope. When I was in pain, they became a soothing balm. When I was in deep distress, they nurtured me like a mother’s embrace. When I had lost trust in the people around me, your words rekindled faith and steadiness within.\n \n Although I have not always been able to fully follow your instructions, especially to view adversity as the Lord’s opportunity for surrender and growth in bhakti, I sincerely tried my best. Simply by placing faith in your words, I was able to pass through some of the darkest nights of my life. Looking back now, I see clearly how your loving guidance has sustained, protected, and uplifted me. It is solely by your mercy that I am able to perform even the smallest efforts in bhakti—efforts that were once impossible for me.\n \n It is also by your mercy that I have received the companionship of my husband, who cares for me so beautifully and who has further strengthened my surrender and devotion to Srila Prabhupada and his mission.\n \n Maharaj, we sincerely beg for your continued mercy so that we may serve Srila Prabhupada’s mission. We have no qualification and many anarthas, yet we deeply desire to offer whatever little service we can. We know that we can never repay even a single drop of what Srila Prabhupada has given us, but we earnestly wish to dedicate our lives to him—and this is only possible through your empowerment. We depend solely on your mercy.\n \n Maharaj, please continue to bless us. We truly need it—more and more.\n \n Lastly, I always look forward to Karthik Yatra. Every moment of it is so precious, and it has created a profound and lasting impact within my heart—something I will cherish throughout my lifetime. Thank you once again for this immeasurable gift.\n \n I wanted to write so much more. I waited for the right mood and the right time, but it simply did not come. And today, the final day for submission, somehow I have been able to write something. Please accept it as it is.\n \n Very, very grateful to you, Maharaj, for all that you have done for all of us.\n Your insignificant servant,\n Shalini"

Just taking a moment in remembering you fills the heart of everyone with great joy just as a spirit soul hankering for krsna’s love is at once completely satisfied. Because you carry Krsna in your heart very strongly and You carry pure devotees who carry krsna in their hearts like Srila Prabhupada. In the recent Govardhan Yatra I was just stunned to see your overwhelming gratitude for your Guru Maharaj, it was an incessant flow of love and gratitude outpouring from your heart in a genuine way. When will I develop such feelings for my spiritual master!!! Far way to go, yet you are so merciful. Although I keep forgetting time and again what I have received You always remind me through your lectures and example and through your true representatives. Your Vani and example are my only shelter. It is said the Instruction of a Spiritual master is the greatest form of mercy for a disciple, and those who follow them with their body mind words and their very lives always live with him. Thankyou so much Gurudev for bestowing us with your invaluable instructions. Its more than a lifetime project to follow your instructions to-to. Some of the senior devotees approached you to seek some instructions for all the disciples on this special 75th Vyaspuja, and You replied:\n 1. Please go deep into hearing, chanting and service.\n 2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Krishna.\n 3. Strive to be united as a community.\n 4. Practice enthusiasm to share Bhakti - Krishna Consciousness.\n 5. Never forget that Bhakti is not about quantity or numerical, but it is about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n \"I will say the same whether it is 25th birthday or 50th or 75th.\"\n Each and every instruction I see is only to bring us more closer to eternal truth and nothing for your self. The 10 instructions that you have given for the Brahmacharis are so famous, I wish to strive my best to follow each of these to please you. One of the very important instructions is NEVER CRITICISE anyone no matter whatever or whoever they are!! I can personally observe this disease of criticism being deeply rooted in my heart, in my thoughts words and dealings. Very difficult to overcome this tendency no matter how many times I try. It is all because I’m not humble at all, I feel myself to be somewhere better. But Gurudev, You are expert in making anyone whether it is your God brother or any insignificant being like a small calf feel special by fanning their original identity which is so great and by your genuine appreciation. You emphasise in every lecture trinadapi sunicena…and you are a living example for it. That’s why you attract so many people’s love. Please give me strength Gurudev to become genuine and free from criticism for anyone. \n In this recent yatra You have given your fullest mercy to everyone. How you reciprocated with Brajvasis on the stage, with all the common devotees, with the senior devotees, and with all the sevaks at various levels is simply amazing. And especially your lectures were even more special, they were filled with many of the acharya’s and your’s vraja prema. Kirtans were filled with enthusiasm and eagerness to take shelter of Holy names deeply, it transported us to a different realm. A very special opportunity for unlimited seva for all sevaks to make tremendous advancement by serving 1000s of devotees at a time. Thank you so much Gurudev for everything. You boost us in the yatras and then again continue to do in the communities where we are sheltered by your decades of endeavor. I’m going on receiving so much but practically doing nothing to please you. \n There are many devotees who follow your instructions with great care and attention one Example is HG Vikram Gauranga Pr free from criticism always with great maturity dealing with concern for everyone. Our communities have such shining examples to remind me constantly your mood and mission. Sometimes some of the newly upcoming devotees of our student center also are much better in this aspect. I have been given this exalted service to counsel and care for their krsna consciousness but I’m not qualified. Only to please my superiors I’m trying to render this service. My only hope is just help them take shelter of your vani and example and that will surely groom them to success on this path of krsna consciousness. Guru Maharaj, Please bless me that one day I become a worthy disciple of yours following the footsteps of your exemplary disciples, try to shoulder your burden instead of becoming a burden. \n \n Your insignificant Servant\n Sharad Purnima Das"

I am feeling very fortunate to express my gratitude and thanks on this auspicious occasion of your Vyaspuja today.\n \n In the year 2017, I met ISKCON devotees and enrolled for spiritual sessions. When I was in my 2nd year of college, my seniors guided me to hear your lectures. Being very new, I had very meager knowledge about Krishna consciousness. I was able to understand Krishna conscious philosophy very easily just by hearing your lectures at that time. Your profound knowledge and realizations deeply touched my heart in the ongoing journey of my spiritual life. Although I haven’t received your direct association, but by devotees\u0027 mercy, I have been attending Kartik yatras. Due to that, at least once a year I am able to get your association. So many unheard pastimes of Krishna and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu you used to describe with full ecstasy and derive important lessons for us to follow. Your analogies, real-life examples, and realizations inspire me a lot.\n \n You have explained your whole spiritual journey in the book ‘The Journey Home,’ which is very much inspiring to read, and I am aspiring for such sincerity and dedication to practice Krishna consciousness as shown by you. Over the years, your dedication to the mission of Srila Prabhupada has been increasing more and more. I saw more than 12,000 devotees attending yatra and cooperating with each other, being satisfied with whatever services they get, facilities they get, selflessly serving in the mega kitchen all day and night. Being very grounded to earth, your humility and selflessness touch people’s hearts. Although suffering from so many anarthas, I find great relief by hearing your lectures. In the coming year, I am planning to take out important instructions from your recorded lectures and transcripts and will try to follow sincerely.\n \n Please bless me, Gurudeva, to become a significant instrument in the hands of my authorities in the mission of Srila Prabhupada and practice Bhakti for the pleasure of Krishna without ulterior motive.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Shashank"

I literally have no words to express my gratitude to you for your unlimited compassion and encouragement, which you have made me to experience despite my being a wretched fellow in every way. I got some glimpses of what sort of oceanic sufferings I actually deserved due to my past and present sins, but as a perfect captain, you have navigated my very tiny and tender boat of so-called devotion in this vast ocean of my sinful reactions in such a way that now, at the present moment, at least physically, I am serving in Sridham Mayapur and experiencing the causeless mercy of the most merciful Lords Gauranga and Nityananda along with Their associates. For me, it is an inconceivable arrangement to experience this miracle despite my wretched conditions. Realizing the inconceivably causeless mercy upon an ignorant fool like me, I feel regretful for my inability to reciprocate with your mercy and thus make you happy. I am feeling very lonely because I have no qualities to attract the love and affection of devotees; rather, I am pushing them away through my uncultured, animalistic behavior, and worst is, I am not able to improve in my dealings with the Vaisnavas who are gifted to me by you. In this way, due to my offenses, now I am surrounded by misfortune and have become a hopeless case, fully depending on your causeless mercy and merciful guidance, and I have no other hope. Please deal with me in whatever way you feel happy, because my useless life belongs to you, and I am sure that, as an expert transcendental sculptor, you will carve Krishna out of my hard materialistic life and will reveal to me Krishna\u0027s name, form, qualities, His associates, His abode, His paraphernalia, etc., and my relationship with them, and accordingly engage me to give pleasure to the Divine Couple, which will be the perfection of my existence, even though I am a most undeserving candidate. Thank you for everything which you have bestowed upon me. Kindly bestow qualifications also to reciprocate with your mercy.\nPlease forgive me for my sinful and offensive behaviors and kindly continue to guide me.\n\nAspiring to be your humble obedient puppet,\nAspiring to be your insignificant humble servant,\nShashikant\nISKCON Mayapur"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Gurumaharaj\nPlease accept my humble obeisance unto your lotus feet.\n\nOh Gurumaharaj, please accept me as your degraded aspiring servant. I\u0027m very thankful and grateful to you, Gurumaharaj, for everything you have given me. Oh Gurumaharaj, the day I was hearing about your humility towards devotees, your Godbrother, and even towards your disciples, I was shocked. I just say sorry to you, Gurumaharaj, that I\u0027m not able to follow as you say, \"to be humbler than a blade of grass\" due to my lust, anger, and envy. Please forgive me for that, Gurumaharaj, but I promise soon I will become humbler than a blade of grass.\n\nAnd thank you very much, Gurumaharaj, for giving me your personal service in this Mahakumbh, and also thank you very much. By your mercy, I got the opportunity to associate and even did service with many of your senior disciples, and also got to know each other, get to know about you more by your disciples. And the main thing is that you have shown me mercy in the kitchen by touching my shoulder and then my head, and also I got a chance to quickly touch your lotus feet, and after that, I got a chance to take your maha maha prasad and wash your dishes and take prasad with the senior-most Godbrother. I just want to say that this Mahakumbh is very memorable for me because I got an opportunity to serve you. Although many of your disciples want to serve you, you chose me to serve. \"THANK YOU SOO MUCH GURUMAHARAJ.\"\n\nThen your mercy worked like that. When I started coming to the temple, I saw many devotees going to Vrindavan, Mathura, but I couldn\u0027t. Even when I chanted 16 rounds for one year, then I thought, \"Now I got a chance to go with devotees,\" but then also I couldn\u0027t go. I was literally very sad that a server devotee is going, why am I not going? Even that devotee is going who came to the temple after me, who didn\u0027t chant 16 rounds also. I was literally very sad, Gurumaharaj. But then, on the day of the Kumbh Mela, I got mercy from you. After that, one week later, a devotee who is serving in the kitchen in sector 6 Netra Kumbh finished his service, and he made a plan to go to Vrindavan suddenly. And I literally thought, \"Then all these people will go, and I won\u0027t be able to go.\" Then I helped him in shifting his luggage from the mela to the temple, and after that, we made a plan to take a bath in the Sangam with all 5-6 devotees. Actually, that day, one devotee came from Chowpatty, HG Subal Pran Prabhuji, for some arrangements for his congregation yatra to Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, and Ayodhya. So I was with him from morning till evening in searching for hotels for devotees who were coming in the yatra. So we took a bath in the Sangam. After that, that devotee told me to come with him to Vrindavan, and I was like, \"How will we go on such short notice?\" And he asked me at 8 pm, and the train timing was 11 pm. I told him that my parents were not allowed. So he said, \"I\u0027ll talk to them.\" But I knew that my parents were not allowed. But now your mercy started working. I don\u0027t know, but after hearing, they simply said okay, and I was shocked. The plan was made at 8 pm, and my parents were ready to allow me to board the train at 11 pm. Now, from that day, I realized, \"Without the mercy of Guru, you can\u0027t reach Vrindavan.\"\n\"THANK YOU SOO MUCH GURUMAHARAJ.\"\n\nAnd now you have also allowed me to attend the Kartik Yatra at Sri Govardhan Dham, which was my dream to serve in the kitchen with devotees, dance in kirtan which was led by you, and hear class regularly from you. And now we have also planned to come to your Vyaspuja celebration at GEV, which is called the Festival of Gratitude. And also, after your mercy, I got many services in the temple like Yamuna Aarti and deity worship. Although there are many chaos also, sometimes misunderstandings happen between devotees.\n\nSo I just want to pause here because I want to write many more also, but I think it\u0027s too long. I don\u0027t want to waste your time. If you are reading this, I just want to say an extremely big thank you to you for everything, and a huge thank you to Srila Prabhupada for giving me you as my spiritual father. \"PLEASE ACCEPT ME.\"\nTHANK YOU SOO MUCH GURUMAHARAJ.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nShashwat"

He often reminds us that a true leader is one who creates other leaders, and by his warmth, care, and deep concern for every soul, he inspires devotees to lead and uplift others with sincerity and love.\n Guru Maharaj leads not by authority, but by empowerment, humility, and unconditional compassion. His presence gives courage, his words give direction, and his love gives purpose. He teaches us that real leadership in Krishna consciousness means becoming an instrument of Krishna’s mercy for the upliftment of all.\n Guru Maharaj’s pure character and divine qualities touch the hearts of all who meet him. Even a gentle smile, folded hands, or a loving embrace reflects the bhāva of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and speaks more powerfully than words.\n \n Unmatched Humility, Love, and Personal Care\n \n Guru Maharaj’s humility, love, and care touch the hearts of everyone. He is deeply personal in his dealings, showing genuine affection and attention to each devotee.\n His every word and action reflect pure love flowing from a heart filled with devotion and compassion.\n \n Realised and Revealed Lectures\n \n Guru Maharaj’s lectures are truly heart-touching and completely eye-opening. His simple yet profound analogies give instant strength and clarity, helping me understand what a genuine bhakta really means.\n One analogy that deeply touched my heart is that of the solar panel. Just as a solar panel absorbs the light of the sun and then gives that same light for the benefit of others, in the same way, a devotee must first absorb spiritual strength by sincerely receiving the mercy of the Lord and Guru. Only then can he share that light with the world.\n A solar panel has no ego. It knows that it is not the source of energy; it simply receives and gives. Similarly, if we want to offer something meaningful and uplifting to others, we must first fill our hearts with something higher—devotion, purity, and spiritual wisdom. We can only give what we have truly received. By Guru Maharaj’s teachings, I pray to become a humble instrument to carry and share even a small ray of that divine light.\n Encouraging True Absorption in Krishna Consciousness\n Guru Maharaj teaches us to practice Krishna consciousness with true absorption. He explains that real absorption means to tune our heart and mind while chanting, praying, and meditating. To absorb ourselves in spiritual life is to open our hearts to absorb the grace of the holy name, the grace of kirtan, the grace of the Lord, and the grace found in sincere prayers.\n A Storehouse of Divine Qualities By Hg Rukmini Krishna Prabhu Ji\n \n Guru Maharaj is a true reservoir of divine qualities. His humility, simplicity, and purity of heart naturally attract everyone. When he speaks Hari-katha or describes the pastimes of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, those divine moments feel present and alive, as if the spirit of Mahaprabhu’s movement is flowing through his words, kirtan, and compassionate dealings with all.\n Despite empowering and guiding so many wonderful leaders within the movement, Guru Maharaj remains completely humble and detached, always seeing himself as a servant of the Vaishnavas. His character and devotion remind us that true greatness is measured not by position, but by the depth of one’s love and surrender.\n \n A Loving and Genuine Glorification of Devotee Service\n \n I witnessed this beautiful nature of Guru Maharaj during the Kartik Yatra 2025 in Govardhan. While speaking Hari-katha, Guru Maharaj lovingly glorified every devotee engaged in service. One statement touched my heart deeply—he said that the kitchen devotees are not merely cooking to feed others, but are sharing a love-feast, offering devotion through every detail of their preparation.\n He mentioned how some Matajis were making nearly 20,000 chapatis by hand, serving tirelessly from 4:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. for all five days of the yatra. Guru Maharaj expressed that in the holy abode of Govardhan, the Lord is watching their service, and that such loving service is never futile. Every small act done to please the devotees brings great joy to the Supreme.\n Complete Faith and Surrender to Guru and Krishna\n \n In every lecture and in his daily life, Guru Maharaj remains absorbed in a mood of transcendental devotion. In his kathā and kīrtan, we can feel his genuine gratitude to Srila Prabhupāda, his loving respect for the Deities and the Holy Name, and his unwavering surrender to Guru and Krishna.\n Guru Maharaj’s love is not limited to humans—he sees all living beings as parts and parcels of Krishna and extends his affection to everyone. During the Govardhan Yatra, Guru Maharaj beautifully shared that the Vrindavan mood is not “I and Me”, but “We and Us”—the mood of the Brajavasis, who live only to please Sri Sri Radha and Krishna and to spread this spirit of loving cooperation.\n \n With deepest regards,\n [Your Name]"

You are the only person for whom I have genuinely felt devotion and taken courage to serve, just by your mercy.\n Gurudev, I have planned to achieve my career goals for your pleasure and devotional service. Please guide and bless me.\n Gurudev, I want to serve my family to serve you and to serve Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Please forgive me, Gurudev. I missed attending Kartik yatra of 2025. I missed you and all the Vaishnav sanga. Gurumaharaj, I was continuously remembering KY 2024 when I was there with all of you. I felt so blessed. I felt very bad that I was sleeping in your classes due to tiredness and loneliness. I feel very bad that we did not have any mentor with us who could take care of us.\n Gurudev, due to family responsibilities, I am unable to attend this year because I had not the financial power to render service to my family for my Bhakti life. Gurumaharaj, sometimes I think, \"I am born in a poor, orphaned, illiterate girl\u0027s body. I have no potential to serve you. I have no contacts, no family, no one near! So, will you ignore me? Will you reject me?\" But I have no one who can guide me as a coach to become your disciple. I am feeling so unsheltered.\n Gurumaharaj, by the mercy of Krishna, one guide came into my life. He is HH Loknath Swami Maharaj\u0027s sincere, devoted disciple. He inspired me to be strong and prioritize my Bhakti life.\n Gurumaharaj, I thought to serve the GEV project. I thought to teach my children Bhaktiyoga from their very young life. Please bless me that I can do everything for your service.\n In your devotional separation,\n Your aspiring insignificant servant,\n Shivani Nandini Aambedare."

I pray to you that I may be able to absorb your qualities, discover myself and this Krishna consciousness in a better way, not be lazy, be able to serve Srila Prabhupada, and be rest assured about Krishna\u0027s mercy through the holy name.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, with great personal trouble, has given the most valuable purports to the scriptures of our Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Sampradāya.\n \n In the purport to an important verse for all Prabhupādānugas, Srimad-Bhagavatam Canto 1, Chapter 2, Verse 17, Srila Prabhupada says, “The Lord is more anxious to take us back into His kingdom than we can desire.”\n \n Such is the nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth who is being revealed by this most exalted paramparā! To be served and loved by every willing soul. This one instruction alone gives great hope to all conditioned souls who are perpetually suffering in the material world.\n \n On this auspicious day, kindly accept our heartfelt gratitude to you for your most sublime instructions, which attract us, bestow valuable faith upon us, and which give us entrance into Srila Prabhupada’s Līlāmṛta.\n \n Following in your divine footsteps and your exemplary life of service to Srila Prabhupada’s instructions, we are aspiring to commit ourselves to eternal servitude in the mission of Srila Prabhupada, and to share the message of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu with the entire world.\n \n On this most auspicious day, I wish to offer my body, mind, and my very self at your divine lotus feet, to be used, as you desire, in your service to Srila Prabhupada; no matter what it takes, no matter what price has to be paid.\n \n I am grossly unqualified and will eternally remain so. However, by your boundless mercy, which is far greater than all my faults and shortcomings, I beg from you to be accepted as your formally initiated disciple, and thus as an insignificant and menial servant of the servants of your servants.\n \n Considering myself a neophyte fool, I beg forgiveness for my offenses and mistakes. And thus, I humbly offer this prayer, seeking your compassionate mercy upon this fallen, conditioned soul.\n \n \n An unfortunate, insignificant beggar,\n Shreyas Zingre"

It was indeed a very rare and most treasured moment of my life to have the opportunity to associate with and hear katha along with thousands of devotees.\n \n I also felt very fortunate to attend the Bhagavatam class at Radha Gopinath Temple just before the Kartik Yatra, wherein you mentioned, \"Sometimes we take for granted the opportunities we get. But the fact is that there is danger at every step. Challenges beyond our control can come at any time. It is very rare to get an opportunity to hear Bhagavatam, to pray, to meditate, to chant the holy names.\" Every statement made me deeply reflect upon my life. I am very grateful to you, Maharaja, for making me reflect and appreciate the opportunity to have been given a chance to hear directly from you in the association of the wonderful family of devotees.\n \n You often mention the principle of *samsiddhir hari tosanam* — the true glory of life is simply to please Krishna in every moment by making the right choice in whatever situation comes upon us—honor or dishonor, pleasure or pain, happiness or distress, victory or defeat, success or failure, health or disease. I pray at your lotus feet on this auspicious day to bestow upon me the divine intelligence and determination of my will to make the right choice at every moment to please Krishna.\n \n On this most auspicious day of your divine appearance, I would like to recommit to my vows of initiation. Kindly grant me the strength to sincerely and strictly follow my sacred vows of initiation for the rest of my life: chanting a minimum of 16 rounds on beads and following the four regulative principles—no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling, and no illicit sex. Please bestow upon me the strength to bear all trials and troubles and to free me from all desire for honor.\n \n Thank you, Guru Maharaja, for always extending your mercy in the form of your divine lectures and devotional kirtans.\n \n Your insignificant disciple,\n Shridhar Krishna Das"

You may have given lectures on the same topic hundreds of times, but still, you prepare.

Whether it was being a Pujari in New Vrindavan, or preaching in colleges, or setting up new temples in distant foreign lands. You gave your very best, in every situation, gratefully accepting with humility, all kinds of tribulations that came your way.\n\nUnderstanding Shrila Prabhupad’s heart, you have given us what he had envisioned to establish in society. Schools based on Vedic culture, Vrindavan in the form of Goverdhan Eco Village, Bhakti Vedanta Hospital, the Bhakti Vedanta Hospice, midday meal programs, and so many other schemes, where, along with the body, the soul is also nourished.\n\nYou have shown us by your example, how one should surrender to the will and instructions of one\u0027s spiritual master.\n\nWhere preaching is concerned, you have actually expanded the concept of preaching to extraordinary dimensions, through your disciples.\nRight from establishing the counseling system for the devotee community, conducting valued education classes in schools, preaching to the youth, preaching to the corporate sector, preaching in villages, preaching internationally, preaching on social media... today ISKCON has become a household name, thanks to your visionary thinking and efforts in that direction.\n\nYou have given us the essence of Scriptures through your books and lectures, and these are our real shelter as we navigate ourselves through life’s difficult turns.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I have received so much from you in terms of spiritual wealth, much, much more than I can ever repay in this lifetime.\nI have so many shortcomings and am most unqualified in so many ways. But probably, some day, some birth, by your mercy and the mercy of my godbrothers and sisters, I do hope to improve myself so that you are pleased.\n\nI beg for your mercy so that I may have the courage and determination to remember and follow your instructions, and be able to assist in Shrila Prabhupad\u0027s mission, even if it is in a very insignificant way, in the mood of a servant of your servants.\n\nI pray to Sri Sri Radha Kunjavihari and Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Chandra for your good health and long life, so that you continue to attract and inspire thousands of people to Krsna consciousness.\n\nMaharaj, thank you for everything.\n\nWith deepest gratitude and reverence,\nAn insignificant servant of your servants,\nShwetaganga Dasi.\n11/11/2925."

This moment will be cherished for my lifetime, Maharaj. Whenever I see you, my eyes get filled with tears by thinking how fortunate I am under your shelter. I am still in confusion on how to serve you, Maharaj. Day by day, I am getting more attached to you by hearing your glorifications by senior Vaishnavas. Whatever circumstances you faced in your life, still you look so humble and calm. How is that possible, Gurumaharaj? I am just trying to be humble and patient as much as possible. Please bless me, Gurumaharaj. I don\u0027t have any other hope without you in KC. My eyes are filling with tears, and I get goosebumps on my skin while hearing your Glorifications.

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nDear Gurudev,\nOn your 75th appearance day, we are blessed and honored to be able to participate in this celebration. For a devotee, there is nothing higher than the Vyasa puja of his spiritual master. It\u0027s the day that reminds us of the causeless mercy we have received at your lotus feet, and the day when we can reaffirm our vows to you. Over all these years as your disciple, I have become more and more aware of the sacrifices and the energy you expend for the deliverance of each disciple. This was apparent in your Kartik yatras, especially the last one this year, where every single lecture and kirtan was sublime and transcendental, elevating our consciousness to new highs. It was also apparent from the response from material nature recognizing the moment, curbing all distractions, especially rainfall, for the seven days of the yatra. We know that on the conclusion of the yatra, there was a fury of rain for two or more days at the location.\n\nThis very special Vyasa puja is an opportunity for me to reaffirm my complete surrender at your lotus feet with my life and soul. Your kindness and compassion to me, and to my entire family, is a cause for celebration and at the same time realization of our good fortune. I just sincerely desire to follow your example of complete dedication and surrender to your spiritual master. On this day, I pray for many more years of your personal association, and commit my life and soul to your instructions. Please be kind to us and continue to guide us to navigate through the intricacies of this material world, remaining focused on our values and our commitments in Krishna Consciousness.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nShyam Behari Das\nIskcon North Atlanta\nSuwanee, Georgia"

And I would like to beg Krsna for your good health and that you stay with us as long as possible, because I am very selfish, and so many people like me need you for our spiritual upliftment.\n Now, Maharaj, very recently, before this Govardhan Kartik yatra, I heard the audio \"Journey Home\" book directly in your holy voice. And this time it really touched my heart. Before, I also read it once, but long ago, maybe around 10 years before. But this time, when I heard it, every episode I was repeating at least twice.\n And after hearing about your journey, Maharaj, I was really thankful to Krsna that He sent you in this world just for delivering the fallen \u0026 unworthy souls like me. Otherwise, there was no other reason for you to come here in this world except for delivering us, Maharaj.\n How dear you are to Krsna, people like us cannot even imagine. That\u0027s why I beg at your lotus feet, Maharaj, beg for your blessings so that this fallen soul also can do something, at least, to please you and to please your Krsna, because Krsna is your property. And it is really you only who can make us also experience Krsna in our life. I am such an unworthy \u0026 rebellious soul that I have no feelings for pleasing Krsna \u0026 His devotees. Rather, I take so much pleasure in finding faults in devotees and committing so many offenses towards Krsna \u0026 devotees. In such a fallen condition of mine, there is no hope for me except your divine grace.\n You just came to deliver the fallen souls of this world, and I am not so humble that I can consider myself the most fallen, but in reality, I am. And in spite of being so, I am not ready to accept my actual situation of being so fallen. But your mercy is the only hope for me.\n And I have heard that the mercy of great souls like you is so powerful that it can very easily deliver the fallen souls like me.\n I am just trying to practice this process given by Srila Prabhupada and our glorious acharyas, just with this hope that someday I will also get the causeless mercy of Krsna coming through His sincere devotees like you, and then someday Krsna may use me also in any way He likes to use.\n \n Now, I am just a beggar at your lotus feet, Maharaj, a beggar for your causeless mercy. I have no sincerity, no qualification. The only thing is that I am just trying with my little efforts, and those also with no feelings, hoping for your causeless mercy someday.\n Your insignificant \u0026 fallen servant -\n shyam bhagwan das"

Our hearts fill with nectar.\n\nMaharaj nourishes us with his profound realizations and magnifies the Pastimes of the Lord and His devotees for us to relish the deeper meanings of those transcendental activities. Just by hearing about them, the pastimes start enacting in front of our eyes while he is narrating them.\n\nRecently, at the Kartik Yatra 2025, I couldn’t stop appreciating all the wonderful devotees who were serving tirelessly just to make our experience joyful, comfortable, and relishable. All this is due to you, Maharaj, because you always insist on serving others and you never get tired of teaching us to be humble; you truly believe and live that humility.\n\nThe Yatra was arranged in such a way that it was natural for one to be engaged in association, hearing, chanting, dancing, and feasting, thus becoming very satisfied and happy. I am eternally grateful for being able to participate and experience the bliss.\n\nIn your concluding lecture of the Yatra, you instructed us to read Srila Prabhupada’s books, take shelter of Holy Names in Japa and Kirtan seriously, and to follow the Teachings of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on how to be a devotee and spread the message to the World. To be more determined in our Sadhana and keep away from mundane activities, be the servant of the servant for the Pleasure of the Lord, and help Srila Prabhupada spread all over the world Param Vijayate Sankirtanam.\n\nYou ended your talk by encouraging us to take shelter of the Holy Names of the Lord and of Hari Katha, to share these teachings with the world in whatever capacity we can, and to be very kind to each other.\n\nYou always guide us to be attentive against offenses; you are always kind and understanding with utmost empathy for all of us.\n\nThank you very much for your mercy.

I followed some of them, and saw miraculous results. I can only imagine how much I will advance, and can serve your mission, if I can follow all your instructions properly. Guru Maharaj, I beg for your mercy - please bestow upon me the spiritual strength to be able to follow yours and Prabhupada\u0027s instructions properly. I beg to you for mercy that I always remain a humble servant of vaishnavas, improve in my sadhana, and be able to effectively reach out to other souls who are in need of Krishna Consciousness.\n Aspiring to be the servant of your servants,\n Shyam Dulal Das"

By the great mercy of the Lord we are fortunate to be able to get your association and learn the science of Bhakti from your divine words and your exemplary behavior.\n- Gurudev, the words coming from your mouth are very enlightening and help us to come out of our deep ignorance again and again. These are the beacon light for us which show us the way and also give us the inspiration to walk on the right path of pure devotional service. Your words give us the vision to see the world and act for the pleasure of Guru and Krishna. Also they give us so much hope and nourishment to go ahead in our spiritual journey although there may be so many obstacles in the path. So thank you for your association through your divine sound vibration.\n-Gurudev, you are an ocean of Vaishnava qualities such as humility, simplicity, gratitude, being so dedicated to the mission of Srila Prabhupada and so on. Not only you mention and glorify these qualities in the great devotees of the Lord but you live by and exemplify them through your own life. For example: we hear so many times in your classes about the verse “Trinadapi sunicena tarorapi sahisnuna….” And to me it appears so difficult, but when I see your exemplary life through the incidents mentioned in the book “The Journey Home” it becomes so clear what these qualities are.\n-Gurudev, your life helps us to understand what it means to be a seeker of the Lord and what it means to be a devotee. So thank you for the valuable association you are giving to us through your vapu and vani. It is because of your prayers that we are able to perform some little devotional service although struggling to come up to the standard.\nOn this auspicious day I want to beg you, Please:\n1 Gurudev, give to this servant just one drop of mercy. I am lower than a blade of grass. Give me all help. Give me strength. Let me be as you are, without desires and aspirations.\n2 I offer you all respects, for thus I may have the energy to know you correctly. Then by chanting the holy name in great ecstasy, all my offenses will cease.\n3 When will such mercy fall on this one who is weak and devoid of intelligence? Allow me to be with you.\n4 If you examine me, you will find no qualities. Your mercy is all that I am made of. If you are not merciful unto me, I can only weep and I will not be able to maintain my life.\nThank you very much.\nYour aspiring servant,\nShyam Jagannath das"

An acharya is one who teaches practically from his *achar*. And you are the crest jewel example of this. Gurudev, in every lecture, you stress the importance of chanting holy names, serving Vaishnavas in the mood of servant of servant of servant, and developing humility. And you personally teach by your own example. Dear Gurudev, you are so humble that you never look for any recognition and glorification. Outside people hanker so much for recognition, doing all sorts of crazy things to get viral, to get famous. But advanced devotees like you always look for serving maximum with minimum limelight. I\u0027m very, very deeply touched by this one quality of you, which is also seen in many of Srila Prabhupada\u0027s disciples: that everyone wants to just serve together just to please SRILA PRABHUPADA with no personal ambition. It\u0027s my greatest fortune to witness personalities like you in my lifetime. Because the only place where I have heard of such personalities is in scriptures like *Chaitanya Charitamrita* and *Srimad Bhagavatam*. Even in this age, when most people just retire to enjoy the fruit of their lifetime\u0027s hard work, although they\u0027re unable to do so properly because of their failing health, Gurudev, you are still extending more and more and more. Even when you take care of your health, you do it purely out of a service mood: \"How can I serve Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas more and more with this body?\" Generally, when someone does service which attracts the mercy of Mahabhagavats, then they get the mercy and blessings. But persons like me are *kripana* who don\u0027t even cry for mercy, although they are in most need of mercy. Even though I haven\u0027t done anything good which can attract your heart and mercy, save for doing all nonsense things, still you have accepted me. Your lectures are a radar for me. In your lecture, you said that initiation is the serious beginning responsibility of a *sadhaka*. While I feel unworthy to be called your disciple, but whatever I can do in the present situation as a responsible disciple of such an exalted spiritual master as you. I pray at your lotus feet that please never give up on me. Please chastise me, punish me, whenever I\u0027m wrong, but never reject me. I\u0027m always dependent on you. I seek your mercy and blessings that I become a better devotee, one who only wants to serve Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas and nothing else.\n\nInsignificant servant of your servants,\nShyam Jivan Das"

        "Your Offering ":  "My most worshipable Sri Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble and respectful obeisances unto your lotus feet.\n All glories to our beloved Srila Prabhupada and our Guru Maharaj.\n \n I am sincerely very grateful for your unlimited mercy and compassion. Almost 7 years ago, by your causeless mercy, I got the shelter of your blessed lotus feet. I am extremely fortunate to get this opportunity to present my Vyas Puja offerings on this blessed moment of the 75th appearance day of my Sri Guru Maharaj.\n \n Although all your words, lectures, and instructions are transcendental gems in my spiritual life, I would like to list a few 75 instructions and teachings which are the guiding principles for all of us:\n \n 1. Being loyal and faithful is the foundation of a disciple’s character.\n 2. Humility softens the heart and captures God’s heart.\n 3. A spiritual approach to life that is based on humility and service transforms even unknown servants to glorious recipients of Lord’s love and mercy.\n 4. When you are proud, you are already fallen; the rest is just details.\n 5. Take seriously the responsibilities given by your guru/Parampara — that is the basis of bhakti.\n 6. Accept that you are insignificant compared to the all-great Lord and His servants — this builds humility.\n 7. In giving respect, we can be very happy; expecting respect brings misery.\n 8. Collective unity is better than individual purity.\n 9. Real faith is awakened from within — not imposed externally.\n 10. If we judge devotees, it is our spiritual destruction.\n 11. Every word we speak or everything we do is either an offering to Krishna or our ego.\n 12. The disciple that pleases the guru is the one who can be depended upon: in all the situations and circumstances, he will be there.\n 13. Don’t take any service whimsically. If you are asked to change a life-boat, that changing is your path back to Godhead.\n 14. Serve with gratitude and enthusiasm — service is your connection to Krishna.\n 15. Even in the discharge of one’s most ordinary daily activities, one must do it very consciously and very carefully, and one must put one’s heart into it.\n 16. The real blessings of the spiritual master come when we become dependable, when he can trust.\n 17. Volunteer for higher service only after fulfilling the given responsibility.\n 18. For spiritual advancement, whatever little service you are given, you have to take that as your life and soul, and you have to be responsible.\n 19. The acceptance of your responsibility is the basis of bhakti.\n 20. Don’t be lazy about the given service.\n 21. What pleases a guru: when a disciple knows, no matter what happens, I will be there.\n 22. Follow the instructions of your guru-parampara, not the whims of your mind.\n 23. A true disciple aligns his mind, senses, family, and society to do the service assigned.\n 24. The behavior of a disciple can be an ornament for or a scar on the reputation of the spiritual master.\n 25. Service to the guru’s mission is not about ego or recognition; it is about being an instrument.\n 26. When there is disunity amongst devotees, there cannot be proper Sankirtan.\n 27. We have the responsibility to chant every day, the prescribed number of rounds.\n 28. We have the responsibility to follow the four regulative principles.\n 29. We need to be cooperative and put ourselves second, to create unity amongst the Vaishnavas.\n 30. The spiritual master may delegate service via his assistants; if you are dependable, you become dear to him, even if the master does not directly instruct you.\n 31. Don’t let a breath escape from your body without Krishna’s name. That should be our determination throughout our life.\n 32. The heart seems to have just a few wishes, as the surface of a sea seems to have just a few fishes, but if you see the deep inside, it gives a mesmerizing view.\n 33. Chant attentively; it’s not just the number but the quality of rounds.\n 34. Whether advanced or a beginner in Krishna Consciousness, we should not be neglectful even for a second. That one second could mean our spiritual life. It could even mean our material life.\n 35. Spirituality is based on development of character and philosophy.\n 36. Mercy means to get what we do not deserve.\n 37. Great souls are merciful. Srila Prabhupada was pleased with the little things that someone did, even if that person had all bad qualities.\n 38. All glories to Guru Maharaj means nothing left for us, no credit for us.\n 39. Krishna consciousness is not achieved but awarded.\n 40. Ultimately everything will perish except our relationship with Krishna. Whatever we invest in that relationship is eternal.\n 41. Bhakti means the science of being defeated. Krishna wants to be defeated by the love of His devotee, and the devotee wants to be defeated by Krishna’s love.\n 42. Bliss in Krishna Consciousness comes only when there is an eagerness to hear Krishna Katha.\n 43. Krishna is present fully in His Holy Name, and this is realized by humility and sincerity in our chanting.\n 44. Millions of people will come if you simply present Krishna as He is!\n 45. We are insignificant; our sins are also insignificant, which Krishna can easily vanquish.\n 46. A Vaishnava forgives the offender before the offense is over.\n 47. In giving respect, we can be very happy because we can do it in all situations.\n 48. When we expect respect, we are miserable because it is not that everyone in every situation will respect us.\n 49. If you compromise your integrity for the thrills of this world, you will suffer in the future.\n 50. Love is not enjoyment. Love is being enjoyed!\n 51. To love is to serve, and to serve is to please.\n 52. When you surrender, that’s where you get your strength from.\n 53. By allowing past karma to affect us, Krishna is giving us a chance to surrender more.\n 54. Surrender sounds horrible to one who wants to be a controller. But it is the sweetest and most pleasing of all words for a devotee who has a humble heart.\n 55. Without humility, you can have knowledge but not realization.\n 56. If you accept you are a fool, you can learn. If you don’t feel like a fool, then you are really a fool. :\n 57. At our level, genuine humility is to aspire for genuine humility.\n 58. If you have no determination, you are useless on the spiritual path.\n 59. To discriminate between the right and the wrong and to be determined to do the right is called determination.\n 60. Krishna consciousness becomes boring if you are not determined.\n 61. Gratitude doesn’t mean simply saying thank you. Real gratitude means reciprocation, even if it means great sacrifice.\n 62. If you read every word of Srila Prabhupada’s purports with a sense of urgency, believe me, these words will change your life.\n 63. Leadership is not a post to enjoy. Leadership is a very serious, significant responsibility of service to others.\n 64. Before we commit offenses to devotees, the stage comes in which we feel ourselves better than other devotees.\n 65. Offenses take away your service. The worst is that it takes away our propensity to serve.\n 66. Finding faults is sense gratification.\n 67. A person who finds faults in others is a person full of faults.\n 68. If a person is criticizing a Vaishnava, then that is the sign that Krishna has withdrawn His mercy, and that is the means by which Krishna withdraws His mercy.\n 69. The manifestation of ignorance is material desires. To be proud of our righteousness is also a sin.\n 70. When you advance in Krishna Consciousness, it is more difficult to tolerate being honored than to tolerate being dishonored.\n 71.

With all humility and surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Narsimhadev Bhagawan and Sri Sri Radha Gopinath ji, I sincerely pray for your good health and many more years of your physical association and guidance to all your disciple children. I humbly and sincerely pray that whatever I plan and wish to do gets strongly aligned to your instructions and Srila Prabhupada\u0027s satisfaction, ultimately making me an instrument in your hand for the pleasure of Sri Sri Gaura Nitai and their devotees.\n \n Please kindly keep showering your causeless mercy on all of us so that one day we all can eventually go back to the Godhead by following your divine instructions.}}\n \n Hare Krishna !!\n Your humble and unqualified servant,\n Shyam Kumar das"

The devotees gave me the opportunity to serve dinner prasadam to you. I was waiting in the hall while you were refreshing after your flight journey. When you came down the stairs, we both looked at each other. As you smiled at me, I moved towards you, and you hugged me.

Radhanath Swami Maharaj, let alone call him my Guru.\n During yatras, he cooks and serves prasad to devotees with utmost humility and seva bhav. When he does kirtan, the feeling of surrender and love for Krishna can be heard in his voice, filling the room with a divine energy. When he tells stories, he does it with such conviction that he transports you to the world where those divine leelas are happening. He smiles his wonderful smile when asked unexpected questions after lectures, and answers them perfectly, as if the question was never unexpected in the first place.\n When he came to Amritsar, he chose not to step on the petals spread for his lotus feet. He greeted everyone with folded hands. I have seen photos and videos of him embracing cows and calves with deep compassion, accepting flowers from little children, and blessing them with so much love and care. Maharaj does not just preach humility and compassion; he lives them. And he lives them so beautifully that, for a moment, you forget he is a global personality with thousands and lakhs waiting for even a minute of his association.\n After so many years in bhakti, with countless disciples and lectures, he still leads a life of simplicity, and that is inspirational. Sometimes, a little appreciation or success in seva can make one think, “I did it.” But Maharaj is not like that. He lives by the verse:\n Trinad api sunicena\n Taror api sahishnuna\n Amanina manadena\n Kirtaniyah sada Hari\n As a teen, he set out to find the true meaning and purpose of life. That journey challenged him physically, mentally, and emotionally. But he never gave up. His commitment inspires me, because he moved continents with faith, endured struggles with faith, and ultimately found what he was seeking because of that same faith. That faith is the guiding light of my life and the lives of many others. When he faced theft, uncertainty, and loneliness on his journey, he still found hope in the smallest signs. But today, we don’t have to move continents; we have Maharaj’s blessings and guidance.\n So when the road of life gets bumpy, when things feel too hard or complicated, may I also be able to say the words from one of the letters he wrote to his family: “Roads get bumpy at times, but they are fine roads.”\n I am not as great, wise, or learned as Maharaj; in fact, I am not even the dust on His feet, but I can try to walk the path he shows us, not just through his lectures, but through his way of life. To have faith like he did, and to be humble like he is, while doing whatever little seva I get to do—these are the goals of my life.\n HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj Ki Jai!"

Whatever little fortune we possess in spiritual life is only because of your causeless mercy and the mercy of Srila Prabhupada, who sent you as his empowered servant to spread the message of Krishna consciousness with such love, humility, and compassion.\n\nWe are utterly unworthy, yet you have accepted us as your own, overlooking our countless shortcomings. Just as the sun never discriminates while shining upon all, your mercy too flows unrestricted — reaching even the most fallen. The more we try to understand your magnanimity, the more humbled we become, realizing how small, insignificant, and dependent we truly are before your divine heart.\n\nThis year’s Kartik Yatra at Govardhan was especially memorable and spiritually uplifting. It reminded us so much of the Pune Yatras, where for hours together you would lead soul-stirring kirtans and share nectarean Krishna-katha that melted our hearts. Your presence transformed the holy dham into a living embodiment of love for Krishna.\n\nWe were deeply moved on Srila Prabhupada’s Disappearance Day, when you sang those heartfelt bhajans with tears in your eyes. Every note carried the weight of your devotion and gratitude to Srila Prabhupada. Witnessing you offer your heart and soul to our Param Guru, we were inspired to pray — “When will we develop even a fraction of such deep love, surrender, and gratitude toward our spiritual master?” Truly, Gurudev, you have shown us what it means to love in separation, to serve in gratitude, and to live in remembrance of one’s Guru and Krishna.\n\nDuring the Annakut celebration at Govardhan, our joy knew no bounds when we saw you personally appreciating every devotee and every dish lovingly prepared for Giriraj Govardhan Ji. Your affectionate glance uplifted everyone; your words of appreciation encouraged even the smallest efforts. We aspire, by your mercy, to one day develop that same genuine appreciation for devotees — seeing every devotee as a precious servant of Krishna, just as you always do.\n\nWe are also profoundly grateful to you, Gurudev, for gifting us the divine opportunity to serve in the Bhaktivedanta Hospital and to be part of such a wonderful congregation of devotees. You have shown us that true service is not merely a duty, but an offering of love to the Lord and His devotees. We pray for the strength, humility, and purity of heart to serve this mission with the same sincerity and dedication you embody.\n\nYou have also mercifully entrusted us with the responsibility of serving as counselors for the devotees of Mumbai and Konkan. This is indeed your special mercy upon us. Yet, we know that without imbibing the spirit of “dasa-dasanudas” — the servant of the servant of the servant — our service will remain incomplete. Therefore, we beg you, Gurudev, to bless us with the mood of genuine humility, to serve without pride, to guide without superiority, and to always remain your faithful instruments in spreading Srila Prabhupada’s mission.\n\nEach day, when we reflect upon our lives, we realize that every ounce of spiritual transformation, every spark of devotion, every moment of peace and purpose we experience — all originate from your mercy. You have not only shown us the path but also walked beside us, patiently guiding, correcting, and encouraging us at every step.\n\nGurudev, you are like a divine touchstone — whoever comes in contact with you becomes spiritually transformed. Your words illuminate the dark corners of our hearts; your example inspires us to strive for purity; your prayers shield us from maya’s allure. You are truly the compassionate heart of Srila Prabhupada’s mission — ever forgiving, ever inspiring, ever loving.\n\nWe offer our dandavat pranams again and again at your lotus feet, praying only for one thing — that we may remain forever in the shelter of your divine instructions, serving you and your devotees life after life, with sincerity, humility, and gratitude.\n\nMay our hearts always remember your smile, your kirtan, your words of wisdom, and your unwavering faith in Srila Prabhupada and Lord Krishna.\n\nWith deepest gratitude, love, and surrender, we remain —\n\nYour humble and aspiring servants,\n\nShyamkund Das\nBhadrapriya Devi Dasi\nJanakipriya\nBrajanand\nGopika\nand all our Counselees and Congregational Families"

They also play a major part in trying to make us understand the magnanimous nature of your personality.\n\nYet, on occasions like the yatras, we are only left spellbound and extremely touched at how deeply you want us to be Krishna Conscious for our own sake, and at who you actually are.\n\nWe are very, very small, Maharaj, at least I definitely am. It\u0027s an unbelievable world that you have given permission for me to gain entry into. Thank you for all the protection you always provide, many a time in the form of your disciples – senior, junior, and peers.\n\nWith lots of love for you, Maharaj, and with the best wishes for you in our hearts, we convey our heartfelt birthday wishes to you. Please do accept them.\n\nYour servant,\nShyamli Devi Dasi along with wishes from my son and my daughter"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept our humble obeisances.\nWish you a very happy 75th Vyāsa-pūjā.\nI am deeply indebted and grateful for the so many valuable teachings in your lectures as well as personal examples. These teachings can save many lives and humanity.\nI desire to make these teachings my life and soul.\nguru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koribo aikya, ār nā koriho mane āśā\nLast year in Māyāpur Yatra I heard from your lotus mouth and I observed it personally:\n\n1. Intense Japa in Devotee Association\nEvery morning you make it a point to chant with devotees intensely. How important it is to chant together in association with devotees feelingly early in the morning — putting chanting as the highest priority.\nIt’s mentioned that out of all the instructions of the spiritual master, chanting 16 rounds is the most important.\nYou received the mahā-mantra from Mother Gaṅgā and later from His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Śrīla Prabhupāda.\nIt’s really impressive and inspiring to see that you take up doing intense japa so seriously.\nWherever you are in the world, you try to chant with devotees and also try to chant the whole day whenever there is free time after 16 rounds are complete.\nThis is a great inspiration for me.\nThose six days of chanting with you in Śrī Māyāpur Dhām are my greatest treasure that I shall cherish my whole life.\n\n2. Hearing from Śrīla Prabhupāda Daily\nYou hear from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s recorded lectures every day.\nOut of the 64 items of devotional service described in Śrī Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, the first three are related to the spiritual master: śrī-guru-pādāśraya, dīkṣā, and sevā.\nYou have taken this so seriously and that’s so inspiring to see.\nI also wish to make it a goal that I hear from you every day and thereby nourish the most important connection.\n\n3. Sensitivity Toward Vaishnavas\nLast time in Śrī Māyāpur Dhām Yatra, I was deeply touched to see your sensitivity.\nOn Nov 5th, during Śrīla Prabhupāda’s disappearance observance, when the time was ticking, you let HG Mandākinī Mātaji go on with her offering and also let HG Mālati Mātaji speak next — who promptly pointed to the time for “Je Anilo Premadhana” prayer, which was your turn to sing.\nSometimes we are so obsessed with time that we don’t mind doing offenses, but I was very touched and impressed to see your Vaiṣṇava ideal behavior — putting the feelings and satisfaction of Vaiṣṇavas above time.\n\n4. Magnanimous Acceptance of All Devotees\nLast Māyāpur Yatra, around 12,000 devotees came.\nYou had every option and justification to reject or cut off after a certain number, but you accepted all with an open, compassionate, magnanimous heart.\nIn fact, it’s the new mission statement of the Yatra committee:\n“The more the devotees, the more there are opportunities to serve.”\nWhat a broad and magnanimous way to encourage everyone.\n\n5. Humility in Personal Comfort\nLast Vyāsa-pūjā meeting, HG Vaiśeṣika Mahārāja shared that one time when all of you had to go somewhere, you took the back folded difficult seat of the car and gave everyone the comfortable seat.\nThat was so inspiring — to see how to put oneself last and everyone else first.\n\nThere are many, many more things that inspire all of us from your teachings and personal example, but for this year I want to keep the above five as my goal and inspiration to follow.\nI wish to please you by following these principles in my life.\nDear Guru Maharaj, I honestly admit that I have been falling short, but today I recommit to follow your instructions and be a true disciple by disciplining myself to follow your instructions.\nI beg forgiveness for my shortcomings and beg for your mercy and empowerment.\nI pray to Their Lordships to give you good health so that you can deliver more and more souls.\nThank you very much.\nEternally indebted to you.\nYour Aspiring Servant,\nShyamrupa Das"

This itself indicates what is my devotional status.\n \n You have been very merciful to have given permission to stay in Sri Sri Radhagopinath Brahmachari ashram for some years, although when I look back, it\u0027s like a miracle as to how I landed up there.\n \n I was just hearing about the qualities of devotees from NOD and sure enough, I don\u0027t fit into any.\n \n You have given me brahmana initiation also, and although I thought I would become more serious, I feel that I am gliding down. Somehow, miraculously, due to some reason, although I can\u0027t follow the regulative principles and sadhana properly, I am still in devotee association and am engaged in preaching service and deity worship.\n \n You are the perfect embodiment of all the Vaishnava qualities you preach. Your every word and deed is so profound and deep. I have not seen a person so compassionate, so caring, extending and loving to whoever comes in contact with you, nay, of their material or spiritual disposition. You are the perfect example of an Uttamadhikari maha bhagavata. Yet, you are so reachable to everyone. I know that you fear that you think you may not be able to serve everyone who connects with you, but I can say, like Krishna\u0027s mere glance inspires, so does yours.\n \n You have ended your Karthik Yatra 2025 final day lecture with the words, \"And be very kind to each other.\"\n This in itself sums up your whole personality. I am personally very fortunate to have had your association. The first time I approached you for an autograph, waiting outside your residence in Mayapur, I got the answer, \"Another time, please.\"\n But you have given your association and a place in the ashram, and what did I do? I have been a disturbance. I couldn\u0027t even be punctual in giving you a seat for chanting, nor to offer Damodar Arati lamp for offering, and not to mention the goof-ups I did in guest service. Yet, you tolerated.\n \n But I am so shameless that I don\u0027t have that quality even in a fraction.\n \n I beg at your holy feet that I at least cease to be a bad example, if not a worthy one.\n Let those words, \"Be very kind to each other,\" and \"How can I serve you?\" become the guiding light. You also were mentioning in one lecture to make the chanting of 16 rounds and hearing the topmost priority of our lives and see the magic it does in our lives. I want to desperately experience that magic.\n \n I don\u0027t have the mood, the attitude, nor the qualification to get your mercy, yet I hope and eagerly and earnestly pray that somehow this one may render something tangible in perfecting his life and helping those connected.\n \n Let me be freed of the anarthas and get properly engaged in seva. Let all the situations, the troubles, the happy moments, sorrow, everything just bring me closer to your lotus feet.\n \n Let me become a good husband according to your wish, a good son, good brother, and if possible, a good father, and most important of all, a good disciple and a good Vaishnava sevak.\n \n Thank you very much for your kindness.\n \n May you live long, long for many years to come. Let my whole life span come to you. May you remain healthy so that you can deliver so many like this one...\n \n Your example and kindness has transformed my roller-coaster married life into a hopeful grihastha life.\n \n I am very happy and delighted to share that I found shelter in my senior Godbrothers like HG Braja Chandra Pr, HG Balaram Shakti Pr, HG Shubha Vilas Pr, HG Gauranga Pr, HG Shyamananda Pr, HG Premanidhi Pr, HG Jadu Thakur Pr, HG Gauranga Vihari Pr, HG Nimai Chand Pr, and so on, who brought me into Bhakti, nurtured, tolerated, inspired, and continue to inspire me.\n I am also very grateful for my brahmachari and grihastha friends, all the wonderful Vaishnavas you gave me. I cannot possibly mention each one\u0027s name. They are all keeping me alive and growing in Bhakti.\n \n Thank you very, very much for everything.\n \n May I become a worthy disciple, and when I come before you, let my guilt be a little less and happiness more, that I served you better than before.\n \n Your unworthy servant\n Shyamsundar Ananda das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna dear Maharaj,\n It\u0027s hard for me to believe that this year is going to be your 75th Vyas Puja. Time flies by so quickly. With each passing year, the amount of time that we have to be living in the same contemporary time as you keeps on reducing. I get shivers whenever I think about this. It makes me want to utilize every opportunity to be able to get your darshan and hear from your lotus mouth.\n Maharaj, I feel that I owe my entire spiritual life to you. I had always been antagonistic toward organized religion and especially ISKCON. Due to my severe conditioning, the culture of Krishna consciousness as I had seen it from afar seemed very alien to me. It was only a chance reading of your book \"The Journey Home\" that I got the inspiration to try out Krishna consciousness. Back in 2013 when I read your book, I remember thinking to myself that if this seeker of truth spent so much time and effort in traveling all over India and trying out all the major spiritual paths and if he settled down upon Krishna consciousness and ISKCON, then there must definitely be something about this path. I still remember the struggle of my initial few years in Krishna consciousness when I would read and re-read Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books trying to feel attracted to the philosophy but wasn\u0027t able to because of my previous attachments to impersonalistic philosophy. All during that while I felt like quitting so many times, but each time I would always remember you thinking that if you have been following this path for so many years, then this path is certainly the highest. I took my own sweet time to be completely convinced of the path, and it took many years for my faith to get steady. During this time, your lectures used to give me a lot of solace. Also, I got excellent mentorship and guidance from your disciples.\n It\u0027s been twelve years since I started practicing Krishna consciousness, and I can see a vast difference in myself then and now. Every time I think about what direction my life would have gone in if I hadn\u0027t come across your book, I shudder. I have never had a personal interaction with you. But if I ever have one, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything that you have done.\n Your insignificant aspiring servant,\n Siddharth"

By the boundless mercy of the Lord, I am receiving guidance under the care of a wonderful and deeply realized devotee — HG Dinanath Gopal Prabhuji, your beloved disciple.\n.\nThough Prabhuji never instructed or suggested that I choose you as my Guru, his humility, tolerance, and dedication reflected your divine qualities so profoundly that my heart naturally found its way to you. By observing his behavior and his deep affection for you, I could feel your presence and mercy flowing through him.\n.\nMaharaj, your teachings have become the guiding light of my spiritual journey. Every word you speak carries the fragrance of Srila Prabhupada\u0027s compassion. Through your lectures and pastimes, I have realized that bhakti is not attained by knowledge or renunciation alone but by sincerely offering one\u0027s heart in loving service.\n.\nWhen I hear your pastimes — how you left the comfort of worldly life, wandered across lands in search of truth, and finally surrendered at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada in 1971 — my heart trembles with awe. You are a living example of the verse:\n\n“sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje\nahaituky apratihatā yayātmā suprasīdati”\nSB : 1.2.6\n“The supreme occupation for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotion must be causeless and uninterrupted to completely satisfy the self.”\n.\nMaharaj, your life is the embodiment of this pure devotion.\n.\nYour lecture on \"The Power of Forgiveness\" 2015 taught me that true strength lies not in defeating others, but in conquering one\u0027s own ego.\nIn \"Compassion — The Essence of Spiritual Life\" GEV, 2018, you revealed that real bhakti is to see every living being as a child of Krishna.\nAnd in your book \"The Journey Home — The Journey Within” 2019, I understood that Krishna consciousness is not an escape from the world but the deepest connection to its divine essence.\n.\nDuring this recent Kartik Yatra in Govardhan, I received your darshan for the first time. I cannot express the feeling that arose within me. As I saw your effulgent form, my heart overflowed with tears of gratitude. It felt as if time stood still, and Srila Prabhupada whispered in my heart, \"This is your shelter.\" Your effulgence didn’t just light up the atmosphere — it illuminated my inner darkness.\n.\nSince that sacred moment, I have been trying to walk the path of devotion under the gentle guidance of my Shiksha Guru, HG Dinanath Gopal Prabhuji. His nurturing care and spiritual upbringing constantly nourish my faith and help me remain steady in ISKCON’s service. By Srila Prabhupada\u0027s grace, I completed my IDC in 2024, and I am learning to serve sincerely in small ways.\n.\nMaharaj, I have no qualifications, — only prayers. Still, I beg at your lotus feet that one day, if Krishna so desires and if you deem me worthy, I may receive your shelter and serve Srila Prabhupada\u0027s mission with a pure heart. To be accepted as your disciple would be the greatest fortune of countless lifetimes.\n\n\"tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam\nśābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam”\nSB : 11.3.21\n“Therefore, one who desires real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him with great faith and devotion.”\n.\nMaharaj, your contribution to society — through Govardhan Eco Village, your heartfelt lectures, your compassion toward devotees and non-devotees alike — continues to transform countless lives. You have taught me that the true wealth of life is to love and to serve.\n.\nThough physically distant, I always feel your presence in the gentle whisper of kirtan and in every moment of sincere service. When I remember your smile and your words, my heart feels both the sweetness of connection and the pain of longing— a reminder of how unqualified yet hopeful this insignificant servant truly is.\n.\nI offer my deepest gratitude to Srila Prabhupada and to you, Maharaj, for giving us the priceless gift of Krishna consciousness. I pray to remain forever a small speck of dust at your lotus feet — serving Srila Prabhupada\u0027s mission, trying to associate with the devotees, and dedicating my every breath to spreading the message of bhakti just as all ACBSP disciples have done for him.\n.\nYour divine effulgence, your humility, and your compassion have kindled a flame of devotion within me that I pray may never extinguish.\n.\nPraying to sri sri radha madhav for your good health and long live.\n.\nYour insignificant aspiring servant,\nSiddharth Dubey\nISKCON Kanpur\nWishing you a very, very happy 75th appearance day, Maharaj. 🙇‍♂️"

What do they get from this?”\n But this process, as given by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is so potent that if followed properly under the guidance of a spiritual master,\n It will slowly help remove all the anarthas from our heart and lead us to the highest perfection — Kṛṣṇa-prema.\n Maharaja, I pray that I try to follow your instructions and serve in the mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda in the mood of a servant of a servant of a servant.\n \n Your servant,\n Siddheshwar Anand Dās"

All glories to your divine spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada. All glories to Your Holiness!\n\nIt is certainly befitting to glorify you on this day, as Lord Krishna is most pleased when we glorify His devotees. Glorification of Your Holiness is glorification of the Lord. The Lord is more pleased when the devotees are glorified. In the scriptures, so much time is spent in glorifying the devotees. Lord Krishna does not seek glorification. As a small, insignificant disciple, all that I can offer you is my life. Still, my sincere hope is that my offering of my life will be satisfying to you.\n\nIn Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a verse—10.22.35—that it is the duty of every living being to perform welfare activities for the benefit of others with his life, wealth, intelligence, and words.\n\nYou set such a wonderful example in this regard. Everything you do, every breath you take, is for the benefit of others. You are truly magnanimous. Your mercy is like a great monsoon rain cloud extinguishing the fire of conditional life—of repeated birth and death. You are promoting the true path of Dharma worldwide—the message of Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nYour chanting of Hare Krishna kirtan inspires devotees all over the world to take shelter of the Holy Names—Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. Your example of simplicity and renunciation makes an impression deep in the hearts of those who have the good fortune to meet you. Indeed, it has been my own good fortune of association with you that I have been able to come into Krishna consciousness. This year, in July, you initiated me in Washington D.C. and offered me the beautiful name Sita Vallabhi devi dasi. I have no clue how to describe it, but I am blissful from within. You have initiated thousands of disciples all over the world, and I consider myself most fortunate to be one of them.\n\nMany of your disciples are great preachers, scholars, pandits, and serve you in myriad amazing ways, which are reflections of the facets of the unlimited jewel-like qualities that you possess. Your wonderful attraction and steadfast devotion to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada is your topmost quality. That is the quality that I seek to inherit from you. With this quality, you transcend everything and are constantly fixed in the ultimate reality of Krishna consciousness.\n\nOn this most holy day of your 75th vyasa puja, in seeking to offer Your Holiness first-class worship, I pray for the benediction that I can always remember the transcendental instructions emanating from your lotus mouth. I pray to always worship those instructions on the altar of my heart and always endeavor to carry out those instructions.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nSita Vallabhi devi dasi"

My humble prostrated obeisances at the lotus feet of the most worshipable Radhanath Swami Maharaj.👏\nMy first opportunity to meet Maharaj happened because of my brother, Rohini Tanay Das, who was a brahmachari at Govind Dham, Nigdi. Due to cancer, he left for the Bhagavat Dham on 2/3/2011. A person absorbed in Krishna consciousness does not consider death to be important; he feels joy, knowing he is going back to his real mother and father. I learned from him how to say this and how to face intense pain with a smile.\nOn the 14th, during the Pran Pratishtha of Sri Sri Radha Radhagovindaji, we were standing in the temple when Phulsangi Mataji met us. She asked, ‘Did you meet Maharaj?’ We said, ‘No… how can we meet him?’ She then held my hand and, cutting through the crowd, took us to where Maharaj was, because he was about to leave. ‘Come, I will take you to meet him,’ she said.\nAll of us followed her to the place where Maharaj was standing. When she told Maharaj, ‘These are Rohini Tanay’s parents, sister and brother,’ Maharaj embraced my father tightly. That moment was unforgettable. Even before that, through Rohini Tai, I had already accepted Maharaj as my Guru and had heard so much about Maharaj from Rohini Tanay. After seeing him personally, I was overwhelmed — on one side, the grief of my brother, and on the other side, the satisfaction of receiving the direct darshan of my Guru Maharaj. No one spoke anything; everyone was speaking through their eyes.\nFrom that day on, I decided that Maharaj would be my Guru. Later, while standing in the prasadam line, someone placed a photo of Maharaj in my mother’s hand. She gave the photo to me saying, ‘What will I do with this photo? You chant on beads, you keep it.’ At that moment, I understood that everything was Krishna’s arrangement. I took the photo, and since then I have been sharing every happiness and sorrow with Maharaj. In many unseen ways, he has guided me, and the result of that is that I am trying to follow the verse from Maharaj’s many lectures — the verse from Chaitanya Shikshashtakam: “Trinad api sunichena, taror iva sahishnuna…” Although I am not qualified, I am offering my efforts to such a divine Guru like Maharaj.\nMany difficulties came, but Maharaj helped me remain steady and patient in bhakti. May Maharaj be blessed with a long and healthy life, and may he, full of compassion and mercy, always remain joyful for the sake of all devotees.\nIf anything wrong or inappropriate has been spoken out of enthusiasm, kindly forgive this servant.👏\""

Since many years, Gurudev, you had a desire to have Kartik Yatra to Govardhan, but due to lack of accommodation, it did not happen. The best yatra ever had, and this year it came true by your blessings. Not even a drop of rain we faced for 7 days, though it was raining in Vrindavan and Mathura. Govardhan was above our heads, truly as it was during Lord Krsna\u0027s holding Govardhan. Seven days, seven nights, the Govardhan lila happened; it was the same for us, just because of you, beloved Gurudev. Fortunately, I had an opportunity to come for the yatra. Please bless me; till my last breath, may I get a chance to attend all your Kartik Yatras, your association may I get, I may learn to serve, and always be part of the solution. Also, Gurudev, I could have such a great spiritual opportunity, full of blessings and mercy, to be in dham for Kartik Yatra 2025. A word, \"thank you,\" is very small in front of your infinite blessings and mercy. We really love you.\n\n• Thanking you from the bottom of my heart…!!!\n\nWith a very happy heart, I would like to thank you infinitely for the Kartik Yatra 2025 at Govardhan. Luckily, my room was near Govardhan. Every morning, while coming towards the pandal, the first darshan would be of Govardhanji. Then, after offering a lamp to him, I would head towards the pandal. It would be so inspiring. After Mangal Aarti, Tulsi Aarti, and Japa session, I could get your holy association japa, and then we would go for the temple darshan in the morning. Short class, then evening your lectures would be so enlivening that I would feel it should never stop. Huge number of devotee association, blessings of great senior disciples of Srila Prabhupada, also yours was full mercy of Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. Many times, I have seen and observed, you love everyone truly, especially I have seen that you have so much love, respect, and care for your god brothers and sisters. Please bless us; may we have the same between our god brothers and sisters. Every yatra is full of learnings. Please bless, Gurudev; may it keep coming like the mercy may continuously flow on us.\n\n• Your mercy truly guarded us…!!!\n\nIt was raining in Mathura and Vrindavan. Full 7 days, but Krishna truly held the umbrella for all of us for all 7 days of the Yatra!!! Like He held it during Govardhan lila Govardhan Giridhari, Krsna holds Govardhan for 7 days and nights to protect his devotees from Samvartaka clouds—pralaya clouds sent by Indra. Indra couldn\u0027t identify his boss, Supreme Krsna. Such is the power, potency of the beloved Lord, Yog Maya of Supreme Krsna. By your grace, we didn\u0027t even get rain while returning back home to material life.\n\n• Causeless mercy in the form of a golden chance.!!!\n\nI am very happy to know that this year, by your causeless mercy, all got a chance to write offerings for you on this special day of your “Vyasa Puja” and it was announced that the temple RGM community will be compiling *Vyas Puja Book* as an offering for you, dear Gurudev, on *75th appearance day* of yours, where in devotees can send their Vyasa Puja Offerings to you through this Google form, https://forms.gle/BSdYwzEHx66nxTdf6.\nI am not qualified to write, but I want to wish you and thank you for everything on your special day, so I grabbed this opportunity.\n\n• Wish to share what inspired me the most from your spotless class…!!!\n\nGurudev, recently I heard one of your old lectures where you mentioned about how a king\u0027s haunted daughter\u0027s body, a ghost left the movement. Ramanuja Acharya kept his feet on the girl\u0027s head; immediately the ghost left her body, never to return. I was very inspired to hear how when pure devotees even touch, it can make wonders. Your recorded lectures are often discussed. I draw inspiration from them, and a compilation of your own, full of nectar lectures, which is available in the tape named Kathamrita Sindhu, which is a collection of your teachings. Really, this tape made my life. Being in a situation, it got the better, best way, which taught how to always remember Krsna, never forget Krsna. Thanking you and Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, I could get a chance this birth to hear such a systematic creation, that is this tape. Really thankful for this Kathamrita Sindhu. Please keep compiling the same in the future; may we get a chance to hear all your past, present, future lectures, at least at one place after Sri Sri Radha Gopinath temple. That\u0027s this kind of tape, Rg Media—Kathamrita Sindhu Nectarean Ocean of Hari Katha Vol 1, Theme-wise Collection of Audio Classes, which has 1300+ audio, 3000+ hours. Everyone may get a chance to hear. All your lectures, kirtans, bhajans, especially kalikukkura, holy name chanting, the best, infinity stars for it. Few years ago, I really had a strong desire to have something like Srila Prabhupada tape; your lectures to be in it. Finally, it\u0027s here. Similarly, Gurudev, whatever I had in life, have in life, will have in life is your mercy, your credit for which I wish to thank you infinitely. Please keep your mercy always. Lots of love, respects, obesiances to you, dearest Gurudev.\n\n• Your mercy truly keep it continuously. Please bless, Gurudev…!!!\n\nPlease bless me as this inborn talent, like I can sing bhajans, kirtans. In our counseling meetings, devotees\u0027 homes, or earlier in our kirtan melas, different big institutes, sometimes I get to do leading kirtan seva. Everyone praises me. At that time also, till the date, it\u0027s your blessings and Sri Sri Radha Gopinath\u0027s mercy completely that I was given a chance to serve. Doing nothing, I got all praises. You know, Gurudev, once I was at a very famous institute, in the presence of the owner and everyone connected to them, where many dignitaries were also present. We had to show our unique talents. So, at that time, I sang the bhajan \"Ohe Vaishnav Thakkura Dayara Sagara.\" Before it, I just prayed at your feet, and before I began, I shared a few spiritual thoughts to make them a little comfortable with what I was going to do, along with the name of Srila Prabhupada and the band The Beatles. Everyone there was dancing in the kirtan. They were shouting, \"Once more, once more!\" They felt it was unique, never heard such slow, then fast dancing beats, kind of a song which I played with kartal and a plastic chapli cymbal. They praised me like anything. A small token of a gift I gave them, Sri Sri Radha Gopinath\u0027s photos and prasad. At that time, I was missing you because all I got was your blessings. Other talents, intellect, and much more, everything. I may not be proud and always remain humble. All this should help me grow in Bhakti and preaching mission. This may add betterment for preaching the mission. Please bless, may I use my everything in the service of the Lordships, devotees, your service, Gurudev, also get the devotee qualities which will help me more in Bhakti, go closer to devotees, Krsna, then finally the place which is full of bliss, full of eternity. Please bless; let me be able to do something for the mission of Srila Prabhupada and the society. Begging your blessings.\n\n* A small sweet poem for you, dear Guru Maharaj *\n\n**At your lotus feet I bow, O master kind and true,**\n**Through every word and gentle smile, Kṛṣṇa’s mercy flows from you.**\n**You teach us how to chant with love, to serve with heart and grace,**\n**And by your boundless compassion, we glimpse the Lord’s sweet face.**\n**O guide of my wandering soul, please keep me near your side—**\n**In your shelter lies my fortune, in your footsteps, all my pride.**}}\n\nLots of love, obesiances at your feet. May your mission complete and flourish forever.\nHarekrsna dandwat pranam, dearest Guru Maharaj.\nGurudev, yours and only yours.\nPlease forgive me if I spoke much or beyond my limits.\nKeep your blessings on me, my family, forever grateful to you.\nYour servant, your daughter, your unworthy disciple,\nSneha Gopi Devi Dasi."

But this lifetime, for sure, I’ve got a meaning to my life, for I have the great fortune of understanding the Love and Mercy of our Supreme *suhṛdaṁ*, Krishna, through you.\n \n Your first glance ever at me in Kartik Mayapur yatra 2024 is the most unforgettable moment of my life. You looked directly into my eyes and gestured as if saying to me, “Your time has come, my dear child,” giving me assurance that you are there for me and will take me back home to Krishna.\n \n Guru Maharaj, from the bottom of my heart, I just long to serve you sincerely, to bring meaning to every instruction of yours in my life. I no more long for the day when the final destination will be reached, for the journey under your guidance is itself so meaningful. Your instructions of genuine humility, compassion, servitude, and prayerful mood, heard in your lectures and personified by you, have added the real essence to my consciousness, making it at least worthy of being offered to Krishna.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, please overlook the countless flaws in this fallen soul and accept me in the service of your lotus feet, the way you wish to.\n \n My sincere prayerful desire presented at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Madhav through a sincere devotee……\n \n “Still your mercy flows, O RadhaGopinath,\n In the form of my Master, Swami Radhanath.\n For he is the soul so divine and pure,\n A beautiful flower of your garland for sure.\n \n He is the hope for this hopeless soul;\n To follow his footprints is the purpose sole.\n Please do fulfill this desire, O’ Master of my Master,\n To surrender to him submissively, as his sincere disciple."

All glories to you!\n Thank you so much for mercifully accepting this fallen conditioned soul as your disciple. We feel truly blessed to be receiving Harinama Diksha this year, 2025, at the Bhakti Center in New York.\n Maharaj, it has been almost a decade-long journey since I first connected with the devotees on July 4th, 2015. I was fortunate to meet you for the first time in Seattle in 2016. From that day onwards, you have given me countless instructions through your vani—your words, your books, and your lectures. You have guided me at every step, answering so many of my questions and uplifting my consciousness whenever I felt lost.\n This year during Sadhu Sanga, I was following you, and at one moment you were signing your books for devotees. Someone announced that it would be the last book you would sign. At that moment you mercifully glanced at me, and I still remember that entire scene vividly. Maharaj, if I made any mistake at that time, I sincerely beg your forgiveness.\n By the mercy of the Richmond community of devotees, I have been given the opportunity to share whatever little knowledge I have with others. I am doing this under the guidance of senior devotees. Maharaj, please give me the strength to deeply read, understand, and repeat Srila Prabhupada’s teachings without duplicity—just like a simple, sincere parrot.\n You always instruct your devotees to have a single-pointed focus on Krishna—to ask, “How can I please Krishna?” and to cultivate humility and gratitude. I feel disappointed that I am not able to practice these qualities consistently. Please forgive me, Maharaj, and kindly shower your mercy upon me.\n On this most auspicious day of your Vyasa-puja, I beg at your lotus feet:\n Please guide me, strengthen me, and help me read and understand Srila Prabhupada’s books, and deepen my bhakti and devotional knowledge.\n Once again, thank you, Srila Gurudev, for giving me this precious opportunity to express my heartfelt feelings on your sacred appearance day.\n Your servant,\n Sreenivas Mukunda Das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n \n Wish you a very happy 75th Vyasa Puja. From the very beginning of your childhood, you were very compassionate towards everyone. You had concern especially for the ones who were poor and down trodden. You were embarrassed of having better things for yourself. Your whole life is the life of simplicity and the life filled with compassion for everyone. You dedicated the primetime of your youth to your Spiritual Master, Srila Prabhupada, in service of Krishna. You exemplify your instruction of “In giving we receive”. You have given your life to Srila Prabhupada in spreading the mission of Lord Chaitanya. By doing so, you have received the mercy of Lord Chaitanya and empowerment to spread Lord Chaitanya\u0027s mission all over the world. For more than 50 years, you have been a beacon of hope for hopeless souls. Thank you, Gurumahraj, for descending on this earth to deliver the fallen souls like me and drag us out from the darkest well of this material world. There were many challenges, especially after the departure of Srila Prabhupada from this material world. But you never compromised in your mission to serve Srila Prabhupada. You have always been loyal and faithful to Srila Prabhupada and his mission. You always stress this point: that we should always be loyal and faithful to Srila Prabhupada. You teach by your example.\n \n In SB 11.9.29, it is said: *labdhvā su-durlabham idaṁ bahu-sambhavānte mānuṣyam artha-dam anityam apīha dhīraḥ*. After many, many births, one achieves this very, very rare human form, and this human form gives the opportunity to perfect one\u0027s life by practicing devotional service. Without devotional service, there is no meaning to human life, and there is no difference between a human being and an animal. The same sense gratification is there for all the species of life. I am very grateful to you for giving the life of devotional service. I don’t deserve it, but you showed your merciful glance on me and accepted me under your shelter. I am eternally indebted to you. At times, I wonder what I did to deserve such causeless mercy.\n \n One of the most important instructions that you emphasize is to be very attentive in chanting and to make this a priority. You emphasize that one should cultivate menial service and a humble attitude. This humble attitude makes our chanting and service pleasing to Krishna. You say humility is not a detail of devotional service; it is the core and a very integral part of devotional service. We see that in many of your lectures, you always quote the “Trinad api sunichena” verse. You are the personification of humility. We see that even at this age, you make a point to come to Japa early in the morning and inspire all the devotees around you. Most of the time, I fall short in doing attentive chanting. With immense faith in your instruction, Guru Maharaj, and with your mercy, I promise to make chanting my priority. You also emphasize cultivating eagerness to do devotional service enthusiastically and read Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books. Once, after the program in Stanford, I was driving you to HG Vaisesika Prabhu\u0027s home. I asked if there was any instruction for me. You said, “Always practice Sadachar; always have an ethical and good conduct, and specifically in how one is interacting with other people.” I surrender to you and beg for mercy so that I can follow these instructions diligently.\n \n Guru Maharaj, I beg forgiveness for our countless offenses. I beg for your blessings so that we can serve in Srila Prabhupada’s Sankirtan movement and please HG Vaisesika Prabhu and HG Nirakula Mataji. Please let me always remain safe in the shelter of your lotus feet. Wishing you all good health for many years to come so that you inspire many souls to take to Krishna Consciousness.\n \n Your Servant,\n Sri Gopal Das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj, please accept my humble obeisances in the dust of Your lotus feet! All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n\nWhile practicing devotional service, from time to time I’m looking back \u0026 recalling my first meeting with You, Guru Maharaj. When I was listening to Your first lecture in Russia, while You were talking about service to the Vaishnavas, I was feeling – that’s it! That’s what I was looking for all my life. \u0026 somebody from inside told me quite strongly – this is your Guru! Although I was initiated already by another person. I’m sure it was Krishna, who else can do it?! \u0026 during listening to so many of Your classes I had the same feeling – Who else but Krishna can say something so exact, sharp \u0026 so close to my heart! It is what I was feeling all my life but couldn’t express myself. Like recently I’ve read one of Your constant sayings: «All virtues have their origin in gratitude». I started to contemplate: Because gratitude means to recognize what was done for me by somebody else \u0026 finally by Krishna as origin of everything, that means that as soon I understood it I’m in connection with Krishna, Who is the source of all good qualities. As soon as one has connection with Krishna, he has all the good qualities. For You it’s not just a theory, Guru Maharaj, I know it for sure. \u0026 while contemplating further on this I could understand that this is practically only experience for me of Krishna’s presence in my life \u0026 the way to connect with Him. Like recently my mother left her body. All the time, from my first days in ISKCON, she was telling me: «Son, when you leave this?» Of course, she had no inclination to spiritual life at all. On the contrary, she was addicted to all the sins possible! \u0026 I could clearly understand – I can do nothing about it, except feeding her prasadam! But due to Krishna’s \u0026 Your mercy, her last word was «Krishna»! She died as a Vaishnavi. \u0026 not only this, but she was cremated \u0026 this is itself quite difficult to do, considering our family traditions \u0026 her ashes were put into Yamuna! The more I live, the more I have the feeling – Krishna, Srila Prabhupada \u0026 You, Guru Maharaj are my best friend. Not in plural, because You are one in some sense Guru is sakshad Hari. You all are always with me! I’m feeling that You are one team \u0026 while I’m thinking of one of You, then immediately I’m remembering all of You. So, again \u0026 again I’m feeling – You are Krishna’s mercy on me, Guru Maharaj. Unfortunately, this feeling is not lasting long \u0026 my life again \u0026 again becomes ordinary. I understand, yes, it’s because I have no real taste to serve Your lotus feet – rati, which is not coming soon, because it’s Uttama gati – highest perfection of a disciple’s life. But by Your mercy I know the way! I should just strictly follow Your divine instructions \u0026 moreover, to strive to help You in fulfilling Srila Prabhupada’s mission. Then I’ll be tuned to Krishna’s wave \u0026 feel Him \u0026 You constantly. I still can’t believe that my empty \u0026 stupid life came to an end \u0026 I can devote all my life to the service to Srila Prabhupada’s \u0026 Your lotus feet! So, on this most auspicious day I’m praying to You to help me, in spite of all my impurities \u0026 hard egotism, to keep strongly in my heart Your Divine Lotus Feet, which means Your Divine instructions \u0026 strictly follow this great mercy of the Lord. I’m sure this is the only way to Krishna.\n\nAspiring to become Your real disciple,\nSri Gourahari Das."

This blessed time of the year gathers all your devoted children in one family of love, united by your compassion. And as we join them, our hearts tremble with wonder:\n \n How did we, who possess no purity, no insight, no devotion, become recipients of your boundless mercy?\n \n In this vast and turbulent universe, how did your soothing glance fall upon our small and struggling lives? How did we gain the fortune of your darshan, the sweetness of your voice, and the shelter of your lotus feet? These gifts are treasures far beyond our worth, yet you offer them freely—like a monsoon cloud pouring rain upon even barren land.\n \n It was never our qualification;\n it was always your causeless grace.\n We did not discover you;\n you discovered us.\n You searched for us, lifted us, and gently placed us on the path of devotion.\n \n Guru Maharaj, though your mercy flows ceaselessly, we remain like stones—unmoved, unsoftened—closing the doors of our own hearts out of fear that surrender will take away our petty attachments. We cling to illusion as if it were some priceless jewel, while neglecting the vast ocean of love you are offering. What misfortune could be greater than this?\n \n Just as Krishna speaks of klaibya and hṛdaya-daurbalyam, we too suffer from weakness of heart—hesitation, indecision, and a deep-rooted reluctance to let go of worldly desires. And yet, you, our most compassionate spiritual master, are the expert physician who has cured countless souls with the medicine of Krishna’s holy name and Vaishnava seva.\n \n On this sacred Vyāsa–pūjā day, we fall at your feet and beg:\n \n Please give us the strength\n to open our hearts to your grace.\n Please give us the courage\n to choose devotion over delusion.\n Please give us the sincerity\n to accept your healing touch.\n Please give us the fortune\n to become instruments of your compassion.\n \n We do not pray for transcendence for our own pleasure;\n we pray only that our family may become useful tools—\n however small, however unqualified—\n in your divine mission of love.\n \n Dearest Guru Maharaj,\n thank you for everything—\n for seeing in us what we could not see,\n for believing in us when we could not believe,\n for endlessly loving us when we did nothing to deserve it.\n \n On this day, and on every day,\n we offer our lives at your lotus feet.\n Your insignificant servants,\n Sri Kishore Das, Vrajamohini Devi Dasi, and family"

Yet, your mercy is so kind that even people like us, unqualified and forgetful, are given a place under your shelter.\n\n==================================================\nFrom Sherwood Forest to Śrī Vṛndāvana:\n\nIn quiet Sherwood\u0027s leafy shade,\nA boy once walked, alone he prayed,\nWhere Highland Park met sky and stream,\nHe whispered life’s unanswered dreams.\n\nYoung Gerald’s son, with searching eyes,\nWhile others played, he gazed the skies.\nIdelle, his gentle mother’s care,\nAnd Grandpa Bill with stories rare.\n\nAn older brother, Marty, near,\nBut still he felt, “I don’t belong here.”\nThough nurtured in a loving home,\nHis soul had wings — it longed to roam.\n\nOn his thirteenth year, a gift was laid,\nPeter, Paul, and Mary played —\n“Early in the morning, at break of day,\nI ask the Lord to help me find my way.”\n\nFolk songs, blues, and deep refrains,\nB.B. King and Dylan’s strains.\n\"Within You, Without You,\" he would sigh,\nGeorge’s sitar opened the sky.\n\nHe heard the cry of Old Man River,\nFelt the blues in his young heart shiver.\nFrom Johnny Rivers\u0027 soulful plea,\n“Look to your soul”—thus turned the key.\n\nAt fourteen years, he walked the halls\nOf Deerfield High with hidden calls.\nBut classrooms could not hold his mind —\nThe world was vast; truth undefined.\n\nTo Florida’s warmth his journey led,\nBut not for leisure, fame, or bread.\nAt Miami Dade, he felt the fire,\nA restless spark, a sacred desire.\n\nHe left the West, he crossed the seas,\nThrough trials, jungles, and disease.\nAt every turn, his soul was tried —\nYet grace unseen was by his side.\n\nAnd then at last, he found his home,\nNot built by hands, not carved from stone —\nBut nestled in a cowherd’s sacred land,\nWhere dust and love go hand in hand.\n\nHis heart embraced the Vraja ways,\nThe Brajvāsīs’ love, their simple praise.\nFor every cow, and bird, and tree —\nHe weeps in Vṛndāvan’s memory.\n\nHis hands so soft, his vows so strong,\nIn japa\u0027s depth he dwells lifelong.\nHis sādhanā, a blazing fire,\nHis humility — never to retire.\n\nAmong godbrothers, hand in hand,\nHe bows with love, he helps them stand.\nWith folded palms and lowered eyes,\nHe sees their glories, never tries\nTo rise above — he stoops to serve,\nWith all the honor they deserve.\n\nO Gurudeva, kind and wise,\nYou see the soul beyond disguise.\nFor beast or man, for foe or friend,\nYour compassion has no end.\n\nYou showed us how to live so plain,\nWith little need, no selfish gain.\nWith barefoot grace and monk’s attire,\nYou teach renunciation’s fire.\n\nWith folded palms, this prayer we raise,\nTo glorify your wondrous ways.\nPlease let us serve with heart and soul,\nAnd walk behind you, toward the goal.\n==================================================\n\nThis year, we reflected many times on your strong sādhanā, your inconceivable humility, and the way you love each living being without discrimination. Just hearing about your attachment to the Brajvāsīs, and your love for Vṛndāvana, awakens something dormant in our hearts.\n\nPersonally, Guru Mahārāja, this year you carried me through a difficult time in my professional life. You guided me from within, even though I didn’t know what to do. Because of your teachings and example, I chose what I now clearly see was the right path — the Kṛṣṇa conscious path, not the selfish one. Without your mercy, I would have acted unwisely and suffered much more.\n\nOn the devotional front, you gave us a gift beyond anything we could imagine. The humble space where we’ve been doing outreach — singing kīrtana, discussing Bhagavad-gītā, building bridges with curious souls — became blessed by your divine presence. You came personally, led us in a most powerful kīrtan, and even gave second initiations there. Guru Mahārāja, this was your love manifest — completely causeless — and we pray to never forget it.\n\nWith folded palms, we beg your blessings to continue this service. Please allow us to expand this American-born outreach, to carry Śrīla Prabhupāda\u0027s message to every corner, heart to heart, soul to soul.\n\nWe don’t know how long we will live, or how many chances we will get. But we pray that for at least one full decade, if not more, we may continue this seva under your guidance — not for name, not for numbers, but as an offering of love to your lotus feet.\n\nWe place our lives at your lotus feet, praying only that we may always remember your instructions, serve your mission faithfully, and remain your eternal servants — life after life, birth after birth.\n\nWith love and gratitude,\n\nyour servants,\nSundari Lila devi dasi and Sri Kumara dasa"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n On this sacred occasion of your 75th appearance day, my heart is overflowing with gratitude. By your inconceivable compassion, you accepted me as your disciple—and in 2024, you again showered your mercy by giving me brahmin initiation. I have no qualification, yet you see value in the smallest attempt of your servants. For this, I remain eternally grateful.\n \n Maharaj, you have given me not only a spiritual identity but also a spiritual family—a vibrant community of sincere Vaiṣṇavas who are nourished by your example of humility, compassion, and dedication to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n GOVARDHAN ECO VILLAGE — YOUR HEART MANIFEST\n \n You have often said that Govardhan Eco Village is the offering of your heart to your beloved spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada.\n To live at GEV—even in the tiniest corner, even as the most insignificant resident—feels like you have allowed me a tiny space in the corner of your own heart.\n \n Your two simple words—\n “Welcome home.”\n —are not ordinary. They carry the warmth of a spiritual father receiving his long-lost children. Each time I hear them in your recorded addressing to the devotees, I feel as if I am truly coming home—closer to Kṛṣṇa, closer to Madan Mohan, closer to the spiritual world.\n \n In your classes you often say:\n “The path of bhakti begins when we sincerely appreciate the mercy we have received.”\n Today, I pray to hold on to that appreciation forever.\n \n You teach us that a Vaiṣṇava is one who:\n • Sees every soul with compassion\n • Speaks truth with humility\n • Serves without expectation\n • Remembers Kṛṣṇa in every situation\n You do not merely teach these qualities—you embody them.\n \n Allow me to glorify you with the letters of your sacred name:\n R – “Reliable Shelter”\n You are the unwavering refuge for struggling souls, patiently guiding us toward Kṛṣṇa.\n A – “Affection in Action”\n Your compassion is not theoretical—you express it through tireless service, personal care, and genuine listening.\n D – “Dedication to Srila Prabhupada”\n Your every breath, project, teaching, and pilgrimage is rooted in pleasing your beloved spiritual master.\n H – “Humility that Inspires”\n Your humility is not weakness but the greatest strength—soft as a rose and firm as a thunderbolt.\n A – “Acharya-like Example”\n You live the principles that you speak, teaching through personal conduct more loudly than words.\n N – “Nourisher of Devotion”\n You nurture faith, uplift devotion, and awaken the desire for pure service in everyone you meet.\n A – “Atma-nivedanam”\n Your life is a complete offering of your mind, words, and actions at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and Gurudev.\n T – “Tireless Servant”\n Your service—traveling, teaching, building communities, healing hearts—never stops.\n H – “Homecoming Guide”\n With your gentle “welcome home,” you remind us that our real home is back to Godhead, in loving service to Radha and Kṛṣṇa.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj,\n \n I beg that in this lifetime and beyond, I may serve your mission, follow your instructions, and remain always connected to your lotus feet. May I never forget your kindness, your guidance, and your example.\n Please allow me to become an instrument—however small—of your compassion.\n Thank you, Maharaj, for giving me a place in your heart, a place in your community, and a direction on the path back to Godhead.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Sri Narayana Hari Dasa"

        "country":  "India",
        "Your Offering ":  "Respected Gurudeva,\n \n Gurudeva, I am first of all not qualified to glorify you, who are an ocean of wonderful qualities. But still, I take this wonderful opportunity to offer a drop from the ocean of your wonderful qualities.\n \n Gurudeva, as from last year it was a very wonderful experience as I have got your personal association when you had been to Kolkata. The moment when we met you, and as we gave our introduction and spoke about Jamshedpur and the program which was scheduled for you to visit there in the coming days, you immediately asked us whether we were going to be there when you were visiting. I felt so sheltered that you did not ignore us, although it was just a small piece of information. Thank you, Gurudeva, for your kindness and mercy on fallen souls like me. When you had actually visited Jamshedpur, it was like a dream coming true that just before that, some months prior, I had just been thinking in my mind whether it would come true that in the seva sthali which I had been given, I would get to see my Guru Maharaj. Then, just a few months after that, it was like Lord Krishna personally reciprocated on this poor soul\u0027s desire, and that came true. I actually had no bounds to my happiness to see you, Gurudeva, in the same place where I was going for preaching for a decade. During your visit also, we arranged a college professors\u0027 program by HG Gauranga Prabhu, and it was successful with almost 100 people attending and taking prasadam. After that, HG Gauranga Prabhu visited the voice and blessed all devotees and encouraged us for more youth preaching. In the evening, we went for the actual program and got to receive your divine association and the mercy of your glance as well. This all was an extra mercy and boost in our preaching, making us understand that Lord Krishna, Srila Prabhupada, and your Holiness all have showered immense mercy, and I came to one understanding: how I shouldn’t take any of my services lightly, because the spiritual master can at any moment turn towards that, and then I could have become humiliated. But Gurudeva, in recent years, the preaching in Jamshedpur is picking up by your divine blessings and mercy, although there are some hard struggles going on. This year also, we started preaching, and it is picking up, but we have problems from time to time.\n \n Gurudeva, last year in book distribution, we distributed around 3200 books, but of course, I didn’t do much. It was the constant efforts of HG Raj Gopinath Prabhu and all devotees connected to NIT Jamshedpur, who collected funds, distributed books hand to hand, person to person. They worked hard to fulfill the desire of Srila Prabhupada of pushing the books, for if one reads a sentence or a word, his life is successful.\n \n Gurudeva, we are also trying to connect the parents of students connected to NIT through regular classes, yatras, and sometimes personal visits. Some of them are also picking up very seriously to chanting holy names and following the four regulative principles and reading Srila Prabhupada’s books, and also engaging in some services. We have professor preaching also going on, and regularly they attend classes, and some of them are chanting 1-2 rounds regularly, and some of them in recent marathons took Srila Prabhupada\u0027s SB and BG.\n \n Gurudeva, in recent months, we have started college preaching in Kolkata, and we have got a place as of now. Students are trying hard to connect to youths in local colleges, and this process is going on, and we need your blessings to continue ahead and inspire many souls to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada in His birthplace.\n \n Gurudeva, as I informed about the other services I received in Newtown, Kolkata, i.e., deity services and some cultivation of well-wishers. Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga are very merciful here, and they are giving me so much opportunity to serve them in the form of their divine services. I am also trying to serve them to whatever extent possible, but because of my laziness, argumentative mentality, and finding faults, I am increasing their anxiety. Gurudeva, kindly bless that you have given me divine association and wonderful opportunity of chanting holy names and devotee association, but still, at times, I am not taking them seriously, rather I am misusing these opportunities. Gurudeva, in recent past years, we have tried to maintain the standards which we were taught from earlier times. Festivals have been improved by the endeavors of HG Vrindavan Chari Prabhu, from Janmashtami to Kartik month, to Gaur Purnima, to Rama Navami, to Brahmotsava, and every festival, thousands of visitors practically and everyone is in bliss to take darshan of Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga and Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Gurudeva, in recent past months, we are trying to connect all people who were serving deities by giving some financial help and some sort of Bhakti cultivation through programs in their homes and yatras. These are also going well, and they are voluntarily taking up services.\n \n Gurudeva, as per your desire, we need to erect a beautiful temple for the pleasure of Srila Prabhupada. We are also trying to march in that direction to please you and all other Srila Prabhupada disciples. Kindly shower your merciful glances and blessings that we can do something in this direction.\n \n Gurudeva, as my personal sadhana, I try to regularly hear your lectures and HDG A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada’s lectures and get a glimpse of divine association. Your lectures are a great source of my inspiration, and I take so much pleasure and nourishment in hearing them. When Gurudeva, I hear the lectures, I get my radar positioned on track for pure devotional service to Their Lordships and give away all traces of false attachments and distractions. The recent yatra to Govardhan with you was very inspirational. I got back on track my life of pure devotional service, otherwise Gurudeva, as I get along with services and because of attachments which I am maintaining, I make my d.s. a tool for increasing my false ego. But as I attended this yatra, I got back again to the roots of pure devotional service which you always stress, and as I hear from you in personal association, it leaves a deep impression of your purity in sticking to principles, not getting distracted, and emphasis on devotional services, and your wonderful service attitude, and how you are inspiring so many devotees all around the globe, and everyone seeking your association and getting happy and contributing so wonderfully to the mission of Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Gurudeva, I got to see this time your attachment to Srila Prabhupada and the deep separation you are undergoing from Srila Prabhupada. Thank you, Gurudeva, for showing us through your example how we should cultivate this mood of separation from the spiritual master and how we have to serve the spiritual master in separation without getting distracted from his teachings.\n \n Thank you once again, Gurudeva, for all that you have given me. And it is said that we cannot repay what the Spiritual Master has given to us. So, I remain an eternal debtor in this case, but I try to follow the instructions which you have given me through the lectures and try to honestly live by those principles and try my best to never let you down.\n \n Gurudeva, kindly forgive me for offenses and mistakes I commit towards you because of my ignorance and arrogance.\n \n Yours aspiring servant of a servant,\n Sri Ram Raghav Das\n Iskcon Newtown, Kolkata"

By the mercy of the Lord, I have received the rare opportunity to glorify the divine qualities of my most worshipable Gurudev. I offer my full aṣṭāṅga daṇḍavat praṇāms at the lotus feet of my revered Guru Mahārāja.\n \n My Guru Mahārāja possesses unlimited transcendental qualities, but today I would like to speak on just a few of them—those which I have personally observed and learned from his divine behavior.\n \n \n ---\n \n 1. Gurudev’s Equal Vision and Affection for Everyone\n \n One of the first qualities I learned from Guru Mahārāja is his deep affection, respect, and attentive hearing toward all—whether they are his godbrothers, godsisters, or any devotee.\n \n Earlier, I had only read in the Bhagavad-gītā the verse:\n \n vidyā-vinaya-sampanne\n brāhmaṇe gavi hastini\n śuni caiva śva-pāke ca\n paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ\n \n This verse teaches equal vision toward all living beings.\n But in the presence of Guru Mahārāja, I see this verse living and walking.\n \n Even here at Govardhan Eco Village, Guru Mahārāja offers respect and affection even to simple workers, greeting them lovingly with “Hare Krishna.” This teaches us how a true ācārya behaves—not by words alone, but by his personal example.\n \n Guru Mahārāja even shows respect and kindness to the animals of Govardhan, including the dogs. By his actions, he teaches that a true learned person sees every living being as a child of God.\n \n \n ---\n \n 2. Gurudev’s Deep, Heart-Melting Chanting of the Holy Name\n \n When I observe Guru Mahārāja chanting the holy name, I understand the true value of the Hare Krishna mahā-mantra in this age of Kali.\n His chanting is not mechanical—it is filled with devotion, absorption, and love.\n \n Just by seeing him chant, we realize how essential the Holy Name is for every person in this age.\n \n \n ---\n \n 3. Gurudev’s Divine Smile, Compassion, and Humility\n \n Guru Mahārāja’s gentle smile removes all distress and pain from our hearts. His compassion, humility, respectfulness, and loving dealings are beyond ordinary description.\n \n Guru Mahārāja does not merely instruct us—he demonstrates every teaching through his own life.\n \n \n ---\n \n 4. Gurudev Inspires Devotion in Everyone Who Meets Him\n \n Because of Gurudev’s qualities, Govardhan Eco Village has become a spiritual home for countless people. Many visitors come as tourists, but after seeing the behavior of senior devotees and hearing Krishna-kathā, their hearts transform—they begin to develop devotion and become inspired.\n \n This miraculous transformation is the mercy of Guru Mahārāja.\n \n Every person who comes to Govardhan Eco Village is lovingly told:\n “This is your home.”\n This simple statement creates warmth, belonging, and spiritual upliftment in everyone’s heart.\n \n \n ---\n \n 5. Gurudev Performs Every Service With Love\n \n Guru Mahārāja never thinks he is above any service.\n He personally performs seva—whether it is caring for the cows, serving matajis, encouraging devotees, or even showing affection to the donkeys in the village.\n \n Every creature feels protected and loved in his presence.\n \n \n ---\n \n 6. His Senior Disciples Reflect His Teachings\n \n I also learn from the senior disciples of Guru Mahārāja.\n Their dedication, humility, and hospitality reflect the training given by Gurudev. They serve every guest with full energy and heartfelt respect.\n \n By observing them, I understand more deeply the teachings that Guru Mahārāja has instilled in all his followers.\n \n \n ---\n \n My Personal Prayer\n \n I pray at the lotus feet of Guru Mahārāja:\n \n “May your mercy always remain upon me.\n Please give me the strength, sincerity, and purity to serve your projects at Govardhan Eco Village with greater dedication.\n May I always follow your teachings not only in words but through my actions.”"

What touches my heart most is that you do not simply instruct these principles; you perfectly embody them in everything you do.\n \n You are a shining, golden standard of true Vaiṣṇava character.\n Your profound humility melts the hearts of even the most hardened souls.\n Your unwavering mood of service inspires countless devotees across the world.\n Your respect, affection, and deeply rooted relationships with your godbrothers reveal the beauty and strength of true spiritual family.\n By observing your life, one begins to understand what it truly means to follow in the footsteps of our great ācāryas.\n \n I often reflect upon your teachings and feel both encouraged and overwhelmed. I deeply desire to hear your vāṇī more regularly and to dive much deeper into your instructions, for every word you speak offers direction, hope, and nourishment to my heart.\n Encouraged—because you so patiently guide us and make the path accessible.\n Overwhelmed—because I see how far I am from living even a small portion of what you so effortlessly exemplify.\n I am a lowly, conditioned soul with many shortcomings, yet within my heart rests a sincere longing to follow your instructions, one small step at a time.\n \n Maharaj, I pray for the strength, sincerity, and integrity to implement your teachings in my life. Among the many divine instructions you give, one stands out as the very foundation of all spiritual advancement: to become the servant of the servant. This mood is the essence of bhakti and the essence of your own life’s example. I deeply yearn to cultivate this consciousness so that one day, by your mercy, I may truly be counted as your servant.\n \n If I can take even a few baby steps in the direction you are guiding me—cultivating humility, serving without ego, respecting all devotees, and remembering Krishna at every moment—I will consider my life successful. My only aspiration is that one day, in some small way, I may please you by living according to your expectations.\n \n Thank you, Maharaj, for your limitless compassion, your tireless example, and your unwavering love. Your presence in my life is the greatest blessing I could ever receive.\n \n Your aspiring servant,\n Sri Rohini Nandan Das"

When I read your Journey Home book for the first time in 2012-13, I accepted you as my Guru in my heart of hearts right there. Not a single day goes by without listening to your SB class or nectarine Hare Krishna kirtans. I am literally habituated to your vani. I don’t know why, but I simply love your personality. I can see all the 26 qualities of a Vaishnava in you, Guru Maharaj.\nI was fortunate to get your darshan during the Kartik yatra at Govardhan. Listening to Krishna katha at the very Vrindavan through your lotus mouth was a bliss beyond any worldly description.\nA few days back, I heard your glorification from the mouth of H G Yugal Kishor Prabhu, USA. I was amazed and stunned to hear the austerities you went through when you stayed at New Vrindavan for years.\nI am a very insignificant soul staying near ISKCON NVCC Pune temple without much service. I am still fully attached to bodily pleasures, but yes, one day with your mercy and the mercy of your sincere disciples like H G Jaidev Prabhu and H G Radheshyam Prabhu, I will overcome my material attachments. My only goal in life is to be qualified as a disciple of His Holiness.\nOn the eve of your 75th birthday, I sincerely pray to our beloved Krishna and Radharani to give you sound health always to serve your beloved spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada.\nJai Gurudev!!!\n\nYour insignificant servant,\n\nSri Sundar Kishor Das\nCounselee of H G Jaidev Prabhuji"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n \n Gurudev, with every passing year, we realize how very difficult it is to ever become a pure devotee. Our puffed-up egos and overflowing anarthas keep reminding us of how far we are from the goal of prema bhakti, or even the path of it. The struggle is real.\n \n The only reason we still aspire for this exalted goal of being a devotee whose every thought, every word and every action is a pleasing offering to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath is because we have you as our Guru. Showing us the way, setting the example, gently and very patiently nudging us to follow in your footsteps.\n \n Maharaj, it is quite inconceivable for us Kaliyuga products to even imagine that we could have such a pure and completely surrendered soul in our midst, who shows so much love and compassion for us undeserving souls.\n \n Despite your age and multiple health issues, you stretch yourself beyond imagination just to somehow connect us to Krishna, to give us that experience of prema, to help us understand what it really means to be Krishna conscious. This year\u0027s Kartik yatra was yet another demonstration of that.\n \n We cannot even imagine the life-altering experience that new and even more experienced devotees have when they attend your spellbinding classes, and the super-intense kirtans at the end of them. It is literally like being transported into the spiritual world for those few hours. We genuinely cherished these experiences and are truly grateful for them.\n \n Maharaj, your unlimited spiritual qualities, lectures, kirtans, projects, personal interactions, your whole existence are all wonderful, transcendental offerings of pure love at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada and Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. And we are like the highly undeserving, yet highly fortunate recipients of Their Mahaprasad. Our family has especially been very fortunate to receive your love, blessings and guidance over the last three decades.\n \n On this most auspicious day of your appearance day, I sincerely pray that Sri Sri Radha Gopinath may bless you with very good health and many more years in Their service. I also pray that we may not be a cause of embarrassment to you, and actually start tangibly contributing to your mission in the right mood of das dasanu das.\n Your servants\n Sridama sakha das, Priyasakhi devi dasi, Gopika \u0026 Mukunda"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Dandavat Pranaam\n I consider myself truly fortunate to write this offering to HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj, my spiritual master, on the occasion of his 75th Vyasa Puja.\n \n I would like to begin my offering with the day I received initiation from Maharaj and was blessed with the name Sridhar Priya Das. By the grace and wish of Krishna, everything happened so quickly that within a short span of time, I was blessed to have such a great soul, HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj, as my spiritual master.\n \n I still remember the moment of initiation. I went to Maharaj with folded hands, completely blank, simply surrendering to Krishna. The moment Maharaj glanced at me and smiled, I cannot even express what I felt. Those few seconds of his divine smile filled me with immense hope. I felt deeply blessed, knowing that now someone was there — and will always be there — to guide me.\n \n Even though we cannot reach out to Maharaj directly for guidance, through his lectures, quotes, books, and social media updates, we are always connected and constantly guided on how to live our lives in Krishna consciousness.\n \n Every morning, when I start my day and open Instagram or YouTube, the first thing I see is either a quote or a short video of Maharaj. I take it as inspiration or as a direct instruction from him for that day.\n \n I have no words to thank Maharaj for everything he has done, is doing, and will continue to do — for guiding so many souls, bringing them back on the right path, and reminding us of the true purpose of human life. Maharaj has also done so much for the future generations. Govardhan Ecovillage is one of the best examples of his compassion and vision. At a time when we have harmed and exploited nature so much, projects like Govardhan Ecovillage stand as a beacon of hope — promoting sustainability and showing us how to live in harmony with nature.\n \n During my time in Mumbai, when I was staying alone for about 2.5 years while my family was in Amritsar, I often visited the Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Temple, Chowpatty — the divine congregation created under Maharaj’s guidance. The moment you step into that temple, you feel you are home. The atmosphere makes you feel safe, sheltered, and blessed. The devotees there truly feel like family.\n \n I am certain that even if someday my friends or relatives fail to support me, these devotees — regardless of caste or background — will always stand by me. Because Maharaj has shown us that we are all one family, and our only purpose in life is to make Krishna happy and go back to Him.\n \n Honestly, there is so much more I want to say and thank Maharaj for. But I would like to end my offering here with a heartfelt thank you to Maharaj and a humble prayer:\n \n That even though I am not capable, may I be of some use in fulfilling Maharaj’s mission. If I can do even a small service in that direction, I will feel that my life has truly become successful.\n Your servant,\n Sridhar Priya Das"

We love you very much and are deeply grateful for all the efforts you make for us.\n \n Your affection, compassion, and caring nature for every single soul have deeply attracted my heart. I still remember the story of how you would chant the Hare Krishna Mahāmantra even while uprooting wild grass in New Vrindavan, many, many years ago.\n \n I am very fond of your pravachans. The stories you narrate, the principles you illuminate, and the spiritual essence you reveal are truly life-changing. I vividly remember how, during the South India Yatra in Śrīrangam, you described with such sweetness how Śrī Viṣṇu Chittar attained perfection by lovingly preparing a flower garland for the Lord every day.\n \n Your pravachans also give me great hope — like your lecture during the last Śrī Vrindavan Yatra, where you compassionately taught us that we should never become discouraged or morose, even if we make mistakes in our bhakti. You assured us that if we continue with full faith, progress is guaranteed.\n \n Your teachings also give completely new insights. For example, in this year’s yatra, you beautifully instructed us to let go of old animosities — even those carried for generations — and to chant the Hare Krishna kirtan together, just like the animals in the Jhārikhand forest. That teaching gave me a completely new outlook and helped me find solutions for many of life’s long-standing problems.\n \n You also create such vivid pictures in your pravachans — from Śrī Krishna-līlā, from Rāmāyaṇa, from Śrī Gaur-līlā, and from the lives of great devotees — all of which have carved deep impressions in my consciousness. For instance, I remember your description of how all the Ayodhya-vāsīs eagerly accompanied Bharata to bring back Śrī Rama. Your narrations make these pastimes come alive before our eyes.\n \n I also fondly remember your endearing remark during the 2011 Prerana Festival — how you lovingly said that since you love India, and Indians love cricket, you too wanted India to win the World Cup. That simple, affectionate comment won all our hearts. From that moment, my interest in cricket disappeared, and my affection for you only grew deeper.\n \n Thank you so much, Maharaj, for your tireless efforts, your limitless compassion, and — despite undergoing so many personal inconveniences — for still preaching and uplifting our lives.\n \n I sincerely pray to Śrī Śrī Rādhā Gopināth that you always have good health and sufficient time for rest.\n Your insignificant servant,\n Śriramya Krishna Dās."

This time when I came for the yatra at Govardhan, I felt I got my life back by seeing you. I was really feeling that I had gone a little away from you; this yatra has given me another hope. darshane pavitra karo ei tomar guna.\n In this yatra, your every word was filled with great realizations. You have given so much, Maharaj, that I can\u0027t even fathom the depth of that. Every moment you are so conscious of Krishna. This time I found one special thing, Maharaj, the way you were showing your gratitude to the devotees who were serving in this yatra. It taught me so many things, that how I should be grateful to you, devotees, parents, and everyone who is trying to serve Krishna.\n Dear Maharaj, you have been one of the best recipients of Krishna in your life and also one of the best givers of Krishna, also. So many ways devotees are engaged in the mission of Shrila Prabhupada under your inspiration is unfathomable. Devotees are serving the society through the mediums of Hospitals, schools, college preaching, congregation preaching, Go-seva preaching, Food for Life, Annakshetra, Govardhan Skill Centre, farmers\u0027 cultivation, providing prasadam to the lacs of people during Kumbh Mela, Ayodhya temple opening, etc. The list is unlimited. “Krishna shaktivina nahi tar pravartan,” what is said in the Chaitanya Charitamrita exactly fits for you.\n Your love for Krishna is great. Your chanting is prayerful. Your personal sadhana is so deep. Your kirtans are so much filled with nectar. Your love for your god-brothers gives me great inspiration to serve Shrila Prabhupada’s mission with a lot of cooperation. Your love for mother cow gives me inspiration to serve them. Your love for Shrila Prabhupada is so high that in this age you are taking more responsibilities to please him; that also inspires me to go beyond my capacity to serve the mission.\n Your senior disciples are highly qualified. I had the association of HG Vishwaroop prabhu, HG Giriraj prabhu, HG Madhavanand prabhu closely. They are representing you very nicely. I need to learn a lot of things from them. They have given their lives for pleasing you. Their conduct is so ideal. They are one with your instructions. I need to serve your instructions seriously. I am in great need of it. Otherwise, I will be dragged by the ropes of material nature.\n I am in great need of hearing your classes regularly and seriously. Many years have passed; I am not hearing them seriously the way I used to hear them in my initial days. I am being tormented by the waves of Maya from right to left, top to bottom. Anarthas are troubling me many times. I know that your lectures are enough for me. But still, I am not taking it seriously. I need to find different means to hear your lectures regularly. Please bless me and give me strength to take shelter of them regularly. I am personally a great fan of yours, Maharaj. This is what has given me so much strength till now in my life and I don’t want to leave it.\n Since the last 2 years, I have taken service of youth preaching at Goa, which is giving great purification in terms of not getting results and not having proper dealings with the subordinates. Somehow, I am not able to maintain my quality of sadhana and services as compared to the quantity. Please show me the light to make these boys into devotees so that I can please HG Radheshyam Prabhu and you. Please give me intelligence by which I can serve them nicely so that they are closer to Krishna.\n GGD VOICE project has been better this year than last year. I think because we are at that place now where you had come personally around 25 years ago. Need to improve a lot in the quality of devotees. Narhe VOICE was a very nice engagement for me last 2-3 years. Now there are many problems at that place, as Abhinandan Prabhu is moving out to Baner mostly. There will be great problems, I know; for that, I need great strength to deal with all these things. One of the greatest helps I am getting is from HG Damodar Vinod Prabhu in preaching to the boys. He has some plans for the Goa boys also. Please bless us that we make these boys into devotees and get them connected to you and Shrila Prabhupada.\n My personal life is as usual worse; not able to become humble. Not able to control senses. I am becoming fatter and fatter. Need to improve in that and become sincere to take care of the body as a service to the mission of Shrila Prabhupada. I think this will only work. Sadhana is worse, as after Chaitanya Charitamrita, I have not read any book properly. Recently, I have decided to dedicate 2-3 hours of the day for sadhana from 2 to 5 pm or from 5 to 8 pm. HDG Bhakti Siddhant Sarasvati Thakur has told to read Chaitanya Bhagvat 108 times; when will I complete that? I beg for the mercy to feel the need for this. Also, I need to be regulated in eating and sleeping. I want to chant attentively and sitting at one place for 16 rounds at least. I wish to follow some austere vows so that I can remain simple and think about Krishna more. Sleeping early and getting up early has been a dream of mine since 15 years. I wish to get up at least at 3 am. Maharaj, please help; your mercy is the most important for me to accomplish these things to serve you nicely.\n Parents are doing ok in terms of chanting and all. One great thing is they like our Kartik yatra, and their main attraction is your association. Especially, my mother is fond of you. She says that she just wants to hear VOICE. That gives her a lot of inspiration in bhakti. By the mercy of Shrila Prabhupada, she cooked 5-6 items for Shrila Prabhupada on the Disappearance day of Prabhupada. She was very excited to cook for Prabhupada. Thank you very much, Maharaj. It is my desire that they remember you regularly and follow you. Please shower your blessings upon them.\n I know I am not a worthy disciple of yours, and you are tolerating my all the shortcomings. But one day, I wish to represent you nicely in the mood of servants of your servants. Please, please, please forgive me for countless offenses.\n Your aspiring servant,\n Subal Priya Das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurudev,\n Please accept our humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n All glories to Sri Sri Radha Govindji.\n \n On this most auspicious day of your divine appearance, we offer our heartfelt gratitude at your lotus feet.\n \n In the early days of Krishna consciousness, around 1989, there were very few devotees. During that time, Maharaj took the devotees on a Naimisharanya yatra. The path passed through a forest, and Maharaj walked in front, leading everyone. After reaching the destination, you went aside for some time. When the devotees came to check on you, they found that you were removing thorns from your feet. Your feet were bleeding, yet you had walked ahead to clear the path so that no devotee would be hurt.\n \n Just as the spiritual master removes the darkness of ignorance with the torchlight of knowledge, you removed the obstacles—symbolized by those thorns—from the path of your disciples through your personal care and love.\n \n When our marriage was fixed, we went to invite you. On the same day, there was the annual function of Bhaktivedanta Hospital, so you kindly said that you would not be able to attend but that your heart would be there. Later, during the Pune Yatra in January 2001, you saw my wife and inquired warmly, “How was the function on 7th January?” You remembered the date and asked lovingly about our well-being. That care for even small details deeply touched our hearts.\n \n When you instructed us to move back to Mira Road, you personally informed some senior disciples to help us settle there. By your arrangement, they assisted us with the purchase of our flat and loan procedures. Krishna Chandra Prabhu even came to our home to inspect every room and corner to ensure everything was proper. This reflected your immense personal concern for your disciples’ comfort.\n \n Recently, during the Govardhan Yatra, you visited the kitchen and personally thanked the devotees for their seva. You always appreciate devotees, no matter how small their service may be. During the Govardhan Puja Abhishek, when Advaita Krishna Prabhu had the service of holding Giriraj Shila, later that day you embraced him and humorously said, “So, you were holding Giriraj like Pulastya Muni,” bringing smiles to everyone present.\n \n Again, during the celebration at Rameshchandra Goswami Ji’s house, you displayed the same humility and gratitude. When Advaita Krishna Prabhu helped you climb the stage by holding your hand, you turned around and personally thanked him. This shows how you value and appreciate even the smallest acts of service by devotees.\n \n From your book *Journey Home*, we have learned how you always prioritize keeping others happy—even at the cost of your own comfort. At Ramsevak Ashram, you were once served spicy khichdi twice, yet without any complaint you honored it for the pleasure of the sadhu who served you. This reveals your deep compassion and tolerance.\n \n We have no qualification to offer prayers, yet we humbly pray at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Govindji for your good health and long life.\n Please bless us to always remain under your divine shelter.\n \n Your aspiring servants,\n \n Subalgopal Das\n Vilasmanjari Devi Dasi\n Nandkishore\n Sanatan"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna, dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my most humble obeisances unto the dust of your lotus feet. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n On your 75th Vyasa Puja, I offer my heartfelt gratitude and best wishes. This is my first humble offering, and I pray to Sri Sri Radha Madanmohanji, Sriman Mahaprabhuji, and Sri Sri Lakshmi Narasimhadevji to bless you with continued strength and enthusiasm to serve Srila Prabhupada’s mission, while also nourishing us through your vapu and vani.\n I began listening to your lectures around 2016–2017. Your powerful reminder that “death may come at any moment” inspired me to take spiritual life seriously and seek Harinam initiation. By your mercy, you accepted me in 2017. Though I had been chanting since 2000, I later struggled to complete my rounds. After moving to the Bay Area in 2019, H.G. Sukhesvari Mataji connected me with H.G. Shankaranand Prabhu, whose association helped me resume steady chanting with joy.\n As a child, I was never inclined to read beyond academics, but by your grace I developed a taste for Srila Prabhupada’s books. Reading with devotees brought me deep happiness. Later, I found similar nourishment through the Chant \u0026 Be Happy group under H.G. Shankaranand Prabhu. My brother, H.G. Anandarama Prabhu, sowed the seed of bhakti by giving me the maha-mantra, and H.G. Lilanand Prabhu’s classes on The Science of Self-Realization strengthened my conviction. I see all these devotees as your merciful instruments nurturing my spiritual growth.\n This year, I immersed myself in your lectures, The Journey Home audio, and your glorifications by senior God-family members. Learning about your transcendental qualities has helped me face life’s challenges. During a difficult time in service, your lecture on compassion deeply moved me—“We can’t love God if we dislike someone. We may not like what they do, but we must hate the disease and love the diseased.” Those words guided me to forgive and continue serving peacefully.\n In recent years, I have gone through many personal challenges. When I briefly shared them during your visit to the Los Angeles temple, you listened kindly despite the crowd. Later, when you visited ISV, Mountain View, the whole God-family joyfully prepared to welcome you. My son Suraj and I felt immensely blessed to serve together during your visit and experience the joy your presence brings.\n Recently, a Godbrother advised me to seek a siksha guru for ongoing spiritual guidance. I humbly request, Guru Maharaj, that you kindly consider establishing the counselor system for disciples outside India, so that devotees like myself may receive regular support and accountability.\n I am currently torn between continuing my material education and dedicating more time to temple services and Bhakti Vaibhav study. Due to circumstances, I have chosen to continue studying but pray for the vision to see it as service to Krishna. With age and limited strength, I long to engage more directly in devotional service. I pray for your mercy to help me balance my responsibilities and dedicate all my efforts—spiritual and material—as offerings to you and the Lord.\n Earlier, I once felt saddened hearing that you give priority to Srila Prabhupada’s disciples and their disciples before your own. But now I understand that this reflects your deep humility and dedication to Srila Prabhupada. I am grateful for whatever mercy I receive, knowing it is far beyond my qualification.\n I hope to continue serving you—perhaps again through transcription—and eagerly await the upcoming yatra book. I pray that I may sincerely balance my Grihastha duties while deepening my spiritual life and, by your mercy, attain Sri Krishna’s lotus feet in this very lifetime.\n Your humble servant,\n [Your Name]"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Dear Srila Gurudeva,\n Please accept our most humble obeisances at your lotus feet. All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n  \n On this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Appearance Day, we bow down with hearts overflowing in gratitude. We cannot fathom the extent of our good fortune for being sheltered under the divine grace of Srila Prabhupada, blessed by your causeless mercy, and guided by the loving association of so many of our godbrothers and godsisters. By your unlimited compassion, you are teaching us, showing us, and leading us with the very essence of spirituality. You are a reservoir of divine qualities and streams of nectarean wisdom continually flow from your lotus mouth, cleansing and nourishing our hearts. Your oceanic compassion showers even the most fallen souls like us, giving us an opportunity to relish the path of devotion. We are just insignificant and have nothing worthy to offer, but with folded hands, we beg the following from you:\n  \n · May we chant the Holy Names with sincerity: Your absorption in chanting the Holy Names and singing kirtan from the core of your heart inspires us beyond measure. When once asked about your favourite sweet, you replied that the Hare Krishna Mahamantra is the sweetest of all sweets, for it offers the greatest flavour to the heart and the ecstasy of unmotivated and uninterrupted loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. We are awestruck with your natural attachment for the narration of eternal pastimes of the Lord and His devotees. O Gurudeva, kindly bless us to constantly endeavour to hear Krishna Katha with attention and to chant the Holy Names with strong faith and deep feeling.\n \n · May we serve the Lord and His devotees with humility: Your life is a living scripture that teaches us true humility. We remain eternally grateful for the way you express your love through the selfless spirit of menial service to please Krishna. We are reminded of the days you tirelessly served as a pujari, worshipping the Deities, caring for the cows, hardly even sleeping, and offering everything for the pleasure of the Lord. You often narrate the pastimes of Sridhara Kolaveca, Suklambar Brahmacari, and Ghanashyam Baba, urging us to realize that the highest position in the world is to be the servant of the servant, devoid of false ego and free from personal motivation. O Gurudeva, let our consciousness, desires, words, and actions align with this ideal, to be eager and joyful to serve with no expectation of anything from anyone in return.\n \n · May we live with responsibility and share Srila Prabhupada’s teachings with integrity: We are amazed by your unwavering dedication to glorify Srila Prabhupada. Your determination to manifest Srila Prabhupada’s instructions in tangible form, whether in nurturing the spiritual atmosphere of GEV or establishing monumental offerings in Kolkata, fills our hearts with unlimited reverence. O Gurudeva, please empower us to embrace every word of Srila Prabhupada with a sense of urgency, seriousness, and responsibility. May our lives become instruments to serve you faithfully and with full integrity.\n  \n Our heartfelt prayers at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath to always keep you in good health. May They continually fill us with the mercy of your blessed association, and may They grant us to imbibe even a fraction of your mood and mission, living only to please Srila Prabhupada and serve your vision. On this sacred day, we pray for the strength to follow your footsteps, to uphold your teachings, and to remain strongly connected to your lotus feet.\n \n Your aspiring servants,\n Subhangi \u0026 Seshadri \n Subhadra Priti DD\n Sudhir Gopal Das"

When I picture your face reading this, all my thoughts disappear. There are so many feelings, but no words for any of it. What can words possibly convey which you might not already know? The efforts are useless, still I am trying. I don\u0027t know why, but I\u0027m doing this.\n\nI don\u0027t even know how to write an offering, or what we are supposed to write, or how. I don\u0027t know any rasa or tattva, or any etiquette. This is all very new to me, yet somehow familiar as well...\n\nAll I know is that this stone heart of mine melts every time I think of you or hear you or your glories. Your words and your example gently lead me to my true self, towards self-realization and realization of God ultimately.\n\nSince day one, you were so surrendered and so humble and so desperate for Krishna. You have in you the two qualities Prabhupada says are present in a perfect spiritual master — strong determination like a soldier and a heart as soft as a Bengali mother. Through tolerating hardships and accepting challenges, as well as through your humor and profound compassion, you have brought thousands of wandering souls to the shelter of the lotus feet of Sri Sri Gaura Nitai. You have dedicated your whole entire life to Srila Prabhupada and his mission, and you continue to serve him and, while doing so, move millions of hearts. Mine happens to be one of those.\n\nI am still clueless what I\u0027m trying to say — maybe this is my way of reaching out to your lotus feet. Thinking of serving Krishna is a far-fetched reality for me. I\u0027m so insignificant; I don\u0027t know what I could possibly do for Mahaprabhu and his sankirtan mission. But if I am able to assist you even a bit in your service to Srila Prabhupada, my life would be successful.\n\nI don\u0027t know about one life back home, back to Godhead. I may go to Goloka in this lifetime, or maybe take many more births; I don\u0027t want to think of all that. But in this moment, when my body and mind seem a little favorable, I just want to offer myself at your lotus feet. I want to offer my life to you. I don\u0027t know if I will ever get the fortune to become your servant formally by taking initiation from you, or if I will ever get your direct association. But in my heart, I\u0027m already your menial servant, and I will always try to remember your words and follow them to benefit from your true association and live a life that is favorable and pleasing to you.\n\nI will strive for perfection in each of my services and strive to serve and please all the Vaishnavas and preach this glorious mission as much as I can with all the ability I have. You would love to see the qualities of humility and tolerance in your servant; I can\u0027t cultivate them on my own, but I will surely beg to attain them, and beg that this verse, “tṛṇād api sunīcena taror iva sahiṣṇunā, amāninā mānadena kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ,” is the foundation of my life. I might fail, but I won\u0027t ever stop trying to chant attentively in the right mood.\n\nI don\u0027t trust myself enough to promise all this, but I can say that I will try my best.\nI have nothing else to offer, Maharaj Ji, please accept this.\nPlease accept me.\n\nYour eternal servant."

I can’t believe the degree to which my life has transformed. By your grace, you sent your representatives, HG Radheshyam Prabhuji and HG Tamal Govind Prabhuji, to pick me up from the ocean of nescience and place me at the care of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath and Sri Sri Nimai Nitai.\n I am also really grateful for allowing me to come to this year’s Kartik Yatra at Giriraj Govardhan Dham. Although I expressed no significant desire to receive your association, you were so kind as to send devotees who made me develop a strong desire to come for the yatra, take me to GEV and make me pray to Govardhan there, and also arrange a substitution for me. This year was my first Kartik Yatra, and it was a truly memorable one and the best part of the yatra for getting absorbed in your sweet and ecstatic kirtans!\n \n I was introduced to Kṛṣṇa Consciousness not more than a couple of years ago, and you have showered such great fortune on me that I got so many wonderful opportunities to serve you and the mission of Śrila Prabhupāda. Last summer, I got the chance to render some intense services in our SPW PDW 2025 camp for this year’s Nakuls, and that experience was mind-blowing. Over the span of two months there, I got to learn so many things and to also assist in the preaching of IIT Bombay, one of your cherished colleges for preaching. Even this year, devotees have kindly engaged me in whatever little service possible, and I am truly indebted to you for that.\n \n One thing that I am really blessed to have is the vast ocean of your lectures. HG Tamal Govind Prabhuji mentioned many times that whatever problem we are facing, you have given at least a few lectures on every topic. So we just have to type our anarthas, and we get the direct association of your divine vāṇī, instantaneously! But it is my misfortune and laziness that I have not been able to properly cultivate hearing from you, and I beg you to please give me the desire to regularly hear your vāṇī and overcome my anarthas. Lately, I have been struggling with lust, because of which my focus on Kṛṣṇa Consciousness has reduced. And due to anarthas like envy, anger, and pride, my relationship with other Vaiṣṇavas has been spoiled.\n \n On this auspicious day, I sincerely pray to you to give me the strength to overcome these anarthas and to be engaged eternally in the service of your lotus feet. Please bless me that I can become a humble servant of your servants in serving the mission of Śrila Prabhupāda and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to spread the holy name of Kṛṣṇa throughout the world.\n \n Your aspiring servant,\n Sujit"

I am here trying to serve you in separation from you. Although at present you are both in your vapu and vani, not everyone has the opportunity to serve you in vapu. While serving your vani, we reach out to the innocent and ignorant masses and make them chant Hare Krishna, or they chant along with us. I am sure you become satisfied that we all are benefitted.\n\nYour long kirtans into the late hours of the night reverberate in our vehicles while we are driving, while we settle down to rest in the night, or while we are doing kirtan ourselves. Your memories come to our hearts, and we remember how you drown us all in calmness and bliss with the chants of Hare Krishna. It always rings in my ears the two things you said years ago when we had your association in Kurukshetra.\n\nOne time in Singhal’s house, you said in quietude, “I am willing to help you to fulfill your desire to serve Srila Prabhupada, his ISKCON Movement.” This was when my issue was not getting sorted out in the GBC meetings. Although I wasn’t exactly your disciple, nevertheless, you had never discriminated and have always shown compassion to help me in my spiritual life.\n\nSecond time, when you had reinitiated me in my sanyas order of life, formalizing my position in ISKCON. That was in Jyotisar of Kurukshetra, in the presence of all the temple devotees. You had said, “I want to see you serve Srila Prabhupada to your heart’s content.”\n\nThe time I had spent with you was my fortune, which isn’t possible now, be it with you on your tours in the US, Athens, Pittsburg, Cincinnati, and Columbus. And your merciful stay with us in Kurukshetra, encouraging me and enlivening us. These memories keep me staying focused in my sadhana and service. It isn’t imitating you but following your humble example of how you offenselessly move among devotees all over the world. Your mood of servant of the devotees and your humble demeanor make you comfortable and accommodate one and all. It is a simple yet a great lesson for our lives, at least for me, how to continue as a devotee in this world.\n\nDear Maharaj, please give a drop of your mercy on a struggling soul like myself. That will drive me in bhakti till the end of this body. Although I am far away from you physically, your remembrance helps me serve you through ISKCON life after life. I pray to stay under you, rendering service. Grateful for everything and am indebted to you.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nSukadeva Swami"

Adhikeshava Prabhuji to do something about my marriage. So many sweet memories I have about your interaction with me. The very fact you would again \u0026 again ask me about my well-being gave me courage to serve.\n \n You once told me in your room that you had officially accepted me as your daughter. That was so soothing to my heart \u0026 soul. All these are my cherished memories which I will forever preserve \u0026 not be tired of sharing with anyone again \u0026 again.\n \n You had lovingly named my son Vishwanath of your own choice.

Once, just to please me, when my son was just an infant \u0026 we were in the temple hall, \u0026 he was lying down \u0026 I was sitting near him \u0026 chanting, you came \u0026 started playing with him for at least 8 to 10 minutes. It was so nice of you to make me satisfied \u0026 feel loved. You played with my son.

He says he will be forever grateful to you \u0026 will be more than happy to serve you at any time of his life.\n \n This temple of Radha Gopinath is a living Dham for me. Every time I come, I always meditate that your lotus feet have touched this place so many times \u0026 wherever you are in the world, your heart is beating for remembrance of their Lordships.\n \n When I get some seva, I try my best to remember you \u0026 feel how to please you through this service. After many years, my mom called me home \u0026 she was wondering how I survived so well without any support, how well my son is brought up with so many values. Then I showed her your photo \u0026 introduced her to you, saying that it\u0027s because of you I have survived well under your shelter as you are my Spiritual Master \u0026 also have adopted me as your daughter since 2000. So this is all your mercy that now she is trying to chant one round \u0026 love Krishna in her own way.\n \n Thank you millions \u0026 millions of times for giving me shelter, making me feel loved, praying for me, giving me a different world to live in, and much more which I can\u0027t mention.\n \n Always longing for your ever-increasing love \u0026 blessings, your most insignificant daughter \u0026 disciple,\n \n Sukhi Devi Dasi 🙇 🙇"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances\n \n On this auspicious day of your appearance, I would like to thank you from the core of my heart for appearing in my life 10 years ago. You came into my life in the form of your book, \"The Journey Home,\" just the next day after your appearance day. I remember how I saw the trailer of your book and also read a few pages from the book. I was really inspired to read that although you were born in America, your behavior and the lifestyle you preferred were totally different from the American way of living. Later, when I met my facilitator, I shared with him a few things that I felt inspired by from my reading. In this way, I was first introduced to you. As you quite often recollect and quote various special incidents in relation to Srila Prabhupada. This year is very special for me as it has been 10 years since I first got in touch with you. Over these years, my connection with you has deepened by hearing your lectures, associating with your disciples, and hearing from them about you.\n \n It has been just a year since I received initiation from you in December 2024. How unworthy, fallen, and unqualified I am; but still, out of your causeless mercy, you accepted me. And in accepting me, you have given me such a big responsibility. A responsibility to keep up my vows I have taken, a commitment to follow the four regulative principles, a commitment to chant my rounds as attentively as possible, a commitment to act in the mood of a servant of the servant of the servant, a commitment to remain a brahmacari throughout my life which I personally took, a responsibility to act exemplarily, a responsibility to read the books of Srila Prabhupada regularly, a responsibility to assist in the preaching mission of Srila Prabhupada, a responsibility to carry on with sincerity, seriousness, and most importantly, without any ulterior motives, and a responsibility to develop deep Vaishnava relationships amongst each other. Such a responsibility and commitment not just for a day or a week or a month or a year, but throughout my life. To be a disciple doesn\u0027t only mean to have some special interactions with one\u0027s Guru but most importantly to actually take his instructions very seriously to the core of one\u0027s heart: as Srila Narottam Das Thakur says, \"guru mukha padma vakya cittete koriya aikya ara na kariho mane asa…\". Even Srila Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur says that \"yasya prasadad bhagavad prasado…\" only by pleasing the spiritual master can one please Krishna. When the spiritual master is displeased, there is only havoc in the life of a disciple. One may externally do a lot of things; however, if those acts displease you, then what\u0027s the use? As unqualified as I am, I seek your blessings so that I can truly follow the instructions you have given us throughout my life. As days are passing and seeing the strong influence of Kaliyuga, it\u0027s truly very, very challenging and almost impossible to keep up to one\u0027s sacred vows unless one is regularly associating with serious devotees and performing strict sadhana. I intensely pray that I could truly please you by keeping up with my vows and strive to share this message with others.\n \n Dear Guru Maharaj, the recent Kartik Yatra at Sri Govardhan Dham was such a great memory and experience which has etched within my mind. As you mentioned to us in your classes, I do wish that this memory be carried throughout this life and across all the lives I may remain within this material world. Let me always remain your humble servant engaged in your service life after life.\n \n Your servant,\n Sukumara Gauranga Das"

You have totally influenced me with all your qualities. Your simplicity, humility, foresight, lectures, and knowledge on the shastras, answers to questions, everything is so exemplary that not only me but anyone who meets or hears you once will be a fan of yours. So elaborating any of the qualities is like showing a lamp to the sun.\n\nSince we are not so fortunate to see you often, the one thing which we get abundantly is your vani. I have been listening to your classes for years now. Every lecture is a masterpiece in itself. There is so much clarity and depth in the subject that even a fool like me is able to understand the message and outcome. You pour out your heart in every lecture to make it so easy to understand for us. I wonder how much pain you take to prepare for the classes so that it is easily understandable to all of us. When we speak to other disciples of ISKCON Gurus, they also have the opinion that the way you explain the subject matter in your classes is unparalleled. Particularly when you speak about Gaur Lila, it goes to a different level. Your classes on the life and pastimes of Gauranga Mahaprabhu are not lectures; they are live commentaries. In Mahabharat, Sanjaya was given divya drishti to see and describe the Kurukshetra war. I am sure you have been empowered with the same divya drishti by Prabhupada and Guru parampara to look into the past in the time of Gauranga Mahaprabhu. The way you describe every minute detail is unbelievable; it cannot happen unless one is physically present there. It seems you can talk endlessly for hours and days on the life and glories of Mahaprabhu. More than that, every time we listen to the same lectures, there is some different realization which we might have missed the last time. Please bless me so that I can increase my taste in the holy name and be able to serve in the mission of Prabhupada.\n\nWe pray to Radha Madhav to bless you with good health so that we are able to have your association and listen to the nectarian lectures in the decades to come.\n\nYour aspiring Servant,\nSumanta Ghosh"

        "Your Offering ":  "Respected Guru Maharaja, Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\nAll glory to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to Sri Sri Guru and Gauranga.\n\nGuru Maharaj, you are a sincere follower of Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nSo, there is a verse from SB, which glorifies the Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu but you are a sincere follower of Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu so it applies to you also\n\ntyaktvā su-dustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīṁ\ndharmiṣṭha ārya-vacasā yad agād araṇyam\nmāyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam anvadhāvad\nvande mahā-puruṣa te caraṇāravindam SB 11.5.34\n\nIt states that Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave up his beautiful young wife and all opulence which are aspired by even heavenly demigods and which is very difficult to give up. Similarly, you are born in America and have opulence, but you gave up opulence which is aspired by many people.\n\nBeing cursed by a brahmana, Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave up family life and took Sannyas. Similarly, you don\u0027t want to take sannyas, but by the divine arrangement of the Lord, you gave up everything and took sannyas. Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu traveled all over South India to save conditioned souls from the mirage of material happiness. Similarly, you are traveling all over the world to save people from the glittering happiness of material existence. So, I offered my obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a sincere follower of Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nIn Shrimad Bhagavatam, in the Dhruva Maharaj section, there is a verse that describes the qualities of a devotee who was going back home, back to Godhead.\n\nśāntāḥ sama-dṛśaḥ śuddhāḥ\nsarva-bhūtānurañjanāḥ\nyānty añjasācyuta-padam\nacyuta-priya-bāndhavāḥ SB 4.12.37\n\nPeaceful persons, equipoised, cleansed and purified, and who know the art of pleasing all other living entities, keep friendship only with devotees of the Lord; they alone can very easily achieve the perfection of going back home, back to Godhead.\n\n1 Peaceful - Guru Maharaj, while you were traveling for searching your inner call, you came across many instances where you had opportunities for sense gratification, but you kicked them. In Kandhar, a woman was forcing you for sense gratification, but you ran away from there and escaped from the hands of her bodyguard. This shows how peaceful you are in the core of your heart.\n\n2 Equipoised - When HG Braj Bihari Prji was preaching in the slum area of Bombay, at that time, a boy used to come for the program, but he was speaking loose language and exhibiting bad behavior. But once that boy came to the temple for a program, and you saw that boy and embraced him, then that boy got totally changed and started coming to the temple and bringing flowers for you. This shows how you see the eternal soul behind everyone and not their external situations.\n\n3 Purified - Guru Maharaj, you chant the holy name intensely, sincerely, and absorbingly, which shows how much purified you are. And not only that, but you are inspiring many people to chant the holy name and serve Krishna, which is the mission of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, which shows how much purity you carry by the mercy of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\n4 Art of pleasing all other living entities - Guru Maharaj, in GEV you kept some restricted area for animals, in which you brought donkeys. Those donkeys first didn\u0027t come near you and were fearful, so you told devotees to take care of them nicely. They were fearful because they were harassed so much. When you came next time, then the donkeys were embracing you, and you were happy. That shows that you know the art of pleasing all living entities, including animals also.\n\n5 Keep friendship only with devotees of the Lord - Maharaj, you keep friendship with devotees, and whoever comes in contact with you becomes a devotee or at least starts the journey of spiritual life. Once you went for a program in Scion Medical College, no students came because of a cricket match. Meanwhile, a student came for the washroom and happened to meet you in the seminar hall. Then you dealt with him nicely by asking how the match was going and talking with him for 5 minutes and giving him invitations to Chowpatty Temple. He came regularly and later on became a devotee and then he became your disciple and joined as a full-time Brahmachari servant in the Temple. This is how you make friends with devotees.\n\nThis shows that by taking dust from your lotus feet, we have started the journey back home, back to Godhead.\n\nGuru Maharaj, your life is itself a guidebook for me, so I consider Journey Home as one of the guidebooks for my life. So, I want to mention some incidents from my life where I took inspiration.\n\n1 When I passed out after training for one year in the Brahmachari Ashram, my authority told me to go to the sankirtana book distribution bus, but it was difficult for me because there was no fixed prasadam and location. Then I remembered that your authority gave out a difficult order to do six aartis in a day and at night doing Kirtan, still, you didn\u0027t say no. By observing your dedication, I decided to follow my authority, and it was the most blissful experience of my life in the sankirtana bus party.\n\n2 While in the Sankirtan bus, one day we didn\u0027t get proper accommodation, so we stayed in an open space with grass nearby. When the next day morning I woke up, one devotee told me not to go this side because he saw a big snake there. So, I was fearful; how can I go for nature\u0027s call? But I remembered that how once in 1971, when you first visited Vrindavan and while living in Barsana, in one morning you went for nature\u0027s call and saw a big snake just ready to bite you. In that dangerous situation, you chanted the holy name with great sincerity, and then the snake went away. By remembering this situation, I could go for nature\u0027s call and chanted the holy name sincerely.\n\nThis is how, Guru Maharaj, your life always keeps inspiring me in my devotional service in many instances.\n\nIn one place, I read that the Vani of the Spiritual Master is a constant companion for the sincere disciple. So, daily I try to hear your classes.\n\n1 Once when I came from my job and was taking prasadam in the evening while hearing your class, but I was not happy with the quality of prasadam, so in my mind, I was thinking badly about the cook devotee and offending the Lord in the form of prasadam. But right at that moment, a voice came from your class, \u0027Don\u0027t discriminate prasadam by your material intelligence; after millions of births, we are getting this mercy of the Lord in the form of prasadam.\u0027 Then I immediately changed my mind and became grateful to the cook devotee and prasadam.\n\n2 Once, a desire for sense gratification came to my mind, but at the same time, I was hearing your class, so the voice came from your class, \u0027As soon as you desire to enjoy material sense gratification, all the miseries of material existence start following you.\u0027 Then I became alert and tried to intensify my devotional service.\n\nThis is how I could realize that the Vani of the Spiritual Master is a constant companion for a sincere disciple.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I need your Mercy to follow your teachings and instructions, which is a life-long project for me.\nSpecifically, bless me to follow this verse:\n\ntṛṇād api su-nīcena\ntaror iva sahiṣṇunā\namāninā māna-dena\nkīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ\n\nI joined full-time to serve you and Shrila Prabhupada\u0027s mission until my last breath, but I am going through some opposition. Please, please, and please give me your mercy so that I can pass these obstacles in my spiritual journey towards the lotus feet of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nI pray at the lotus feet of Shri Shri Radha Rasbhihariji and Gaur Nitai for your good health and your association.\n\nThank you very much, Guru Maharaja, for all the great gifts that you have given us. We hope, someday, we will offer you at least one millionth of what you have done for us. Hare Krishna.\n\nYour Insignificant Servant\nSundar Hari Das"

By simply hearing you speak of Srila Prabhupada, one’s heart naturally awakens to devotion.\nYour genuine affection for your godbrothers and godsisters is like the warmth of a loving father who embraces and encourages every child. This humility and respect you show to every Vaishnava is a rare jewel in this world.\nYour unwavering attraction and devotion to Lord Gauranga infuses our hearts with faith, hope, and longing for divine love. By your mercy, we experience that the only real wealth and true destination of the soul is loving service to Sri Sri Radha and Krishna in Goloka Vrindavan.\nYour simplicity is your natural ornament. During the recent Govardhan Yatra, when an opulent arrangement for your stay was offered to you, you chose so naturally to stay in a simple room amongst the devotees. This deeply inspired me to aspire for simplicity and detachment in my own life.\nYou are a true saint who has no desire for honour or recognition. When the Vrajavasis of Govardhan performed a grand felicitation for you in this year’s Kartik Yatra, your humble discomfort revealed your purity. Yet you accepted it only to honour the devotion of the Vrajavasis. This taught us what it means to serve without seeking anything in return.\nYour teachings continue to be the strongest inspiration in my spiritual life. They awaken the desire in my heart to dedicate myself fully in loving service to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath and to walk the path of pure devotion with sincerity and perseverance.\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your divine appearance in this world, I offer my heartfelt gratitude at your lotus feet. I pray that I may always remain under your loving shelter and guidance, and that I may serve in the mission of Srila Prabhupada with sincerity, steadiness, and devotion, life after life.\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for everything.\nYour insignificant and ever-grateful servant,\nSundar Var Das\nISKCON Pune"

Each day, I reflect on the incredible fortune that brought me to your lotus feet, and I am continually amazed by the transformative power of your mercy.\n \n Among the greatest of these gifts is the multitude of avenues you have opened for me to render devotional service. Before coming into your fold, my understanding of purpose was limited, and my actions often self-serving. Now, through your guidance, I see endless opportunities to engage in meaningful service, each one a chance to purify my heart and deepen my connection to the Divine. Whether it is serving in the kitchen, distributing books, or helping in the counselor meetings, you have shown us how every aspect of our lives can be spiritualized, turning mundane activities into acts of devotion. You’ve not only given us the tasks but also the inspiration and the understanding of why we serve, making it a joyous and fulfilling experience.\n \n Equally precious is the association of your loving devotees. You have meticulously gathered and nurtured a family of sincere souls, whose camaraderie, support, and shared dedication are a constant source of strength and encouragement. In their company, I find shelter, inspiration, and the practical application of your teachings. The loving exchanges and mutual encouragement within this community are a direct reflection of your own compassionate heart and your ability to bring together individuals from all walks of life, uniting them in a common spiritual purpose. This sacred association is a true sanctuary in a bewildered world.\n \n And above all, my dear Gurudeva, it is your personal example that shines brightest and guides my path. Your unwavering dedication, profound humility, boundless compassion, and tireless efforts to spread this Krishna consciousness movement are a constant source of wonder and inspiration. You embody the very principles you teach, demonstrating how to live a life fully absorbed in devotion, even amidst challenges. Your joy, your wisdom, your patience, and your unconditional love for everyone you meet are a living testament to the power of pure devotion. Watching you, listening to you, and simply being in your presence instills in me the faith and determination to strive for the same ideals.\n \n Words feel inadequate to convey the depth of my thankfulness. You have truly given direction, meaning, and unparalleled joy to my existence. I pray always to remain a humble servant at your lotus feet and to live up to the high standards you have so mercifully set.\n \n Thank you, Srila Gurudeva, for everything.\n \n Your eternal servant,\n \n Sundari Priti Devi Dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your holy lotus feet.\nRecently, I gave a brahmachari class at Sri Sri Radha Kunjabihari temple where we discussed the four symptoms of envy: comparing, competing, complaining, and criticizing. Later, a thought came to my mind that you desire strongly that all your disciples become pure devotees in this very life and go back home, back to Goloka Vrindavan. For that, we, disciples, need to be free from envy, which has those four symptoms. So, in the beginning itself, before accepting anyone as your disciple, you ensure that they are considerably free from envy by being free from these four things. How do you ensure this? By not giving diksha immediately! As the years pass by, a candidate will compare himself with his other devotee friends, who will take initiation from some other gurus in ISKCON. He needs to become free from envy by not comparing himself with his friends. He cannot compete with them, as he is not initiated; he cannot complain to his counselor or seniors. He cannot criticize anyone. Even if he does that, he cannot get initiation immediately. Thus, by allowing five to ten years to pass by, you ensure that the candidate is free from envy to a great extent. Excellent technique, Guru Maharaj, you are a genius indeed!\nAlthough Guru Maharaj, you initiated me in 1998, I am not yet free from envy, so please shower your more intense mercy upon this fallen soul and purify me quickly. I can only repeat the words of Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur:\ngurudeva!\nkṛpā-bindu diyā, koro’ ei dāse\ntṛṇāpekhā ati hīna\nsakala-sahane, bolo diyā koro\nnija māne spṛhā-hīna\nGurudeva, give to this servant just one drop of mercy. I am lower than a blade of grass. Give me all help. Give me strength. Let me be as you are, without desires or aspirations.\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for your unlimited kindness upon me. There are no words with me to thank you enough!\nYour fallen disciple,\nSundarshyam das.\nISKCON Pune, NVCC.\n11th November, 2025."

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. All glories to your tireless service in spreading Lord Krishna’s message of love and compassion across the world.\n \n On this most auspicious and historic day — your 75th Appearance Day — I offer this small attempt of gratitude, love, and surrender at your sacred feet. Words are too limited to express the depth of my indebtedness to you, but still, with whatever little sincerity I have, I wish to glorify you.\n \n You are the embodiment of compassion.\n \n From your early life, when you walked across continents in search of truth, to your present mission of uplifting countless hearts, every moment of your journey reflects the mercy of the Lord. You have shown how to transform suffering into compassion, how to see the Lord’s hand even in pain, and how to serve humanity selflessly.\n \n Your humility melts hearts, your wisdom transforms lives, and your presence reminds us of the living example of bhakti in this age. You speak not only philosophy but realization. You don’t just preach love of God — you live it every single day.\n \n You have brought Srila Prabhupada’s teachings into the modern world in such a relatable, sensitive, and profound way. Through your books, especially The Journey Home and The Journey Within, you have touched millions — including seekers, students, leaders, and monks — giving them a doorway to genuine spiritual life. You have built communities based on love and service, not power and prestige.\n \n Your every action teaches us the true essence of devotion: humility, gratitude, and deep care for every living being. You are living proof that true leadership means to serve.\n \n Guru Maharaj, you have transformed hearts by your example.\n \n The hospitals, schools, food programs, temples, and outreach you have inspired are all reflections of your compassion — yet your real gift is how you transform individuals from within. You teach us that chanting the holy names, serving the devotees, and cultivating humility are the essence of spiritual success.\n \n Even a single glance from you carries warmth and understanding. You make every soul feel seen, loved, and valued. Your smile reveals the beauty of Krishna’s mercy; your silence carries the weight of divine realization.\n \n On this 75th Vyasa Puja, I offer you my gratitude and vow:\n \n I will try to chant my rounds sincerely every day, praying for genuine devotion rather than ritual.\n I will study your words and Srila Prabhupada’s books with attention, and let them shape my thoughts and actions.\n I will strive to serve others with humility and without expectation, remembering your example.\n I will do my best to maintain harmony among devotees and avoid offenses.\n I will dedicate whatever small abilities I have — my speech, my mind, my energy — in service to the sankirtana mission that you are carrying forward.\n \n You are the lighthouse of my life, guiding me safely across the ocean of material existence. When I feel lost, your voice brings clarity. When I feel weak, your life gives me strength. When I forget Krishna, your example reminds me of what truly matters — loving devotional service.\n \n Your kindness is my only hope. Without your mercy, I have no shelter. I pray that someday, by your grace, I may truly become an instrument of your will and a servant of your devotees.\n \n I beg the Lord on this day to grant you long life, good health, and endless strength so that you can continue to inspire and uplift the entire world. May millions more discover Krishna consciousness through your compassion. May your teachings shine eternally, lighting up generations to come.\n \n Please forgive my countless shortcomings and offenses.\n \n Whatever impurities still reside in me, I place them at your lotus feet and beg you to purify me through your mercy. Allow me to serve your mission in even the smallest way. Let my life become an offering of gratitude for all you have done.\n \n On this sacred occasion of your 75th Appearance Day, I bow my head and heart at your feet — forever grateful, forever yours.\n Your insignificant servant,\n \n Sunil"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Maharaj,\n Please accept my Dandvat Pranam.\n I remember that once I met you on the last Pune yatra, and I was one of the participants in a drama. We were going to perform a drama about the dacoits who attacked the Mayapur temple in earlier times. Just before the drama, I was distributing Mayapur Mahaprasad so that we all could be in the mood of Mayapur Dham while performing the drama. While distributing Mahaprasad, HH RNSM came in front of me, and I took the opportunity to give Mahaprasad to Maharaj. I was having a small packet of dry sweets, which are in the shape of a square shakarpara. I took one piece to give to Maharaj, as the dry sweets were limited and devotees were many. But when I gave it to Maharaj, he did not accept the Mahaprasad and gestured with his hand to put that single piece back in the packet. So I did the same, and then Maharaj gestured with his hand to offer the whole packet to him, and I did what Maharaj was telling through direction. Now Maharaj took the lowest of all lowest particles from that Mahaprasad and ate it, and Maharaj left from there with a smiling face. I then continued to distribute Mahaprasad to other devotees.\n \n Later, after many months, I realized that Maharaj was telling me that whenever you offer anything to the guru, you should always offer 100% to the Guru. This teaching was given to me without speaking a single word, and that too in hardly a two-minute duration. So I feel that great souls can teach so many things if we take their association, either in vapu or vani, with proper consciousness.\n \n All Glories to Guru Maharaj."

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna my ever Worshipable Radhanath Swami Maharaj,\n I am an unknown, insignificant person trying to learn to walk in spiritual life. I am a soul lost in the forest of the material world and completely bewildered and baffled in the attempts of sense gratification. Though I have externally given up my bad habits, the effects of those habits are still haunting me. My mind is restless and mad. Though I love you the most, still I offend you mentally due to the conditioning of my mind, which is beyond my control. Your forgiveness for my offenses is my only hope. I am practicing spiritual life, chanting, and following regulative principles in the hope of being accepted by you. I am unqualified, untruthful, unclean, arrogant, a fault-finder, uncooperative, but I don\u0027t want to remain like that. I have learned the importance of becoming a servant of a servant, the importance of tolerance, humility, and simplicity from your lectures. Your lectures have saved me from many difficulties in my spiritual life. I want to sincerely follow you. I know by following you sincerely, I will attain the highest goal in life. Please forgive me for my shortcomings. Please stop those weird thoughts from my mind, which choke my spiritual life. Everything is possible by your mercy. As Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur prays to Gopinath:-\n \n gopīnāth, tumi to\u0027 sakali pāro\n durjane tārite, tomāra śakati,\n ke āche pāpīra āro\n \n O Gopinatha, You are able to do anything, and therefore You have the power to deliver all sinners. Who is there that is more of a sinner than myself?\n \n Dear Radhanath Maharaj, who is more dear to Gopinath than you? I have neither depth in my prayer nor devotion. My only hope is that somehow you shower your causeless mercy and Gopinath\u0027s causeless mercy on my burning life. Else, I see no hope of deliverance from the clutches of Maya.\n Dear Radhanath Maharaj,"

I have experienced all these divine qualities through your association.\n 1 Humility and Tolerance\n In every lecture, you always put more stress on humility and tolerance – tṛṇād api sunīcena… Frankly speaking, I am trying to adopt this quality when I hear your lectures, but I am so conditioned that with whatever intensity I decide to adopt it, after a few minutes I forget everything and again come back to my original nature. I know it’s impossible without the mercy of Guru and Gauranga. Maharaj, please bless me so that I can follow this instruction of yours in my life.\n 2 Ability to Harmonize Differences Among People\n Dear Guru Maharaj, in Kartik yatra, there are thousands of devotees coming and staying together, and you always start your lecture by expressing your gratitude for each one of them. All these devotees are coming from different parts of the world; each one is very unique. There are so many differences among them, still, you appreciate everyone and harmonize among them. They may be disciples of HDG Srila Prabhupad or may be the most fallen conditioned souls like me. You are that magician who can manage the yatra for thousands of devotees under one roof. Otherwise, in Kaliyuga, a family cannot stay peacefully under a roof. Just because you have this divine quality of harmonizing among the people, you can do it. Everyone forgets their own desires and just tries to serve in the yatra. What a divine, satisfying, and blissful experience it is!\n 3 Profound Compassion for All Living Beings\n Dear Guru Maharaj, I still remember the first day—your first compassionate glance at me in 2012, when I saw you for the first time in a program outside NVCC. Due to your deep compassion towards the most fallen conditioned souls, I could enter into this path of bhakti and could walk on this path until now. The same compassion I experienced during our initiation last year in Dec 2024. “Thank you” is a very small word to express my gratitude towards you. We are eternally grateful to you for accepting us as your disciples, Guru Maharaj. Please bless us so that we can keep our vows throughout our lives that we took at the time of initiation.\n 4 Deep-Seated Positivity\n Dear Guru Maharaj, when I was reading “Journey Home,” I saw how you were taking positive things from every situation you have gone through. You are always telling: “Your experience will depend on how you interpret the situation.” Please Guru Maharaj, bestow mercy upon me to get a drop of this quality of yours.\n 5 Forgiveness\n This is a very divine quality which helps us to progress in our spiritual path. But I am struggling hard to inculcate this quality. Dear Guru Maharaj, please bless me so that I can develop this quality and make progress in devotional service.\n Maharaj, you are an ocean of many such divine qualities, but what can I express with my limited intelligence and knowledge? Finally, my sincere prayers at your lotus feet to give me strength to be a good disciple of yours and follow your instructions so that due to my dealings and behavior, I will not hurt anyone in this world.\n Thank you Guru Maharaj for everything.\n My sincere prayers at the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā Vrindāvan Chandra, Śrī Śrī Jagannāth Baladeva Subhadrā Māiyā, Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nitai, and Śrīla Prabhupāda for your good health.\n \n Your insignificant Servant,\n Suvarnamayi Gaurangi Devi Dasi"

Dive deep into Chanting, Hearing, and Serving.\n 2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Krishna.\n 3. Strive to be united as a community.\n 4. Practice enthusiasm in preaching Krishna Consciousness.\n 5. Bhakti is not about quantity or numerals, it\u0027s about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n  Lastly, You shared with them that - \"Never compromise quality for quantity and infuse quality into all your quantity.\" These instructions are the sum and substance of the teachings of our glorious Guru Parampara. These simple instructions are the essence of Your 50+ years of selfless service to Srila Prabhupada.\n  So, on this very auspicious occasion of Your 75th Appearance Day, I offer my heart and soul to these instructions and make a commitment to follow these instructions till the end of my life, just to please You.

Dear Gurudeva, please continue to guide this fallen soul, and I pray to always remain in your eternal shelter.\n Jay Srila Prabhupada."

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances at the dust of your lotus feet.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n \n Maharaj, you were the first personality by whose concern I was affected around 7 years ago. It was the first time in my life when I felt that I should open myself towards spiritual personalities, and after searching many organizations, your video pushed me to search for this place named ISKCON, where compassionate personalities like you are, and also humorous like Gaur Gopal Prabhu. At the time when I first thought of the material world as a miserable place, you gave me hope. And later, I came in contact with Srila Prabhupada’s family in the mission of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n \n You gave me a chance to be a part of Srila Prabhupada’s family, and now for 3 years, in our own shelter in the home of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath ji. It is the only place I know where I don’t see politics among devotees. There can be disagreements, but the cooperation is in the mood of servant of servant of servant.\n \n When I was studying the IDC course, I realized the position of a siksha guru, and that we are a siksha parampara. For the few years that I have been here, I have been experiencing your teachings through the devotees of Radha Gopinath Community. Their welcoming nature and treating all devotees as servant of servant.\n \n Many senior brahmacaris have given me so much love, which actually allowed me to push myself in devotion. And Maharaj, I really want to go deep in devotion, get rid of the envy I have in my heart. The grudges I hold for some devotees whom I have seen hurt devotees I love. And you are the personification of *Trinad api unicena* and my diksha guru, HH Lokanath Swami Maharaj, as *taror api sahisnuna*.\n \n Without *Trinad api*, I will not be able to love and tolerate devotees and will keep on doing apradh against devotees.\n \n My prayers are not sincerely coming from my heart, but I need your blessings, Maharaj, so that I can stay in this glorious community, in this family of Srila Prabhupada, for the entirety of my life in the mood of servant of servant.\n \n Your aspiring, insignificant servant,\n Syama Vamisidhar Das"

        "Your Offering ":  "GURU VANI\nguru-mukha-padma-vākya\nThe sound that melts the heart and moulds the life\n\nNama om Vishnu Padaya Krishna Preshthaya Bhutale\nSrimate Radhanath Swamin Iti Namine\n\nThank you very much, Maharaj, for accepting this fool into the guru-shishya parampara, despite having no qualifications. It was a very amazing experience again this year during Kartik Yatra. Last year I couldn’t come, so it was almost like attending Yatra after two years. I was so touched again by your mesmerizing classes.\nI would like to highlight some important qualities which touched my heart from your Krishna katha, expressed through the \"GURU VANI\":\n\nG – Genuine Enthusiasm and Ever-Fresh Krishna-katha\n        You always narrate classes with a lot of enthusiasm.\n        You have been narrating these pastimes for many years, yet every story and pastime feels new and fresh each time for you and you narrate it as if you are narrating it for the first time. This shows how pure Krishna-katha is always ever-fresh and never boring, unlike mundane material topics which fade with time.\n        \nU – Unalloyed Pure Devotional Focus\n        Your classes are truly based on pure devotional principles, with no tinge of any mixture, as Śrīmad Bhāgavatam says “dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo ’tra.”\n        Focusing again, again on trinad api sunichena - humility, dasanudas - becoming servant, na dhanam na janam na sundarim - aspiring for pure devotion.\n        \nR – Respectful\n        You are always very respectful to all your godbrothers and godsisters, although you are speaking to many thousands of devotees.\n        \nR – Rigorous and Long-Lasting Nectar\n        Your classes are long and detailed, as Śrīmad Bhāgavatam says “dīrgha-satrena.”\n        They act as the real medicine for the dirty hearts of Kali-yuga souls like me.\n        You sit straight and speak for many hours with complete absorption and focus.\n        On the contrary, I keep looking at the clock, which reveals my lack of taste. \n        \nU – Unparalleled Sweetness of Words\n        The words you use are divine and sweet; anyone who hears them falls in love with Krishna. Once HG Caitanya Charan Prabhu was appreciating your Journey Home book and said you never wrote it in an instructive way but as the journey of a person, gradually guiding people on the right path.\n        This madhura-vacaḥ is another feature of a pure devotee, whose words touch hearts and transform lives.\n        \nV - Vibrant Devotion\n        You are not just instructing us to develop taste for chanting and hearing Krishna-katha but you are a living example of it, you practically demonstrate it through your own example. You practically demonstrate the genuine taste for Krishna-katha. It is not artificial at all.\n        Every class you give is filled with energy, emotion, and deep devotion. You show us that hearing and chanting about Krishna is the real happiness of life.\n        \nA – Absorbed and Analytical Depth\n        While narrating pastimes, you lose track of time — a sign of your deep absorption in Krishna-katha. You never try to cut short pastimes; you go deep into them and fully immerse in Krishna-katha.\n\nN – Nourishing\n        mālī hayā kare sei bīja āropaṇa\n        śravaṇa-kīrtana-jale karaye secana\n                “When a person receives the seed of devotional service, he should take care of it by becoming a gardener and sowing the seed in his heart. If he waters the seed gradually by the process of śravaṇa and kīrtana [hearing and chanting], the seed will begin to sprout.\" \n        You are not only giving us the seed of bhakti but nourishing it through right hearing and kirtanam.\n\nI – Illuminating Guidance and Instruction\n        Your classes are both sweet and nectarean, yet at the same time they act as medicine through many instructions and shake us and awaken us. You so compassionately expose our anarthas, helping us see and overcome them.\n\nMaharaj, I seek your blessings and prayers that I may make your instructions the main guiding light for my practice “guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete koriyā aikya” and practically live by your teachings, always remembering your divine example in relishing Krishna-katha.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nTamal Govind Das"

Taking on so many sins certainly can affect the spiritual master if he is not strong, but year after year, Radhanath Swami is continuing his service to his guru uninterruptedly. This shows his strength of character, and I am proud to be his disciple. Radhanath Swami instructs his disciples to be humble and tolerant, as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did, and we strive every day to purify our hearts so that one day we may be worthy of advancing as a Vaishnava, to be ourselves a humble and tolerant servant, like His Holiness. If there\u0027s one thing in particular that we are grateful for on this day, it is of the warm, kind, and fatherly presence we feel in our hearts when we are trying to carry out our devotional services. As a real guru, his presence is truly felt, and the mercy he bestows upon us as his God-children motivates us to enthusiastically go on every day serving the Lord with more vigor and more dedication to help Mahaprabhu\u0027s sankirtan movement to go on unchecked for all time to come.

Therefore, I am feeling very ashamed to speak to you directly.\n \n I have nothing else to offer you except my gratitude for what you have done in my life. Your words have always filled my depressed heart and raised my fallen consciousness. If I am staying in the temple smoothly, it is only because you have filled my heart to the extent that I could tolerate many small and big storms. Your narration of pastimes has given so much connection to Krsna that I have felt happy for days after hearing one pastime from you. A deep sense of commitment to sadhana for a decade, despite so many changes in timelines, has come from you. And in that sadhana, you have given the process and the consciousness to practice the process. And a very significant asset in my life is the devotees with whom I associate – their elevated consciousness, which comforts, is also your gift to me. Your emphasis on humility has saved me from further degradation into my offensive nature. Overall, my life has been sweet to taste. You have caused this imperceptibly, apparently without your direct involvement.\n \n This Kartik yatra was so sweet… its causing great pain to forget it. Everything tasted very sweet. You have invested so much feelings and emotions on each of us… really, I have never seen in my life anyone investing so much emotion on me. I am grateful to you for changing the course of my life. I am happy in my situation. Kindly guide how I can contribute to increasing your happiness. That will be a great blessing on me.\n \n And also, one heartfelt request, I beg you to grant. Kindly give me your association always… every Kartik yatra. I can\u0027t think of living in this material world without your association. Please stay with me forever.\n \n Tuhin."

Your divine presence in this world is the embodiment of compassion, humility, and love for Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Through your example, you reveal to us what it truly means to live in service and devotion.\n\nMaharaj, I was blessed to have your association from my childhood. Your presence has been like a guiding light throughout my life, silently nurturing my heart with inspiration and faith long before I could fully understand who you were. As the years have passed, that childhood admiration has grown into a deep and conscious appreciation of your unmatched compassion and dedication to Śrīla Prabhupāda’s mission.\n\nI was further blessed to receive your divine shelter on June 29th, 2012, and by your causeless mercy, second initiation on May 3rd, 2025. Each of these moments marks a turning point in my life — moments where your compassion gave me new strength and purpose. You have guided me not only through your words and teachings, but also through the way you live — with such purity, patience, and love that it melts even the hardest of hearts.\n\nI am constantly reminded that whatever progress I have made, it is only by your mercy and Śrīla Prabhupāda’s grace. Your instructions continue to illuminate my path, teaching me how to find meaning in struggle, peace in surrender, and joy in service. You have shown us that real bhakti is not merely ritual, but the transformation of the heart through humility and gratitude.\n\nOn this holy day, I offer this small prayer at your lotus feet — please allow me to become a more sincere and steady instrument of your will. May I always remember your kindness and live by your instructions. Please bless me with the strength to serve your mission with purity, compassion, and enthusiasm. May my life bring you some satisfaction, even in a small way.\n\nYou have given me everything — a connection to Śrīla Prabhupāda, a family of devotees, and a reason to live for something divine.

        "Your Offering ":  "Dearest Guru Maharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to you, Guru Maharaj.\n\nWhere can I begin? How can anyone truly describe or glorify someone as wondrous as you? Each time I have the fortune of being in your divine presence, words fail me; my heart overflows, yet my voice remains silent. And now, as I offer these few humble lines, I fear that same silence will embrace me again. Still, I shall try—like a tiny bee attempting to speak of the sweetness of a lotus whose nectar it can scarcely taste.\n\nAfter having so many wonderful years of your association at the Bhaktivedanta Manor, my move to Australia meant that our relationship continued only through vāṇī. At the age of sixteen, I joyfully transcribed your lectures, which became my compass in life. As I grew older, responsibilities with work and postgraduate studies consumed my time, and eight years passed without seeing you. Each time I did have your darśan, my false ego was mercifully shattered to pieces. My inner desire—to be noticed, to be spoken to by you—was exactly what you never wanted in a disciple. It took three such encounters for me to finally realize how foolish I had been. Yet in each instance, you were so compassionate, teaching me profound lessons through those experiences. And when the day finally came when I no longer desired your attention, by your divine mercy, you gave it completely.\n\nThrough all the years of serving in separation, what always kept me grounded on the path of bhakti were your words and your example. You have touched not only my heart but the hearts of countless souls across the world through your humility, compassion, and deep love for your Godbrothers and Godsisters, and your complete surrender to Srila Prabhupada. Your affection for your spiritual family is so pure and inspiring. Though I may not have the opportunity to serve you personally, I know in my heart that what pleases you most is my sincere surrender to HG Vaisesika Prabhu and Mother Nirakula. They have been the greatest blessing in my life and in the lives of my family, especially my son, Vaish. With such selfless love, they have embraced us into the ISV community, always making sure we are spiritually cared for and meaningfully engaged in service—services I never imagined I could perform with such joy and gratitude.\n\nMoving to ISV was truly a turning point in my spiritual journey, for it brought me the rare blessing of being in your divine presence once again—after yet another eight long years of separation. I am still wondering what the Lord’s mysterious plan is with the number eight! By the loving mercy of HG Vaisesika Prabhu and Mother Nirakula, a most extraordinary miracle took place—they arranged for you to visit our home. Guru Maharaj, such blessings are far beyond what someone like me could ever deserve. Yet, by your causeless compassion and their affection, that sacred moment became a reality. I remain forever grateful for the day you filled our home with your divine presence and spoke such beautiful, heart-transforming instructions—on how to share Krishna consciousness with love, compassion, and a nonjudgmental heart. I especially treasure your words reminding me that the best way to preach is to carefully nourish one’s own sādhana, for when our hearts are purified, preaching naturally flows with grace. That instruction has stayed within me like a lamp in my heart, guiding my efforts ever since.\n\nGuru Maharaj, you have given meaning, direction, and shelter to my life. Even in moments of distance, your voice resounds within my heart—steady, compassionate, and unwavering. You have taught me that true devotion is not measured by proximity but by sincerity of service and purity of heart. My prayer on this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyāsa Pūjā is that I may continue to serve in whatever small way pleases you, with humility, gratitude, and dedication.\n\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for your boundless mercy, for your patience with my many shortcomings, and for never giving up on souls like me. May I always remain the servant of the servant of the servant, striving to live by your teachings and share your message of love and devotion wherever I go.\n\nWith deepest gratitude,\nYour aspiring servant,\nTulasi Bhakti Devī Dāsī"

This is because of your caring and loving nature, ecstatic kirtans and wonderful lectures; the beautiful glance and attractive smile of Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji and the wonderful devotees trained by you, that people are attracted to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Temple.\nIn the early years, you visited homes of devotees, brought devotees together in pandal programs, which was a regular feature on Saturdays, taught devotees to dance in kirtan and immersed them in the holy name and in katha. It is our good fortune that you chose to be in India.\nI love to read your quotes; there is so much to learn from these simple lines. I am just making a mention of some of them:\n\n1. All virtues have their origin in gratitude.\n2. Actual gratitude is the symptom of humility.\n3. A happy devotee is the best preacher, and better than that is a temple full of happy devotees.\n4. Definition of love is the capacity to forgive endlessly.\n5. With faith, you can see the invisible, you can believe the incredible, and you can receive the impossible.\n6. Gold is the most malleable because it has the least resistance. If we reduce our resistance in Krishna\u0027s service, the current of Krishna\u0027s mercy will easily flow through our hearts.\n7. Caring for each other, with patience, tolerance, and humility, is part of what is meant to walk a spiritual path.\n8. Before we judge others, we must remember that the faults we perceive in them are likely to be the effect of circumstances, the psychological response to trauma, abuse, rejection, heartbreak, insecurity, pain, confusion, or disease.\n\nThe last quote, which I have mentioned, shows how keenly you have observed and deeply studied human nature, and how very compassionate you are.\nThank you, Maharaj, for your mercy, compassion, and kindness. I am eternally grateful to you for giving me residence at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. I don\u0027t have the qualifications, nor do I deserve all this. It\u0027s all your causeless mercy, and I cannot thank you enough for that.\nThank you once again, Maharaj.\n\nYour unworthy servant of the servants,\nTulasi Manjari Devi Dasi"

Here, you learned about, experienced, and appreciated the loving service attitude of the residents of Vrindavan towards Sri Sri Radha and Krishna, and others, and it captured your heart.\n\nAs hard as it was, you left Vrindavan and went back to your home in America, and now you are bringing so many people to Vrindavan to access and share that same fortune you received. This is especially by Srila Prabhupada’s grace, because the spiritual master, who is the representative of Balaram, reveals to a sincere disciple the glories of the dham.\n\nYour compassion shows your understanding of what truly pleases Srila Prabhupada and Gauranga Nityananda: to find joy in sharing Krishna with others.\n\nI was born in a Hindu family but didn’t have any attraction to Krishna or Vrindavan. Your enthusiasm and the way you can create the spirit of Vrindavan in the hearts of people and communities awakened this attraction within my heart 18 years ago, 2 weeks after I met some devotees and was invited to your Srimad Bhagavatam class at Soho temple, ISKCON-London.\n\nYou inspire us to engage in devotional service according to our nature and strengths given by Krishna, and your classes help us to grow a taste for the highest service of hearing and chanting about Krishna.\n\nYou pulled me out of my material life and gave me a chance to realize the true meaning of life. Though I am still on my journey to purifying my heart, by reading Srila Prabhupada’s books, hearing your classes, and most of all, applying what I read and hear in the present moment in the adventure of this beautiful gift of life to serve, I have experienced less fear and more love by being on the path of Bhakti. This is especially so this past year, which has deepened my faith in the process of Bhakti. Krishna is real! His devotees are so kind.\n\nSeeing your fearless example of your journey home and how you continue to serve others with a selfless, joyful, and grateful heart, I feel inspired to follow in your footsteps in my own little way for the pleasure of guru and Gauranga.\n\nPeople are so misguided by limitless distractions, incomplete, impersonal philosophies, and unfulfilling paths that lead us away from our true nature and eternal loving relationship with Sri Sri Radha and Krishna and each other, with our service to them in the center.\n\nThere is much suffering that people are experiencing in the world – through wars, unstable economic and political situations, and even within their own relationships, physical and mental health, and lack of purpose in their life.\n\nBhakti truly is a life beyond all this suffering and a path that offers hope and shelter even during difficult storms of life, like the storm Indra sent.\n\nI pray as I chant the holy names, attentively listen to your classes, read Srila Prabhupada’s books, appreciate and serve in the wonderful association of sincere devotees, that I can be empowered to pay it forward and connect others to this glorious path so they can go on their own journey home.\n\nI pray to engage in service that will please the Lord in sharing Krishna Consciousness with others, in whatever way I can.\n\nYou set an incredible example. I am deeply grateful, beyond these mere words, and my life is to reciprocate by serving to express my gratitude.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\n\nTulasī Sundarī devi dāsī"

I remember when you came, so much crowd gathered to take your blessings, and I followed you to the stage. During the class, one of the brahmacharis from ISKCON Kolkata was translating your class into Bengali, and a few times he spoke a little long. After a few times, you stopped and told him that you are the translator, not the editor, in a hilarious way, and after the class ended, you embraced him to exchange love. That was a very beautiful moment. And while you were leaving, one of my senior devotees held the elevator, and you blessed him by touching his forehead, and after you left, we rubbed his forehead and took the blessings from his forehead. By your blessings, I could attend Karttik yatra for 2 years. This year also I got the opportunity to attend Karttik yatra by your mercy, and that was tremendous. You always established Srila Prabhupada through your lectures, and I am also trying to follow the principles of Srila Prabhupada. I remember this year, on Srila Prabhupada\u0027s Disappearance day, you sang the \"Je Anilo Prem Dhana\" bhajan, and through your voice, it felt like your separation from Prabhupada, and I also noticed there were tears in Prabhupada\u0027s deity\u0027s eyes during your kirtan. I completed \"The Journey Home\" one week before this Karttik yatra, and that inspired me so much. I knew you are so humble and full of humility, but after completing \"The Journey Home,\" I realized it is next to impossible to be that much humble and tolerant. How much you tolerate, I can\u0027t even imagine if I had to face one percent of that much difficulty on the devotional path. It\u0027s your blessings that I surrender unto your lotus feet, and please let me stay here forever. I took a commitment that I will hear at least one of your lectures every day and one Chaitanya Charitamrita lecture every day, but I failed to follow. And I know you know this very well that I can\u0027t follow your instructions, but still, you are giving me shelter unto your lotus feet, and I am trying to follow the principles of Srila Prabhupada. For that, I can\u0027t even express how grateful I am to you, Maharaj.\n \n Please bless me, Guru Maharaj, so that I can become a humble servant of the servant of the servant. May my false ego, pride, lust, and every attachment in this material world break into pieces and go away. May I be able to serve Prabhupada and you in every possible way. May I follow your instructions properly. Please, Maharaj, forgive me for whatever mistakes I have committed knowingly or unknowingly.\n \n Trying to be a humble servant of the servant,\n Tushar"

Out of all the gifts you have given us, this is and will remain supremely cherished in my otherwise unfortunate life.\n\nWhen you were asked what is the best gift to be given to you for your 75th Vyasa puja, one of the things you said: “Bhakti is not about quantity or numerical but it is about pleasing guru and Krishna.” You are so expert at penetrating through the superficial veneer of rituals, external conformities, and physical barometers, and you always give us deeper and essential principles to strive for in our lives.\n\nYour heart is so much absorbed in the service of Srila Prabhupada that you get sold out to anybody who has rendered some service to him. When George Harrison left his body, you were saying, “I am feeling that I have lost such a dear friend because of his service to Srila Prabhupada.” You have never personally met him. Only a ‘Prabhupada Man’ can feel the way you do.\n\nYour love and affection for your godbrothers and godsisters is so much that you always keep them on the highest pedestal of your life and always give them greatest priority. This time in Kartik Yatra 2025 @ Govardhan, I could get glimpses of this by being fortunate to witness your loving dealings with HH Sachinandana Swami Maharaja, HG Bhurijana Pr, as well as HH Chandramouli Swami Maharaja, HG Malati Devi, etc. I also bow down to the glorious Vyasasana @ Chowpatty which you designed to illustrate this principle. Thank you for being such a Goloka Man to exuberate the quality of “Paramo nirmatsaranam” and thereby attracting my sinful heart.\n\nIt is indeed touched by your supreme quality of tolerance, which you have shown through your life, that HH Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaja once said that HH Radhanath Swami has taught the world that tolerance is more powerful than protest.\n\nI heard in a class what Gurudas pr commented about you: “HH Radhanath Swami is the most uncompromising and open-minded person I have ever met.” You are always uncompromising on foundational principles of Bhakti but open-minded on details.\n\nYou have taught us – without gratitude there is no Bhakti. I will try to cultivate gratitude for everyone and everything in my life and try my best to give back to whatever degree I possibly can.\n\nPlease bless me, dear Gurudeva, to be an insignificant particle of dust at your lotus feet and continue to serve and assist your servants engaged in the mission of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour son in desperate need of your mercy,\nUddhava Ananda Das\nISKCON Warangal"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Dandvat Pranam🙏🏼\nAll Glories to Srila Prabhupada. Jay Guru Dev.\n\nI am not so fortunate that I could see Srila Prabhupada personally, but like it is said that by getting to meet the son, you get a glimpse of the father, I am fortunate that I got many occasions to see, meet, hear, and associate with a wonderful and amazing son of Srila Prabhupada in the form of His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj.\n\nI beg pardon if it is not appropriate, but I feel so positively proud whenever I get to know and see how you are carrying out the legacy of Srila Prabhupada and extending his mercy and compassion throughout the world.\n\nFeeling so small with unsure words, unclear thoughts, and unframed sentences, but I do remember the teachings of my parents that whenever we get a chance to speak and glorify the devotees, we should try. That will not only purify us but also bestow blessings from all the Vaishnavas. So, with that selfish motive, I will try to gather my thoughts around the gifts that I have received from Maharaj since my birth.\n\nI am very fortunate and always count on the multiple blessings that I have received from Maharaj in my life. Just wondering what would have been if Maharaj would not have been there amongst all of us…\n\nIf Maharaj would not have given shelter to my parents, then I could not wish to have Krishna consciousness since childhood. Thank you, Maharaj, for extending your love through my parents to me since my birth.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for giving us Gopal’s Garden School where I never felt that we were in school. It was your vision that we should have a school which would be like a second home for students. All the teachers, staff, and everyone around was so loving and caring that we never felt that we wanted to go back home. We got all academic learning in a spiritualized way, which has not only made us competitive but also sensitive towards others and made us eligible to contribute to society by spreading Krishna Consciousness in our small, insignificant, but worthy way.\n\nI remember the day when your kind self was visiting our classroom, and you were accepting the small, unorganized welcome from each one of us. I can never forget that moment when I was carrying one small paper sketch of Srila Prabhupada and a small flute with an intention to offer it to you. I was a little skeptical and hesitant to offer, but just like Krishna forcibly took away the bag of chipped rice, you extended your hand in such a way that you got my feeling and desire. You took that from my hand, seen, and blessed me with your ever-shining big smile and your touch on my forehead. I wish and pray that at the last moment of my life, I can just remember your hand on my head and leave this world. Thank you, Maharaj, for always being so personal and approachable.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for giving us Sri Sri Radha Gopinath mandir, where we can get darshan of the beautiful deities of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, Lalitaji, Vishakhaji, Gopalji, and Gaur Nitai. You made us understand and inspired us to believe that daily, Sri Sri Radha Gopinath are performing their pastimes in the temple, and it is non-different from Golok Vrindavan.\n\nI express my deepest gratitude to your kind self for giving us congregational sangat of devotees, where everyone is extending compassion, care, and unconditional love with each other, which they have received from your kind self and your teachings and emphasis on devotee care. Truly, irrespective of the time frame of our ages, we always felt we were there for each other, and you were there for all of us. Your mood of menial serving attitude can be seen in every member of our congregation.\n\nMany times, in almost every lecture of yours, you speak about Vrindavan and always transport us to that place of divine love. There are many devotees in different parts of the world whose only goal in life is to come to India once in their lifetime, and they are working so hard to get arrangements for that. In that sense, we are fortunate that by your mercy, we can easily get access to the holy land of Vrindavan in the form of Govardhan Eco Village, where every brick, stone, and dust is a manifestation of your deep love for Vrindavan. Every visitor of Govardhan Eco Village gets the feeling of direct access to the holy abode of the Lord in a city like Mumbai. Thank you, Maharaj, for making it possible to access Vrindavan so easily with the same spirit of love and devotion.\n\nYou are like an ocean, and I am like a small conch. How much water of your mercy can I hold, which I have got from you, and how much can I share…\nBut even a drop of nectar can save many worlds, so with that spirit, I tried to purify my tongue…\n\nJust like a child speaks a language that only mother and father can understand, so I don’t know what I tried to speak, but I am sure my babbling will help my words to reach your lotus feet…\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for accepting me as your disciple recently in London and for giving me the beautiful spiritual name Ujjvala Kumari Devi Dasi. It has given me greater strength to serve and learn more in the mission of Srila Prabhupada. I am very grateful to you.\n\nI pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji that they bless you with a long, strong, and healthy life so that you can bring many children of Krishna back to Him. Children who are wandering since lifetimes after lifetimes in the temporary and miserable place of this material world. I am also praying that may I never forget your teachings and the wonderful experiences that you always give in your amazing Yatras.\n\n‘Darshane Pavitra karo yehi tomar guna’ but I would say ‘Smarane Pavitra karo yehi tomar bodo guna’. May I always feel your presence in my life, and may I honestly try to walk on the path that you have shown.\n\nThank you very much.\nHare Krishna\nJay Srila Prabhupada\nJay Gurudev"

In every experience and exchange, You could tap into divinity and hear the voice of Krsna. Clearly, this is the definition of a Mahatma. A life that is a sacred offering to the Supreme Lord as against a mere fulfillment of personal ambitions… A vision that sees everything as Krsna’s energies, as opposed to a worldview of ‘what’s in it for me’…\n \n It is truly magical that everyone who comes in contact with your grace has a beautiful story to share… with eyes lit up and hearts brimming with loving emotions… I bathe my lowly head in the dust of their holy feet. Your discourses that unfold the profundities of pure devotional service can transform the aspirations of the most materialistic minds… your kirtans melt the most reluctant hearts, and your mercy can banish all illusory coverings. A drop of your mercy can uplift a fallen living entity to lofty heights of spiritual reality. I beg for that drop of mercy, Maharaj… ‘Gurudev, Kripa bindu diya… koro ei dase… trnapekha ati hina…’\n \n Maharaj, on this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja, I wish to offer our ‘Vidyamritam - Kanya Gurukulam day school’ project as my humble offering… Kindly accept. This is our humble endeavor to train the next generation of girls in genuine education that naturally uncovers their inherent spiritual nature… to help them situate in Swadharma and to dovetail their talents for the welfare of society in the service of Krsna. It is our feeble attempt to sincerely represent and transfer your sacred teachings from the very beginning… to share the happiness, meaning, and purpose you have instilled in our lives, Maharaj.\n \n I sincerely seek your merciful blessings upon this educational project, Maharaj. Your mercy can bring in all auspiciousness. Kindly accept this as my humble offering of gratitude for your causeless mercy, timeless teachings, and unconditional love.\n \n \n Aspiring for the dust of your lotus feet in every birth,\n \n With my humble obeisances,\n Your insignificant servant,\n Ujjvala Radhe Devi Dasi."

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Sri Gurudeva,\n Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n On this sacred occasion of your Vyas Puja, I offer my deepest gratitude at your lotus feet. Maharaj, Your compassion to all living entities, humility, and unwavering dedication to the mission of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is a living example for me and many other fallen souls. Through your teachings, your books, and your personal example, you have illuminated the path of bhakti in my life, otherwise lost in the darkness of material life.\n \n Your firm determination to search for the Absolute Truth brought you to India during your young age. In spite of so many obstacles, you continued your search of God and finally reached India. I am so much moved by reading your experiences in *Journey Home*. When I first read your experiences in *Journey Home*, I was amazed at your endurance in the search of God. After reading *Journey Home*, I immediately decided to surrender unto your lotus feet.\n \n Your life is a testament to the power of surrender. By enduring every difficulty with gratitude and every success with humility, you have shown us what it truly means to depend on Krishna. You teach not merely through eloquent words but through the purity of your actions, the steadiness of your character, and the gentleness of your heart.\n \n Gurudeva, Your presence melts the hard knots of the heart. In your association, Krishna becomes not an idea, but a person; not a distant deity, but the most intimate friend. Recently, I got an opportunity to be in your association at the foothills of Shri Giriraj during Kartik Yatra 2025. I was so moved by your narration of different pastimes of the Lord, such that I felt I was physically watching the Krishna movie in 3D. Your compassion for every devotee during the Kartik Yatra had shown me its power. I personally felt so much awakening of my inner self in your association.\n \n By your kindness, I begin to believe that despite my shortcomings, we too can become instruments of Sri Guru and Gauranga, and I too have a hope of getting liberated from the clutches of maya.\n \n I pray for the intelligence to follow your instructions, the sincerity to remember your teachings, and the strength to serve your mission with dedication. Please bless me with the willingness to put aside my ego and selfish desires, so that I may become a small, genuine servant in your divine family.\n \n On this auspicious day, I offer my heart, my service, and my gratitude at your lotus feet. May I always remain sheltered by your guidance and never forget your kindness.\n Your insignificant servant,\n Utpal Pandya"

Dandavat pranām Mahārāj. Please accept my humble obeisance at Your lotus feet.\n\nOn the occasion of Your appearance day, I want to say something about You, because of whom I will remain indebted to You for thousands of crores of lifetimes.\n\nI want to give many thanks to the devotees of Gopinath who are doing so much service for You. They have dedicated their entire lives to You. I didn\u0027t know anything about Bhakti. Today, whatever I am is due to Your mercy, Mahārāj.\n\nWhen I hadn\u0027t come to Bhakti, and devotees were preaching to me, I saw a photo of You. I was so attracted by Your photo, I didn\u0027t know why I was so attracted to You. That photo was from London. Then I started watching Your videos and learning about You. It wasn\u0027t with such intensity then, but I had a lot of curiosity to know about You.\n\nMahārāj, I don\u0027t know how to glorify a guru. Please kindly accept my offering.\n\nWhen I wanted to know about You, I was in my second year, I think 2021.\nThen I shifted to voice. Then I didn\u0027t know English at all, but by Your mercy, I can now understand Your words. My counselor, HG Jivdaya Prabhu, has helped a lot in this. When I used to pray a lot, asking for a guru, even knowing You, I couldn\u0027t decide who my guru was. Then, on the suggestion of a devotee named Prem Govinda Prabhu from Vrindavan, I wrote many letters to Adi Guru Nityananda Prabhu. I did this for a few months. Then my eagerness kept increasing. Then slowly, I started getting inspiration from You and I saw You for the first time in Ge\u0027me Goverdhan Eco Village. What was that? A radiance like the sun. I consider myself very fortunate that these devotees brought me into this association, otherwise if I had died without seeing, knowing, or meeting Mahārāj, this life would have been wasted. The question arose in my mind: what would have happened if I had missed this devotee association, if I hadn\u0027t come to Bhakti? But it is the mercy of Your disciples who preach with great enthusiasm and spread. Because of them, thousands of youth are coming to Bhakti. For example, HG Radhe Shyam Prabhu, HG Jivdaya Prabhu, and many others. Day by day, they are increasing youth preaching as well as global preaching.\n\nIn the 2023 Festival of Gratitude, Jivdaya Prabhu told me there is a program, and if you feel inspired by Mahārāj, come to this program. And then I came. And that day was the most precious day of my life, a new beginning of my life. In that program, I realized so much that You are my Gurumaharaj. I was getting answers to many questions from the Supreme Soul. Many things were coming to my memory from Your lectures about how we should be grateful. So much, I am unable to even express how to put this feeling into words, but You know it, Mahārāj.\n\nMahārāj, I will assist Your disciples or any devotee very well in whatever service You assign me.\n\nThe community You have built, I realized this when I was at Gopinath Mandir for 7 days. Whenever devotees from Gopinath Mandir come, they leave a distinct impression. You have given such love that is flowing through the devotees to the fallen souls. Mahārāj, bless me so that I can dedicate my entire life to Your service, to the mission of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Prabhupad, and can render service.\n\nI found out very late that today is the last day to offer and there are only a few minutes left, so I couldn\u0027t write much, but I want to tell you more. I will tell you on that day when this festival happens in December.\n\nYour servant, Vaibhav."

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n Guru Maharaj, your example and teachings are extremely instrumental in the life of this fallen soul. Just as an expert doctor treats a patient with great care and sensitivity yet removes the disease from the root so that it never returns, similarly, through your deep and compassionate instructions, you reveal the faults and deficiencies within my heart, many of which I am not even aware of, and you fill that space with the nourishing juice of Krishna consciousness.\n \n “om ajñāna-timirāndhasya jñānāñjana-śalākayā…”\n Only by regularly hearing from you and sincerely trying to apply your teachings in my life, I experience protection from ignorance. But the moment I become negligent, Maya immediately influences me. This is how the spiritual master delivers the disciple from darkness by the torchlight of transcendental knowledge.\n \n This year has been especially filled with your causeless mercy. During my travel to the U.S. with HG Radheshyam Prabhu, my heart held one desire—to receive your personal association, as in India it is very rare for me. And you fulfilled that desire in the very first meeting at HG Vaisesika Prabhu’s home in San Francisco. There was almost no possibility that I could meet you that day, but by your grace, circumstances led me to your lotus feet.\n \n When you received HG Radheshyam Prabhu and lovingly embraced him, I stood quietly behind, simply hoping for your darshan. But out of your boundless compassion, you called me, embraced me, and asked me to sit inside. I sat at your feet and witnessed divine exchanges between you, HG Vaisesika Prabhu, and HG Radheshyam Prabhu, an unforgettable moment engraved in my heart forever. That loving embrace while leaving is still alive within me.\n \n During the 20 days in New York, although it is considered Maya’s headquarters, by your presence and your association, it became a holy dham, daily visiting the Bhakti Center, hearing your Krishna-katha and kirtans, visiting 26 2nd Avenue, and witnessing your profound love for Srila Prabhupada. Seeing how you revived 26 2nd Avenue exactly as it was in 1966, and hearing how you worked tirelessly with senior Prabhupada disciples to restore every historical detail, increased my faith immensely.\n \n I remembered how you were also instrumental in restoring Srila Prabhupada’s birthplace, the birthplace of ISKCON Ultadanga Junction, and now you also brought back the glory of 26 2nd Avenue. Similarly, during the Boston Arrival festival, when you walked with HG Radheshyam Prabhu and spoke about how Srila Prabhupada arrived alone on a cargo ship and now thousands of devotees gather on an opulent cruise, your deep meditation on Srila Prabhupada touched my heart profoundly.\n \n Your overflowing love for Srila Prabhupada, your unity with godbrothers, your care for disciples, incredible historical initiatives, Kartik Yatras, and temple festivals—all reveal your humility and simplicity. Even non-devotees are inspired to appreciate Srila Prabhupada and ISKCON because of your genuine Vaishnava qualities.\n \n I sincerely thank you, Guru Maharaj, for accepting me as your insignificant disciple and giving me the priceless shelter of your lotus feet.\n Your insignificant servant,\n Vaishnav Sharan Das"

You showered upon me and countless others the mercy and compassion of Srila Prabhupada, the entire Guru Parampara, Gaur Nitai, and Sri Sri Radha Kunja Bihari.\n \n Your lectures, personal behavior, and your Journey Home inspired me a lot and will continue to guide me. Srila Gurudev, through one of your Prerana Lectures, you taught me how to pray, and to this date, prayers have become an integral part of my Sadhana. The most important thing is that you have given me the desire for Pure Devotional Service and for going back home to Sri Vrindavan Dham. Srila Gurudev, your deep love and gratitude for Srila Prabhupada instill in us the same feeling for Srila Prabhupada. I really want to serve and please Srila Prabhupada, following your footsteps as your servant of the servant.\n \n Srila Gurudev, in one of your Bhagavatam classes, you taught us, \"Accepting reversals with a grateful heart.\" I continue to hear this again and again, as it gives me strength and the right consciousness to face every situation in life.\n \n Srila Gurudev, on October 19, 2025, Lord Krishna has blessed us with a baby girl. We are naming her Vrunda. Kindly bless little Vrunda so that she can serve Srila Prabhupada by following your footsteps. As a mother taking care of a newborn, Shashwati has to sacrifice her Sadhana and even her health. She is feeling very guilty about it.

You, in my tough times, falls, you have given me shelter and nourished me and gave protection with your lectures. Thank you so much, Maharaj. Thank you so much. Each time I fell, you pulled me out, and you have destroyed the capacity in me to commit offenses and sins. You have mercifully removed the chains of Maya around me which were pulling me away from Krishna. Maharaj, even if I take thousands of births trying to serve you, still I can never ever clear the debt, not even 1%.\n\nMaharaj ji, for me, the main motive to serve Krishna has been this, that this will please you so much, Maharaj. I have not yet developed pure love for Krishna, but someday, Maharaj ji, if you mercifully give me shelter at your lotus feet, one day, by your mercy, I shall develop pure love for Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. Maharaj ji, your lectures and kirtan have nourished me for a long time, and Maharaj, my soul has surrendered to you, aspiring shelter at your lotus feet. Oh dear master, the ocean of compassion, aspiring from you has developed a little humility and tolerance in me.

        "Your Offering ":  "Date: 14th Nov 2025, London, UK\nDear Gurudev,\nPlease accept my soul-felt obeisances at your lotus feet on this very special occasion.\nI am struggling very badly to comprehend how I could put down my gratitude and even more so your glory in few words!\nKrishna says in the 9th canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam: sādhavo hṛdayaṁ mahyaṁ, sādhūnāṁ hṛdayaṁ tv aham, mad-anyat te na jānanti, nāhaṁ tebhyo manāg api.\nWhen I first read this verse during my regular study of the Bhagavatam, with closed eyes the personality that immediately became visible in my consciousness is your brilliantly shining form. You are that perfect Sadhu that I have met after millions of lifetimes in this material world. That you always keep Krishna in your heart constantly is an established fact, but now I know, and I understand fully, that Krishna knows no one else but you.\n\nAny thought of you, your lotus feet, is complete wholeness, and Krishna is fully present in that moment. I always wanted to please you, and for a very long time, this was the main motivation of my existence. But it was you who taught me in one of your Vrindavan yatra classes that the purpose of existence is not to please Guru but to please Guru by pleasing Krishna. Where can anyone in this entire creation find as genuine and authentic a Guru as your kind self!\n\nIn any assembly of Vaishnavas where you are present, envy is at once dispelled by your sadhutva. Enemies become friends, and bullies become sober! You extract the best in everyone, just like the great Mahajans in the Bhagavatam. Not just that, you transform people\u0027s hearts and existence. Please, someone explain to me what else is bigger magic? How can I even start to glorify your good qualities? Where can I start? I feel complete lack. Yet, by meditating on your lotus feet, I gain strength. You never like your glorification, yet I embarrass you every time I get your darshan at the airport or when I get to speak to you even momentarily after your classes or on any other occasion. Please take this as my foolish, childish enthusiasm to share the reality of what I am experiencing. I have communicated to you at least on two occasions that you are a magical Gurudev, and every time I asked you a question in my meditation during my morning reading of Srimad-Bhagavatam, or discussed any other difficulty of life with you, you helped me even when you were a million miles away! How do I begin to explain the specifics? I saw the embarrassment on your face when I glorified you like this last time at the airport, and while you didn’t dislike my honest statements, you communicated that there are more important things to do. Yet again, I dare to glorify you, knowing very well that you are more pleased not with your glorification but with the service of devotees, the movement, and cultivating Vaishnav behavior. I desire to be conditioned to the glorification of Radha Krishna, Prabhupada, and you, oh beloved Gurudev. And because I want to glorify you, I know I will end up glorifying all Sadhus with sadhutva. Please do not consider this as my offense. I seek your correction, protection, mercy, blessings, and empowerment.\nDear Gurudev, you have given us, your disciples, divine Chakshu to see everything in life as an opportunity to serve Krishna, to see every reversal not as punishment but as an opportunity to learn, a moment to intensify and go closer to Krishna. Instead of now complaining and cursing the situation or the person, I am now able to see inside, see the hand of the Lord in the reversals of my life and the people I deal with. I am able to see the bad things of my own heart.\n                                         Denial is gone, and Acceptance is the norm!\n                  Correction is the focus, as Krishna’s pleasure is the only solace.\nWhere can one find such a compassionate spiritual master who can give eyes to the blind persons of Kaliyuga like myself to actually see!\n                           kalau naṣṭa-dṛśām eṣa, purāṇārko ’dhunoditaḥ.\nYou are the walking Bhagavatam and talking Bhagavatam too! Because whenever I lose the ability to see, you come as the guiding light of the sun in my dreams and sometimes in my awakened state of consciousness. You transcend the via medium to help and guide this conditioned soul.\n\nYou give us vision to see beyond! Eyes not just to see the situation but to see the person! And not just to see the persons but to see their hearts. And not just to see their hearts and situations but to see how Krishna is ordaining everything and helping everyone! And not just to see Krishna’s activities in people’s lives but to actually see His most beautiful form! And not just able to see His most beautiful form but to behold it constantly! Be able to be soaked in it. Be able to appreciate it constantly and be grateful. You gave us the entire whole!\n\nHow can someone not serve such a most compassionate and most magnanimous spiritual master who knows nothing but service of his own spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada, who rests not a moment and is willing to go through all pains for the service of his own spiritual master, who can ask Krishna everything for himself, yet chooses to pray to Jagannath for his disciples and put their well-being and progress first.\n\nSanjaya declares: yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇaḥ, yatra pārthaḥ dhanur-dharaḥ, tatra śrīr vijayo bhūtir, dhruvā nītir matir mama. Wherever there is Kṛṣṇa, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality.\nI can with honesty say that wherever there is true remembrance of you, oh Gurudev, wherever there are Sadhus like you or desiring to follow you, there will be Vaishnav qualities, there will be Vaishnav behavior, Krishna will be fully pleased with devotees, and devotees will cooperate with each other, and the movement will stand strong, united, and flourishing. Following your teachings from classes and the guidance of people who follow you gives one the best chance they can get to please Srila Prabhupada and Krishna.\n\nWhen I first met you back in 2010 in Bhaktivedanta Manor, you were seated like a moon on the vyasasan, and like honeybees, devotees gathered around you to drink the honey of your mercy. At that time, I was taking your darshan for the very first time, and I had requested if I could touch your feet to take blessings. You troubled yourself to come slightly down from your aasan and had to take your socks off to allow me to touch your lotus feet. Almost 10 years later, in 2024, in one of your classes, I heard you had done the same when you first met Srila Prabhupada, and Prabhupada kindly allowed you to touch his lotus feet. This is parampara, I felt and feel empowered by it every time I think of your mercy.\n\nI want to glorify you endlessly, Gurudev. In fact, why would one who has the best of jewels shy away from adorning them?\n\nIn our last meeting, when I thanked you from the bottom of my heart for everything and explained how I was so happy in my spiritual life, so happy reading Srimad-Bhagavatam, and so happy with devotee association, in spite of my many, many shortcomings, you became happy, and you touched your heart and pointed to my heart with your brilliant smile. What else can one aspire for in life than the shelter, pleasure, and service of such a most magnanimous and compassionate spiritual master! Yet, I struggle to serve your instructions properly due to my disease of forgetfulness.

Since November 2024, he has been joining the morning Japa call every day and giving us a class on intensifying our spiritual lives to transform into pure devotees one day.\n\nIt is only by your benediction I was able to take my aging parents to Vraj Dham in April and Jagannath Puri Dham in September. Your dear disciple and my Siksha Guru, HG Shubha Vilas Govinda Prabhuji, guided me to plan the trips, so I received the right association and guidance at the holy dhams.\n\nI am yet to receive the nectar of your association during your annual Karthik Yatra due to my circumstances of having a spouse who is not favorable to Krishna consciousness. In spite of her unfavorability, she still came to Orlando with me and our two kids, where I received the elixir of your physical presence, live Kirtan, and lecture that recharges my spiritual batteries to continue my journey in Krishna Consciousness.\n\nI have served your lotus feet this year by having weekly children’s classes on Srimad Bhagawatam and Bhagawat Gita. I am also given the service of singing a Bhajan every day in the morning Japa call. This year I also started hearing different speakers for Srimad Bhagawatam class hosted by HG Shyama Rasika Mataji, your dear disciple.\n\nI fight tooth and nail every week with my wife to allow me to go take association of local Bhakti Vriksha and serve at book distribution programs. My son Nimai, age 9, is autistic but has made tremendous progress in his speech and awareness this year by your grace. My wife takes a lot of pains every day to teach him; please bless her to become a devotee one day.\n\nI am so indebted to you for so much I have received, and I pray to Krishna and Srila Prabhupada for your good health and protection as you celebrate your milestone 75th appearance day. Though I’ve no qualification to interact directly with you, I cherish every moment I can serve your dear disciples, God brothers and sisters, as well as their disciples. Tears roll down my eyes every time I have the opportunity to be in your presence.\n\nI love you so much and wish you all success in everything your heart desires.\n\nYour servant,\nVamsi Vilas das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Śrī Gurudeva,\n Please accept my most humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet.\n All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n All glories to Your Divine Grace.\n \n On this sacred day of your Vyāsa-pūjā, I offer my heartfelt gratitude and my small, insignificant prayers. Though I am only your aspiring disciple, with an unsteady heart and limited qualification, I am endlessly nourished by your teachings, your humility, and your compassion. You are the very embodiment of strict sādhana and pure Vaiṣṇava-sadācāra. Just remembering you inspires purification and devotion.\n \n ---\n \n Your Mercy Reaching Me Through Your Exalted Disciples\n \n My journey into Krishna consciousness began in Kartik 2020. I was working in Singapore during the Covid lockdown when Krishna, out of His mercy, slowed down my life and allowed me to turn inward. This pause became the turning point of my spiritual life.\n \n My first connection with you, Gurudeva, came through your glorious disciple H.G. Gauranga Prabhuji. I happened to hear one of his lectures online and from that day, I would listen to him daily, constantly. His words gave me faith, strength, and direction.\n \n During that time, I lost my job, my health weakened, and I became socially isolated. But what I gained was priceless—\n the awakening of Krishna consciousness and the desire to chant the Holy Names.\n I began with one round during Kartik and by December 2020, I started chanting sixteen rounds daily. This was nothing but your causeless mercy flowing through your disciples.\n \n When I returned to India, my spiritual nourishment continued through another brilliant disciple of yours, H.G. Radheshyam Prabhuji. To this day, hardly a single day passes without hearing his classes.\n \n My mentors H.G. Mukundanand Prabhuji and Parameshwari Mataji lovingly guided me through Śrīla Prabhupāda’s books throughout 2021 and beyond.\n Another priceless blessing is the association of H.G. Anandvrindavan Prabhuji, whose japa sessions on Zoom have transformed my chanting and my consciousness.\n \n Even now, thousands of miles away in Colac, Australia, I continue to receive your shelter through your disciples H.G. Nityānanda Priya Prabhu and H.G. Vasudha Priya Mataji, who tirelessly preach with humility and dedication. Their association constantly reminds me of your mood and mission.\n \n Gurudeva, though I am far away, your mercy reaches me every day.\n \n ---\n \n A Sacred Pastime: The Darśana That Stays in My Heart Forever\n \n In early 2022, I stayed in Govardhan Ecovillage for my 500-hour yoga course. The thought of receiving my certificate from your hands filled me with eagerness, but because of Covid restrictions and your health, you were not meeting anyone.\n \n One day, at a distance across the Yamunā in GEV, I saw you absorbed in chanting. That vision alone felt like a treasure.\n \n On my last day in GEV, my heart was heavy. I had been seeing Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Bihari every day, attending Maṅgala Ārati daily, and now I had to leave. While visiting Sri Radha Govindadev temple to offer gratitude, my mother suddenly said, “Look, Maharaj is here!”\n \n There you were—\n just a few steps away,\n with no one else around.\n \n My mother and I quickly offered our obeisances.\n You looked at us with humility, with a gentle smile, and folded hands.\n It was only a few seconds, but it felt like eternity.\n I felt unworthy and too small to approach, but my heart was overflowing with joy. I knew it was Krishna’s reciprocation.\n \n That moment is engraved forever in my heart.\n \n ---\n \n My Struggle as an Aspiring Disciple\n \n After marriage, I moved to Australia. Here I feel physically distant and unable to take initiation from you, and this sometimes causes deep pain within my heart.\n I feel helpless.\n I feel small.\n I feel unqualified—yet I long to serve you, Gurudeva.\n \n I beg for your mercy.\n I beg for your guidance.\n I beg for the strength to become qualified to serve you as your aspiring disciple, and one day, by your grace alone, to become worthy of your shelter.\n \n ---\n \n My Prayer at Your Lotus Feet\n \n On this auspicious Vyāsa-pūjā day, I offer one sincere prayer:\n \n Please bless me so that I may develop genuine humility, sincere chanting, steady sādhana, and the desire to serve devotees wholeheartedly.\n Please help me overcome my weaknesses and become a servant of your mission, wherever I am.\n Though I am far, please keep me close to your lotus feet.\n \n Thank you, Gurudeva, for every drop of mercy I receive through you and through your exemplary disciples. Whatever little Krishna consciousness I have is entirely your gift.\n \n Your aspiring servant,\n Varsha"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna\n\nDear Radhanath Swami,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at the dust of your lotus feet. I recently learned of the advice you gave to Radheshyam Prabhu – to focus solely on preaching rather than on building temples or other projects. You explained that if we cultivate sincere devotees, they will naturally undertake the service of building and maintaining everything else.\n\nI have personally benefited immensely from this counsel. Today I see your disciples serving in such elevated positions that I feel deeply humbled. Even if I devoted another seventy-five lifetimes to sincere bhakti, I doubt I could equal the level of service you have rendered in these seventy-five years.\n\nWe are blessed with scholars like Chaitanya Charan Prabhu, Gaurang Darshan Prabhu, and Kanai Krishna Prabhu who enlighten our understanding of Krishna’s teachings. Devotional artists such as Radhika Ranjan Prabhu and Janvi Janani Mataji uplift us through kirtans, dramas, and inspirational artistry. Exemplary leaders like Gauranga Prabhu guide our community with humility and compassion. We are also inspired by motivational speakers like Gaur Gopal Prabhu and Ghanashyam Prabhu Jay Shetty, who spread the message of devotional service far and wide.\n\nBecause of the servant-leaders you have nurtured, I find myself constantly drawn toward Krishna consciousness, even though my own nature is lazy, deeply attached to material life, and often forgetful of Krishna. Yet by your mercy and through the compassionate example of your disciples, I feel myself gently pulled back to Krishna time and again.\nThe great saint Tukaram Maharaj once prayed:\n\nएक दान दे गा देवा तुझा विसर न व्हावा\nगुण गाईन आवडी याची माझी सर्व जोडी\nना लागे मुक्ति धन संपदा, संतसंग देई सदा\nतुका म्हणे गर्भवासी सुखे घालावे आम्हासी\n\nHe explains that he desires nothing more than the association of devotees.\n\nMaharaj, I humbly pray for one special blessing: that in whatever birth I may take, I will always have the guidance and shelter of your grand-, great-grand-, and great-great-grand disciples to lead me back to Krishna.\n\nYour fallen servant,\nVarun."

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nThis year I have had the fortune to read both The Journey Home and The Journey Within. Devotees generally read this in the very beginning of their Bhakti. Some even before that. But it took me well over 3 years, and reading Bhagavad Gita and many Prabhupada books, to be able to read it. And as I read them, I could understand and unravel what HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj is all about:\n1.        Bhakti: Having travelled to so many countries and tested so many religions/paths for self-realization, and choosing Bhakti as the highest path is a testimony for everyone that we need not go and explore what is there in the other paths, just follow the highest path of devotional service as given by the Acharyas. The Hare Krishna Maha Mantra was revealed to you by Mother Ganga, is another example of how God revealed the correct path for you.\n2.        Vrindavan: I had the fortune of visiting your eternal home, Sri Vrindavan Dham, this year for the first time on your Annual Kartik Yatra. I could realize that you are the real Vrajavasi who made Vrindavan your home, carried it in your heart, and spread it to the world. I could realize that you remember the exact details of each and every place in Vrindavan, and by your deep meditation, you have replicated this very Vrindavan in GEV. I’ve been 3-4 times to GEV, but now I can truly appreciate what GEV is and what it means for you. By your mercy only, people who don’t know about Vrindavan, or are not interested in it, get the opportunity to visit Vrindavan at GEV and get a very good spiritual experience. I now understand why the board at the start of the Vrindavan forest says that it is meant to ‘remember Vrindavan in separation’. Your stay in Vrindavan was the turning point in your life, and this became the turning point in the lives of all those whom you came in contact with.\n3.        Humility and Service: Your mood of ‘tṛṇād api su-nīcena taror iva sahiṣṇunā amāninā māna-dena kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ’ is the highest mood which a person can have. Just like all the Vrajavasis, the Gopis, Srimati Radharani, the cowherd boys, Govardhan, all just aspire to serve Krsna in the mood of servant of servant, you too have the simple desire to serve all devotees in that mood. Despite ill health, you have been travelling far and wide, just so that you can serve the fallen conditioned souls and bring them closer to Krsna.\nI pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, Sri Sri Gaur Nitai, and Srila Prabhupada for your good health. Although I am unqualified, I beg your mercy to help assist in whatever small way I can to serve you and further the mission of Srila Prabhupada, to serve in the mood of the servant of the servant of the servant of the devotees. Even if I am not like the service and the circumstances I am in, please provide me the strength to endure everything and use me as an instrument in your service.\nYour aspiring servant,\nVarun Padav"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dearest Guru Maharaj,\n \n Please accept my humble obeisance. All glories to Sri Sri Guru and Gauranga.\n \n A few years ago, at the Govardhan EcoVillage, you took me on a walk. If I close my eyes now and meditate on it, I can try to see it…\n \n There isn’t any agenda or plan; nothing pressing to discuss or work on. You just start walking and motion for me to follow. And so I do. We make our way together, winding up and down pathways and roads, sometimes slowly strolling and other times vigorously walking, occasionally stopping to take something in. We mainly hold a comfortable silence, but sometimes you bring a topic up or tell a story. Sometimes I also nervously ask a question or try to prime you for more, all too aware that this magical experience may come to an end at any moment and wanting to take full advantage of this unexpected gift. But amazingly the walk keeps going.\n \n After circling around for a bit, we eventually slip into the interior of the Vrindavan Forest. You seem to be gliding rather than walking now— moving effortlessly from temple to temple, happily flitting between the samadhis and trees and miniature kunds like a hummingbird who knows where every flower is and how to draw out nectar from each one— and you sweep me along with you. You are so clearly at home here, and you seem to be inviting me to make this special place my home, too.\n \n We finally come to a spot by the Yamuna and you invite me to sit beside you on a rock. That comfortable warm silence rests with us again; since time is completely elastic now, we sit for either a few seconds or something close to an hour. Finally, I break the silence and ask you the questions that are burning in my mind: “Why me? What did I do to deserve this mercy? How am I so fortunate to have the gift of this time with you?” Spontaneously and inelegantly I even sputter out: “This makes no sense.”\n \n You smile and your response forever transforms my understanding of spiritual life and of the guru-disciple relationship.\n \n “Love doesn’t make sense,” you say, gently but also with conviction, “it doesn’t have to make sense. I love you and I like to spend time with you….” You go on to speak words that affirm and encourage me, that chip away at the layers of shame and doubt and insecurity that I’ve carried from my childhood and brought with me into my spiritual life. You let me know that I don’t need to be anyone but myself, that you love and accept me as I am, and that you also see my potential and love me as I grow into that potential.\n \n And in that instant, as special as I feel, I also simultaneously know that you feel the exact same way about each and every one of your disciples. That you genuinely see it as your special service to Srila Prabhupada to love and guide each of us, and that you are grateful for each and every one of us.\n \n Maharaj, when I met you I was a child. I was lost, hurting, deeply insecure and uncertain…. Looking for my forever family, my forever home, my spiritual father. You became all these for me and more. You’ve watched me grow up, you’ve seen me stumble and embarrass myself, you’ve guided and corrected and chastised me.\n \n But mainly, you’ve just patiently and unconditionally loved and encouraged me. Without any other agenda or for any other purpose. You’ve kept walking forward on the adventure of Krishna consciousness and kindly motioned for me to follow along. We’ve made our way together, winding up and down the challenges and triumphs. I’ve grown to just appreciate being in your presence, without needing to prove myself or win your attention; I’ve come to love that comfortable silence almost as much I love your storytelling.\n \n I love you everywhere, Maharaj, but I especially have come to love you at home in that magical Vrindavan Forest which you painstakingly created as an offering to your beloved Srila Prabhupada. I love how you glide effortlessly there, the transcendental hummingbird who draws out and shares nectar and reminds us to strive to always seek the nectar and forgive or tolerate everything else. And I am incalculably grateful that you’ve invited me and my family to call that sacred space our home, too.\n \n On this most blessed event, the appearance day that marks your 75th birthday, my family and I offer you our deepest heartfelt gratitude. Your constant love and support continues to sustain us in every way. And we pray to Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Bihari and Mahaprabhu to protect and keep you in their care; to bless you with good health and a very, very long life; and to grant you so many opportunities to serve Srila Prabhupada in the ways that most inspire and nourish you.\n \n Who am I, what do I deserve? Krishna knows—and I think you do too—how broken and flawed I am, how far from what I am meant to be. But you won’t let me give up. Because love doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t have to make sense. Maharaj, I love you and I like to spend time with you.\n \n Your son,\n Venkata Bhatta das\n \n along with\n Krsangi devi das\n Sacimata devi dasi and\n Shruti Sara Kumari"

You have taught us how to transform challenges into opportunities. Truly, you demonstrate the principle taught by Srila Prabhupada that purity is the force and preaching is the essence. Whether speaking to grand assemblies or offering an innocent smile to a struggling soul, you uplift their spirits and kindle their dormant faith.\n \n Your journey from America to the Himalayas and then to Vrindavan is not just a tale of spiritual adventure, but a witness to your persistent search for truth and your submission to the will of the Lord. You have turned temples into homes, and homes into temples, by inspiring devotees to live with integrity, compassion, and devotion.\n \n We beg you to always allow us to remain under your shelter, to serve your mission with sincerity, and to cultivate the qualities you exemplify: humility, tolerance, and deep love for Krishna and His devotees.\n \n We aspire to be worthy instruments of compassion, by reaffirming our initiation vows and helping you to spread the message of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n \n Thank you, Gurudeva, for showing us the path back to Godhead.\n \n Praying to Their Lordships to bestow upon you a long, healthy life to attract more and more fallen souls to the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath.\n \n Aspiring to be the servants of your servants of your servants,\n \n Venkata Govind das and Vrajagopika dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Gurudev,\n Please accept our humble obeisances on the auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja.\n \n Gurudev, first of all, please accept millions of thanks and appreciations from Vasudha and Raaghav for allowing us to participate in the Annual Karthik Yatra. Everything was better than the best that we experienced last year, be it the Kids Zone, Prasadam, or Dhaam Darshan, everything. Because of Your efforts, Vasudha could also develop a tinge of attraction for Vrinda Devi of Kamyavan, and Raaghav for the Yashoda Kund. Gurudev, please bless us so that these kids remain attracted to You and Krishna.\n \n Gurudev, please bless me so that I may attempt to glorify You with true feelings of the heart and not limited to lip service, and without the inner motive of seeking glorification of my own attempt to glorify You.\n \n Gurudev, You are the most transcendental storyteller. By Your potency and spiritual sound vibrations, even a fallen soul like me is not only able to hear but see all the pastimes of the Lord in your stories. Along with showing us the spiritual windows through your stories, you also so beautifully insert the important instructions required for a Sadhaka. One such instruction which I am able to understand through Your Katha is \"Selfless Devotion\". In one of the Yatra classes, You told that \"A devotee does not want to even enjoy Love of Godhead, but because it pleases Krishna, he desires for that.\" Gurudev, even after spending almost 20 years, I am still a selfish servant. Please bless me so that at least I could aspire for such a selfless devotion attitude.\n \n Gurudev, Your Kirtans are like magnets. It is like if iron remains in touch with a magnet for some time, it also develops some quality of a magnet. While we are present in your Kirtan, it becomes so easy to feel attraction for Krishna. Even if I could continue to have a drop of that attraction which I feel in your presence, my life would be successful. Dear Gurudev, please bless me with that attraction.\n \n Dear Gurudev, your love and respect for your Godbrothers and sisters is so exemplary, which we witness on many occasions. This year, during the Yatra inaugural lecture, after Your Mangalacharan Prayers, the moment you saw HH Sachinandan Swami Maharaj, you immediately invited him to bless all of us, and you are able to do it so naturally because your heart is full of love for Krishna and thus love for all. Gurudev, please bless me so that I could also have some love for my Godbrothers.\n \n Dear Gurudev, I was fortunate to have Your Darshan at GEV last December. Out of so many wonderful arrangements and facilities there, we all could feel that GEV is nondifferent from Vrindavan. I could see one special quality of GEV: that You were specially happy there. Of course, you are always happy everywhere, but somehow, to my material vision, it appeared you were specially \"super happy like a Cowherd boy in the Vrindavan Forest of GEV.\" Please forgive me for this partial vision. Gurudev, on this special occasion, I pray to Shri Shri Param Karuna Gaur Nitai that He blesses You with a healthy and long life, and we get your association as our Transcendental Storyteller.\n Your Servant,\n Vasudha, Raaghav, Srimati Kishori Devi Dasi and Vidwan Gauranga Dasa"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n \n I am very happy to write this offering to you on your 75th Birth Anniversary.\n \n You are always grateful to the Lord in all situations because you think that I am just an instrument in the hands of the Lord. In your humbleness, we see that you always think that all the power comes from the Lord; hence, I am not the doer in any sense and just an instrument, which shows your humility. Because you are humble, you are always grateful, as a humble heart is always grateful.\n \n You always try to give all respect to others and expect none in return. You always try to give credit to others, as we see in the Book Distribution Marathon; you always say to be last and also to double our volume of book distribution every year. So, you feel joy when you see others making more than ourselves. This kind of feeling is very difficult in the material world; hence, your this feeling shows your compassionate nature and at the same time tries to give credit to others.\n \n You always value the contribution of each ashram and how each ashram supports and is dependent on each other. In every ashram, how we can contribute to each other with love and care, we are learning from you, Maharaj.\n \n You also have high respect, love, and care for your godbrothers and godsisters. Whenever you meet them, you spend time with them, and how you increase your friendship with them, trying to learn from them and try to implement those things for our temple and projects.\n \n Regarding your lectures in temples and yatras, you are fully absorbed in the loving pastimes of the Lord and His devotees. Whenever you are explaining the pastimes, you are into the lila of the Lord, and we feel the presence of the Lord. You are so much absorbed in those pastimes that we do not feel about time spent and feel like listening more from you, as it brings true nourishment as our heart gets purified.\n \n Regarding your different projects like Goverdhan Eco-Village, Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Annamrta, Gopal Garden, etc., we see everywhere devotees are getting opportunities to get engaged in loving service of the Lord.\n \n There are many wonderful qualities of yourself, Maharaj, which different devotees are mentioning in your glorification, which makes all of us more serious in our Bhakti.\n Kindly pray for all of us that we develop these wonderful qualities in us and always try to please you, Maharaj, in whatever capacity we can, and your infinite Blessings are always with us, Maharaj.\n \n Maharaj, on this auspicious occasion of your 75th Birthday, we are praying for your good health and long life to accomplish more projects and services for the pleasure of the Lord.\n \n Thank you very much.\n \n Ys\n Vijay Govind das\n Vrinda Gopika devi dasi\n Vishnupriya Bhandarkar\n Puridas Bhandarkar"

By your causeless mercy, I received harinām initiation and later the sacred brāhmaṇa initiation, through which you bestowed upon me the rare fortune of serving the arcā–vigraha of Śrī Śrī Rādhā Madan Gopal in Nashik. Whatever little seva I am able to perform at Their lotus feet is solely because of your blessings. Without your kṛpā, I would possess neither qualification nor purity to approach Their altar.\n \n Gurudeva, your entire life is a living manifestation of tṛiṇād api sunīcena—humility deeper than the earth, tolerance wider than the sky, and profound respect for all living beings. By observing your example and hearing your instructions, I repeatedly realize how far I am from true devotion, and yet how tenderly you uplift me, guiding me despite all my shortcomings.\n \n Every year during Kartik Yātrā, when I sit before you and immerse myself in your nectarean kathā, my heart becomes deeply touched. Your words pierce layers of conditioning and awaken dormant devotion within me. In those sacred moments, surrounded by thousands of devotees yet feeling personally embraced by your compassion, I experience the most transformative purification. Those Kartik days in your presence are among the greatest spiritual gifts of my life.\n \n Gurudeva, I have no real qualifications, no genuine humility, no pure devotion. Whatever spiritual aspiration or sincerity exists within me is purely your mercy. Please allow me to remain forever as a speck of dust at your lotus feet. Bless me so I may serve you and Śrī Śrī Rādhā Madan Gopal with sincerity, steadiness, purity, and unwavering devotion. May your instruction of tṛiṇād api sunīcena become the foundation of my life—not merely a verse on my lips but a transformation within my heart.\n \n Thank you, Gurudeva, for accepting me, uplifting me, and giving direction and meaning to my existence.\n \n Your insignificant servant,\n Vijay Hari Dās"

Your humility can melt the heart of any person on this planet.\n You\u0027re an ācārya who teaches us by your example how to practically apply the philosophy of our Sampradāya which is given in Bhagavad Gītā and Srīmad Bhāgavatam.\n You\u0027re the reason that I\u0027ve developed some taste in hearing Hari-kathā and Gaur-kathā. Your lectures are so profound and deep, full of divine realizations which are very helpful for fallen conditioned souls like me to progress in this Bhakti path. You told us that \"Service to the vaishnavas is more important than directly serving Kṛṣṇa.\"\n Sometimes I think if I wouldn\u0027t have got the mercy of Srīla Prabhupāda and you, what would be my destination? I don\u0027t know for how many more lives I would be wandering in this material world. The Lotus feet of Srīla Prabhupāda and you are my only refuge.

So today, on your auspicious vyasa-puja day, I beg you please have your causeless mercy on this insignificant beggar so that I can develop some taste in Chanting the Holy Name, hari katha and serving the devotees.\n \n Although I\u0027m not qualified enough to ask you for anything, but one thing I\u0027m daring to ask, Gurudev Please be merciful on me and bestow your causeless mercy on this fallen soul and accept me as your insignificant servant disciple.\n \n Your aspiring servant.\n Vijay Jethi"

Your lectures are very inspiring to me because when I hear them, it feels that you have a lot of concern for the audience. You want me to become more serious in Krishna Consciousness, yet I am failing to do enough. Your lectures directly hit the anarthas in my heart; it reminds me that I am not following trinadapi... shloka properly. You want your disciples to have those qualities.\n\nFrom your pastimes on this planet, you have set a very high standard for all of us to follow. When I hear your glories from devotees whose hearts have been touched by you, it inspires me more to become more sincere in Krishna Consciousness. Especially, I heard about the five instructions you gave to the senior counselors of the Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Temple community.\n1. You want me to go deep into chanting, hearing, and service.\n2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Krishna.\n3. Strive to be united as a community.\n4. Practice enthusiasm to share Bhakti.\n5. Never forget that Bhakti is not about quantity or numbers, but it is about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n\nEspecially the fifth instruction by you has set a new benchmark for me. Earlier, I had a subtle conception that if I did something big, then I would be successful in Krishna Consciousness movement, and all devotees would praise me for what I had done. But you very well clarified in your fifth instruction about what will please you.\n\nAlong with that, the other four are very important. You have already shown all those qualities by inspiring a large Chowpatty community, and your service attitude to please Srila Prabhupada is not a hidden secret. Thank you for loving Krishna and sharing that love with all of us.\n\nThank you for being present in my life as a guide and friend who wants me to go back to Godhead. I seek your blessings to cultivate the good qualities that please you and follow the five instructions. May I remain a servant of your servants and work harder to please Srila Prabhupada by contributing to his glorious mission.\n\nYour aspiring disciple and servant,\nVikash Kumar"

Recently, in Kartik Yatra, I got the opportunity of your wonderful, compassionate association with more than 13 thousand devotees Sangha. Really, Guru Maharaj ji, in the association of Giriraj Goverdhan ji and all of you loving devotees, it requires great fortune... \u0026 I felt I\u0027m the most fortunate. But due to my bad karma, I couldn\u0027t relish this wonderful event... Just doing prajalpa and Vaishnav Apradh in the Dham... Please forgive me and give me Your mercy, so I should not do these things in the future.\n \n Even though I don\u0027t have any qualifications to perform devotional service, still by the mercy of You and mercy of Shiksha Guru, I\u0027m doing that.

But the bad dog in my heart is very strong, who is always trying to make me do the worst thing. O Gurudev, my only hope is You, please help me; without Your mercy, I\u0027ll not cross the exam of Maya....\n \n O Gurudev, I don\u0027t have words to glorify You.

Although I had heard the philosophy of life, after hearing your lectures, I understood how to apply that philosophy in the association of Vaishnavas. I learned how we need to cultivate humility by cultivating genuine respect and appreciation for all Vaishnavas, at least beginning with those around us. Material life had made me a street dog who was barking foolishly at everyone. Your kind self became this dog\u0027s master and tamed me.\n Although I have never been in very close association with you, still I have felt much more the shelter of a Father, the love and care of a mother, and the encouragement of an elder brother from you. You became all in all for me instead of my blood family.\n \n Gurudev, my turning point in my relationship with you was when I heard your life story in \"Journey Home\" from your own divine lotus mouth in the audiobook. After undergoing so much turmoil, you finally arrived in India, and then its heart, Vrindavan. You said you felt like you were at home, and then you loved this place more than any other place in this world. Gurudev, by hearing you, I felt Vrindavan has become my home as well.\n Hearing the glories of Vrindavan and Nabadweep Dham and the pastimes of Sri Sri Radha Shyamsundar and Lord Chaitanya from you is my only lifesaving medicine. Your instruction to make chanting the topmost priority of my life has been the only cause I am still alive in Krsna Consciousness.\n \n Thank you for accepting me officially as your servant as well on December 27, 2024, along with 344 devotees from Pune.\n \n Gurudev, I am far from developing real, genuine love for the Divine Couple, but by your mercy, I can surely say serving Their lotus feet has become the only aspiration this servant carries in his heart, hoping to serve Them forever by assisting you and Srila Prabhupada.\n \n I will try my best to serve the mission of Srila Prabhupada in the mood of a servant of the servant till the end of this life and forever as well, just to please you.\n \n Your aspiring servant,\n Vilas Vardhan Das"

All the inner wounds and restlessness began to soften, and the pull of material attraction started to fade, slowly but surely. Your teachings, your example, and your love have been my medicine.\n\nThe first time I heard you speak, my heart whispered, “I want to take shelter of this pure soul forever.” When I applied for initiation, I knew I had no qualification at all, yet you accepted me with your oceanic mercy. It was not my worthiness, but your kindness that embraced me.\n\nI have no real love for Krishna, yet when I hear your katha, my heart becomes purified. I have no ability or qualification to deserve any mercy, but I do have immense love and gratitude for you, Guru Maharaj.\n\nYour life story, your sincerity, your boundless compassion, and your desperate longing to give Krishna’s love to every living being – they inspire me endlessly. You are my spiritual father, my eternal well-wisher, and my guiding light in this bewildering world.\n\nOn this sacred day of your 75th Vyas Puja, I bow my head and offer my heart at your lotus feet. I have nothing else to give, but please accept my heart, however small and impure it may be. Kindly hold my hand tightly, Gurudev, and never let me go.

I accept you as my eternal master, in this life and beyond.\n\nMay Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī always shower Her causeless mercy upon me, so that I may serve you in a way that pleases you.\n\nDespite all my impurities and shortcomings, you have lovingly accepted me. How can such a debt ever be repaid? Every day I pray to the Supreme Lord to bless you with perfect health so that we may continue to receive your divine association, hear Kṛṣṇa–kathā and Gaura–kathā from your holy lips, and develop pure love for the holy name.\n\nBy your mercy we will receive śuddha–nāma, and by the blessing of śuddha–nāma may we forever remain in your divine association, serving your mission with sincerity, humility, and love. May I never deviate from this sublime path, and may I always serve all living beings — moving and non–moving — with respect and devotion.\n\nMay I forever remain as the dust at the feet of your servant’s servant.\n\nYour most fallen yet eternally fortunate daughter,\nVilasini Rādhā Devī Dāsī"

I feel so fortunate to receive your blessings personally, and from that day onwards, I developed a strong desire to become your disciple and serve you. To my surprise, it became true.

I could even hear only a few of your classes live, sitting in the audience. Most of the guidance I received from you is through your recorded classes.

Maharaj, when you speak in classes, my experience is that you speak something which I would have never imagined or never learned anywhere else. You speak certain philosophical points which really give me the feeling of eyes actually opening to knowledge Cakshu Unmilitam. Many times, I have this realization that my birth was actually in the darkness of ignorance, and then you are opening my eyes and bringing me to light. If you and your disciples had not come into my life, I would have lived my life in that ignorance. Recently, I heard one of your classes on anartha, and you were speaking about envy. In that class, you mentioned how I am envious of Lord Krishna. You proved to me that although I call myself a devotee of Krishna, I actually have a big disease of being envious of Krishna because I want to enjoy, control, and own things.

In my life, Kṛṣṇa has sent you to inspire me to follow the path of Pure Devotional Service. In my small neophyte devotional life, I have been hearing your Vāṇī for the past 2.5 years, which keeps me going with full enthusiasm even in the midst of difficulties. Not only this insignificant soul, but you have inspired countless devotees all around the world through your personal example, Vaiṣṇava relationships, Divine Vāṇī filled with realization, wonderful Yatras, and nectarian kirtans.\n You inspire and engage devotees according to their abilities to bring out the best in themselves. You have inspired devotees to build GEV, doctors to build Bhaktivedanta Hospital, and householders to open Gopal’s Garden, and much more to engage each age group of people in Devotional Service at any point of life.\n Although you have faced so many hardships in your life, you are still always grateful Tat te anukampā... and fully surrendered to Śrila Prabhupāda, and you have always had a desire to please your Godbrothers/Godsisters. On Śrila Prabhupāda’s Disappearance Day in the last Kartik Yātrā at Mayapur, I remember you putting yourselves out of the center and putting your Godbrothers/Godsisters in the center and giving them the first chance to glorify Śrila Prabhupāda.\n I am extremely grateful and indebted to you for bestowing causeless mercy upon this fallen soul to come into my life. We cannot ever repay you, but we just try to please you and your representatives in whatever capacity we have. You always have expectations from all of us to do our sādhana intensely, to develop the mood of Servant of Servant of devotees, and to share this great message of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Śrila Prabhupāda in whatever capacity we have to other living entities. But I am extremely sorry to be unable to fulfill your instructions due to our insincerity. You only please grant us the strength to follow your instructions. May we make it as our life and soul, may we always remain under your divine shelter, and may we be able to develop a genuine Nāme Ruchi, earnest desire for serving devotees, and become a humble instrument in your representatives’ hands.\n Your Aspiring Servant of Servant,\n Vineet ISKCON VARANASI"

I still remember the first time I met Your Grace and received Your merciful darśana: at that moment I understood that I had finally found the Guru that I had been deeply seeking for so long. Tears of joy streamed down my face as I felt Your compassion embracing my soul.\n It was as if the boulders of daily worries melted instantly, and I experienced a pure joy that I had never felt before. This is because I felt that You could bring me back on the right path, the path of Bhakti.\n Thanks to You, I don\u0027t walk a lonely path in the desert, but I was officially welcomed this year on 10/02 in ISKCON, a great international spiritual family, in which I can find support and friendship from all the devotees. The moment of the recent first initiation will remain forever imprinted in my heart; I was for an instant in the spiritual world, exactly when my ears heard my spiritual name for the first time, and I felt alive, new, and my feet seemed to no longer touch the floor of the Temple.\n \n Your adventurous life is a powerful example for me and inspires me every time I encounter obstacles on my spiritual path: it reminds me that, with faith and determination, by the grace of Guru and Kṛṣṇa, I too will be able to overcome any adversity.\n You travel tirelessly to bring Krishna consciousness around the world, following the example of HDG Srila Prabhupada, our Ācārya Founder and Your teacher.\n Even if we are physically very far away, I feel You close every day through the priceless treasure of Your teachings that echo in my heart and continue to illuminate my path like a constant lighthouse, a spiritual compass capable of guiding every decision, big or small.\n \n I also want to express my deepest gratitude because You taught me to live in sobriety and truth, to cultivate relationships based on compassion and selfless love, to practice ahimsā.\n Through words and actions, You are an example of Mercy, Tolerance, Humility, Compassion and Purity.\n The virtues I mentioned guide my steps and remind me of the ideal of divine love to which I aspire.\n \n I try, in my small way, to develop at least a spark of Your luminous Bhakti in my life, so that I can serve You better in spreading Your teachings and, one day, becoming a disciple of whom You can be satisfied.\n There are not enough words to express my gratitude for all this.\n \n I promise You that I will continue to strive to apply Your teachings in my life and to share them with others, thus hoping to repay at least partially the immense debt of love I have towards You.\n \n On this sacred day dedicated to You, I humbly offer this letter to Your lotus feet, as a small sign of my love and devotion, praying that I can always remain under Your protection and brilliant spiritual guidance.\n \n \n Your grateful and devoted servant,\n Vinodā Māñjarī Devī Dāsī"

Also, your glance was so powerful; just by your one glance, I could feel how I am getting purified. Gurumaharaj, even though you mercifully accepted me as your disciple in a recent initiation ceremony, I felt in my heart receiving your shelter when I heard your lectures and how you saved me. Maharaj, I have no qualities which are expected. I am very much a struggling sadhaka and have committed so many offenses, but I would really beg you to forgive me and bless me. I want to follow your instructions and try to please you and at least try to develop the qualities like humility and respecting others which you emphasize the most. In one of your lectures, you have mentioned how there is no alternative for maturity and realization and how one has to be very sincere and strict in his sadhana. I would like to try to grow and follow this and also become more and more responsible in my spiritual as well as material duties. Thank you very much, Maharaj, for guiding at every step, and I have realized how you were guiding even before coming to K.C.\n Your insignificant humble servant,\n Vishwambhar Priya das."

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nI want to express my deep gratitude to you for everything you have done—not only for your disciples, but for the entire world. I am just an insignificant jiva, yet by your compassion you have given me purpose.\nI still remember the first time I met you in New Vrindavan nearly twenty years ago. All I recall is that you seemed to be glowing, and within my heart I felt an instant attraction. Every devotee knows this feeling upon meeting you. My attraction only grew as I began listening to your lectures. Again and again, at moments of doubt or confusion, the very lecture I heard would give me the answer I was seeking. You have taken on the burden of delivering me by giving me your shelter. Like a compassionate tree, you overlooked my faults and disqualifications and offered me the shade of your lotus feet.\nI have tried my best to follow the instructions you gave at the time of my initiation, though—as a conditioned soul—I have at times fallen short. I pray for the service that will help me assist you in your mission of serving His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.\nBy hearing your lectures, I have taken up the service of book distribution. Though I am not naturally a good speaker or salesperson—and not even a very qualified disciple—I have found great meaning in this service. It has inspired me to read Srila Prabhupada’s books more deeply so that I may answer questions and better share his teachings. My love for reading Srila Prabhupada’s books has grown because of your guidance.\nAlthough we have met only a few times, and even then from some distance, I always feel your presence through your instructions and your lectures. I pray that, birth after birth, I may be blessed with the opportunity to assist you in your service as the servant of the servant of the servant.\nBy your causeless mercy, I was fortunate to attend the last two Yatras. I cannot imagine the immense planning and labor that goes into arranging them so that thousands of devotees may gather together. Your humble and prayerful mood is the ideal all your disciples aspire to follow. In the footsteps of Srila Prabhupada, you have given everything for the upliftment of the world. Nothing we do can ever repay the causeless mercy you show to fallen souls like myself.\nEven though I am full of faults and anarthas, you have given me shelter. In the prayerful mood of Lord Brahma, I beg that you kindly empower all of your disciples for service, protect us from pride, and keep us sheltered from deviation from the path of devotional service. Guru Maharaj, I owe everything to you. I pray that I may become a small, menial instrument in your service to Srila Prabhupada.\nYour unworthy servant,\nVisvanath das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n \n Please accept my humble obeisances.\n \n On this auspicious occasion of your 75th appearance, I would like to recall the mercy which you have bestowed upon this insignificant soul. What I was before and what I am now. Earlier, I was living a life without any purpose or goal, but you came into my life and gave me a purpose to live for and showed me the ultimate goal. Had you not come into my life, I was attracted by material beauty, but you showed me the true beauty of Radha Krishna. Had you not come into my life, I was attracted to my material home and realities, but you showed me my true home, Sri Vrindavan Dham, and my family of devotees. A deep thought came to mind: Was I qualified to receive all these matchless gifts? Certainly not, but you made my qualification and gave these gifts.\n \n Dear Maharaj, the yatras which you take are so nectarean that during that period, we get a glimpse of the spiritual world, and this is only possible because of your hours and hours of prayers before Sri Sri Radha Gopinath.\n \n Maharaj, in every lecture, your focus is on \"trinadapi sunichena______\" and gratefulness, and Maharaj, we can see that you are an emblem of these qualities. Maharaj, one statement of yours that stuck with me is, \"If you want to love God, then you should learn to forgive.\" And then I realized, Maharaj, why so much stress on gratitude, because a grateful heart is a humble heart, and only a humble heart can forgive.\n \n Maharaj, while I was a student studying material subjects, we learned about so many revolutions created by sociologists for the betterment of society. In the same way, Maharaj, you also created a revolution in the misdirected lives of people by guiding them towards spirituality and made them best in the eyes of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, which is the topmost achievement. So, in that sense, Maharaj, you are the best revolutionist.\n \n Maharaj, your life is Srimad Bhagavad personified, and by your nectarean classes, you imbibe in us those teachings of Bhagvatam so sweetly, and that is true strength to practice devotional service. Tukaram Maharaj, in one of his Abhangas, says:\n \n बोले तैसा चाले । त्याची वंदीन पाउले\n \n \"He who \u0027walks his talk\u0027 — I bow down to his feet.\"\n \n Maharaj, as you once said, \"I want to take all my disciples back home, back to Godhead.\" And Maharaj, you are here to give us Krishna, and practically, it is seen by your lectures and kirtans, you want everyone to absorb themselves in the spirit of Krishna consciousness. May one day I realize that you want me to be with Radha Krishna in this lifetime.\n \n Maharaj, lastly, what more can I say? What I never thought about, I have got. You didn\u0027t give me what I liked, but you gave me what I need. May your 75th appearance day remind me of these matchless gifts which I have received. May I remain grateful forever, imbibe the principles of \"Trinadapi sunichena______,\" and share these gifts with others. And may I remain deeply attached to you.\n \n \"Vrindavan is near to you,\n Sri Sri Radha Gopinath is dear to you,\n and misconceptions of life are cleared by you.\"\n \n Thank you very much for everything.\n \n Your Eternal Servant,\n Vraj Madhav Das"

it is solely his mercy.\nFrom him I understood who Krishna truly is,\nI learned the teachings of the Gita and Bhagavatam,\nand I understood the science of how to practice devotion to the Supreme Lord.\nIn life, the mercy of the Guru is extremely important because only through him can we reach the Supreme Lord.\nAt the lotus feet of such a pure representative of God, I offer my countless obeisances.\nYour servant,\nVraj Rasika Devi Dasi\nNashik\"\"\""

The instructions that come to my mind today are as follows:\n \n Live without pretending. This instruction displays your quality of honesty. You honestly admit that you can’t do management even though you are very good at it. You consider yourself a grass-root person. On this point, I remember a lecture where Srila Prabhupad once said honestly that he wasn’t sure whether taking sannyas was a wrong decision. This is because, in the initial years, he faced a lot of challenges. But Prabhupad said that he knew that Krsna would look after him.\n \n Hear without defending. This instruction displays your quality of humility. Once, after your Bhagwatam class, someone challenged your explanation. You quietly listened to his challenge and accepted it, even though your explanation was in line with Prabhupad’s explanation. When asked about your behavior, you said that you didn’t want to challenge your senior.\n \n Speak without offending. This instruction displays your quality of sensitivity. You are very careful about the words that you choose. Once, a few devotees complained to you about a mataji’s frivolous behavior. You immediately corrected the word to be being ‘over-friendly’. In another instance, one brahmachari was being a hypocrite with his behavior. Even though you knew about this, you changed the description to being ‘unqualified for Brahmacharya’. You didn’t want to use heavy words like ‘frivolous’ and ‘hypocrite’ because you wanted to send the message without offending.\n \n Love without expecting. This instruction displays your quality of compassion. HG Gurudas prabhu once said that you are the most uncompromising, open-minded person he has ever met. In one instance, you spent 3 full days talking to your god-brothers, who had left ISKCON. But you wanted to give them compassion and still feel connected to Prabhupad and Krsna. I have also personally experienced your compassion through the behavior of your senior disciples like HG Shubha Vilas Prabhu, HG Muralidhar Prabhu, and HG Radha Rani Mataji, with me and my family.\n \n I lack these qualities. But, going ahead, I will strive sincerely to follow these instructions. As every day passes, I genuinely feel unqualified to have received your mercy. However, I always pray to the Lord to give me intelligence such that my actions, words, and behavior give justice to the compassion that you showered, by accepting me as your disciple.\n \n I sincerely request you to keep me under the cool shade of your mercy and compassion because without your blessings, I have no identity. As Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur says:\n \n Yogyata-vicare, kichu nahi pai,\n Tomara karuna—sara\n Karuna na hoile, kandiya kandiya,\n Prana na rakhibo ara\n \n Your eternal servant,\n \n Vraja Bhāva Dās"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my humble obeisances.\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for picking me up from the horrible depths of a life of sense gratification, and giving me shelter at Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Mandir. The community is a surreal oasis, a spiritual world, where sincere devotees who love you assist you in your service to Their Lordships, Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, Srila Prabhupada, and their devotees. And these devotees truly carry your compassion in their hearts. My profuse thanks to you for giving me shelter of Vaishnavas who perfectly imbibe your mood and mission; your love and loyalty to Srila Prabhupada; and your devotion and dedication to the sacred Brahma Madhva Gaudiya Parampara.\n Today, I would like to particularly thank you for the series of lectures you gave last year during the initiation festivals that we had in Mumbai, Nasik, Kolhapur, and Belgaum. I heard them as sincerely and attentively as possible and drew many important lessons for my own spiritual life. I would like to thank you for the same. The most important lesson I learned from your heartfelt instructions during these ceremonies, which I would like to particularly meditate on today on your 75th Vyasa Puja, is as follows:\n “All attractions of this world not only pale in comparison to the attractiveness of Krishna, but also ultimately come from an insignificant portion of Krishna’s splendor. Through occasions like initiation ceremonies, Krishna is beckoning us to come to Him and He has mercifully sent the parampara to help us come to Him.”\n When I heard this from you, I knew instantly that you were sent by Krishna, for you were on your way to the Himalayas, but inconceivably you got off the train at a station and then realized it was Mathura Junction, and that day happened to be Krishna’s appearance day. This was ordained by Krishna Himself—that you visit His birthplace on His birthday. Even at Patna, when you were hearing Ram katha from Ramsevak Swami, his disciple was translating the Hindi talk in English for you, but he only kept narrating the Damodar lila to you daily. Puzzled, you asked him why he repeated the same story daily while you could hear words like Rama, Sita, Hanuman etc. in the talks of Ramsevak Swami. The disciple humbly said that his guru had told him that Lord Rama had appeared to him in a dream and told him that you are a devotee of Krishna and you should hear Krishna katha. Unfortunately, the disciple didn’t know any other pastime other than Damodar Lila, so he daily spoke the same story to you while Ramsevak Swami was speaking Ramayana daily. This was another confirmation that you are especially dear to Krishna.\n Once, at Kumbh Mela, in January 2000, I saw a sophisticated CEO challenge you at the preaching tent. He repeatedly asked you why you left Judaism to embrace Hinduism when all religions essentially teach the same thing. You offered a diplomatic answer at first, saying how love of God is the message of all faiths; and perfection can be attained by any religious system. Instead of placating him, this agitated him more and he persisted with his challenge. Finally, when you realized that his questioning was pointed and specific, and there was no way you could avoid answering the truth, you humbly bowed your head and then softly, yet confidently, looking straight into his eyes, said, “I accepted Krishna consciousness because Krishna attracted my heart like nobody and nothing else.”\n All these incidents confirm that you are an eternal associate of Krishna, and sent by Krishna to save us from material life, and take us back to Him.\n In one of the mid-1990s lectures you gave to the fledgling congregation at Nigdi, you spoke the Brahmana wives pastime where the simple women ran, overcoming all obstacles and breaking all social barriers, to offer all the foodstuffs to Krishna and Balarama. At one point in the class, you paused and slowly said that just like Krishna sent the boys to the brahmanas, and then to their wives to ask for food, similarly, you have been sent by Krishna and Srila Prabhupada to ask them to offer their ‘food’ life to Krishna. You said with loving compassion that you are sincerely going to offer them to Srila Prabhupada and Krishna. Then, you requested all of us to not be like the proud and reluctant brahmanas but the simple and surrendered wives of the brahmanas.\n On this most auspicious occasion of your appearance day, I wish to repeatedly remember how you are most dear to Krishna and how you have been mercifully sent by Krishna to ask us to offer our lives to Krishna.\n Today, I wish to offer all that I have to you, for pleasing you, for I know you are faithfully serving Srila Prabhupada and Krishna’s orders of delivering the conditioned souls, who are rotting in this bizarre material world.\n Dear Guru Maharaj, please take pity on me and pick me up from the abyss of material life and accept my meager offerings made in a feeble voice. Please accept me and give me a chance to redeem myself and come back to Krishna in this one lifetime.\n Thank you again\n Aspiring to be the servant of your servants\n Vraja Bihari Dasa"

        "Your Offering ":  "Dear Śrī Gurudeva,\n I offer my respectful obeisances at your lotus feet.\n You are dear to my heart, for you have stirred within me the inspiration to yearn for Śrī Kṛṣṇa. You are dear to my heart, for you have opened your life and the secrets of your heart for the world to see, allowing me, through your Journey Home, to understand what a true Vaiṣṇava feels and endures in his journey toward attaining bhakti.\n “Just like merciful persons, the clouds gave their lives for the pleasure of this world.” – Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 10.20.6.\n Your love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa pierces my heart again and again: when the mahā-mantra, out of its own sweet will, arose from the depths of the Gaṅgā to you; when the blue boy playing a flute appeared from a stack of prints in New Delhi; when you cried out, “Kṛṣṇa! His name is Kṛṣṇa!” upon seeing His name for the first time at Cross Maidan in Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Kṛṣṇa Book; when you trembled in gratitude as Prabhupāda’s unspoken words “Kṛṣṇa is waiting for you” entered your heart; when you listened to the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa stealing butter and being caught by Mother Yaśodā from Nārāyaṇa Prasād; when Lord Rāma appeared to Rāma Sevaka Swami and instructed him, “This young boy is a devotee of Kṛṣṇa; speak to him only about the glories of Kṛṣṇa”; when you arrived in Mathurā on Janmāṣṭamī day, only to be lovingly tricked by Kṛṣṇa to keep you in Vṛndāvana; when you witnessed the spontaneous love of Kṛṣṇadāsa Bābājī, who chanted Kṛṣṇa’s names day and night; when you heard of Kṛṣṇa calling out to the gopīs with the sweet songs of His flute, and how they abandoned everything to run toward Him on that rāsa-pūrṇimā night; when you fixed your heart upon the enchanting sight of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa dancing beneath the moonlit sky as described by Bon Mahārāja; when you received the most confidential secrets of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s love from Viśākhā Śaraṇa Bābā; when you closed your eyes in Rādhā’s forest Barsānā and felt the love of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa showering upon you; and when you received the invisible, mystical blessings of Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī at his samādhi.\n “My dear friend, if you are indeed attached to your worldly friends, do not look at the smiling face of Govinda as He stands on the bank of the Yamunā at Keśīghāṭa.” – Caitanya-caritāmṛta, ādi-līlā, 5.224\n Mahārāja, you have taught me countless lessons throughout your life.\n From your dealings with sādhus of various sampradāyas, such as Bon Mahārāja, Kṛṣṇadāsa Bābājī, Ramesh Bābā, Ghanasyām, and much more, you have taught me the principle of seeing the hearts of devotees beyond sectarian boundaries, never becoming crippled by the small-mindedness of building walls of division. Even harboring a trace of hatred toward a Vaiṣṇava in the mind is detrimental to one’s own bhakti. May I etch this truth deep within my heart and never forget it.\n “If by chance the offense of hatred, malice or criticism of a Vaiṣṇava occurs, the person should be repentant, recognizing his own low nature in having committed the offense, and should nullify the offense by lamenting, resolving to come before the Vaiṣṇava, fall at his feet, and satisfy him by offering his obeisances, praises and respects.” – Mādhurya-kādambiṇī, third shower.\n When you once felt remorse for imitating a camera click to help a friend, realizing later that it hurt a Vaiṣṇava’s heart, you taught me the gravity of never causing pain to any devotee, whether in the name of preaching, philosophical argument, missionary activity, or trying to shove my own understanding of Kṛṣṇa consciousness into someone’s throat to choke him.\n “Nor should one think that the offense of sādhu-nindā operates only in relation to a Vaiṣṇava who is fully and perfectly endowed with all the qualities mentioned in scripture, such as tolerance, mercy and kindness to all living entities. Such a person attempts to minimize his own offense by pointing out some defect in the Vaiṣṇava.” – Mādhurya-kādambiṇī, third shower.\n When you resisted pressures from disciples of various gurus who sought to impose their own dogmas upon you, you taught me “resistance”, and taught me to follow one’s own inner calling, of fanning the spark of love for Kṛṣṇa that arises uniquely in each heart.\n “So different devotees have different inclinations to offer his service to different features of God.” – Śrīla Prabhupāda, December 15th 1966, New York\n Through your resolve to serve within ISKCON and your endeavors to associate harmoniously with your godbrothers despite differences, you taught me that the real unity of devotees lies not in uniformity but in cooperation, serving Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa according to one’s own calling under the guidance of Śrī Guru, in the movement of Śrīla Prabhupāda.\n “Advanced devotees can understand and appreciate the different varieties of devotional service reciprocated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” – Caitanya-caritāmṛta, madhya-līlā, 23.99.\n When you changed the spirit of book distribution, urging that we strive to distribute more and yet pray to “come last”, you taught me a very important principle to focus on humility and the genuine fruits of bhakti in the form of one’s own attraction to Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, rather than nourishing the ego by chasing the honour from others by so-called “spiritual” achievements.\n “Humility means the freedom from the anxiety of having the satisfaction of being honoured by others.” – Śrī Guru\n Through your life, you have shown that both bhajanānandīs and goṣṭhyānandīs are exalted in their own ways, and that you yourself embody both aspects in your personality. This teaches me the greatness of our paramparā, where some ācāryas are immersed in deep internal bhajana, while others are dedicated to preaching and outreach—each perfectly serving Śrī Kṛṣṇa according to their nature.\n “The best devotional service for a devotee is that by which he attains complete satisfaction and joy. He should do it with full faith, for it will bring the desired result since it is done with affection. The saintly authorities consider that service to be the essence of a devotee’s goal for it will manifest prema.” – Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta 2.3.152\n As the years carry us further from the time of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s earthly presence, we risk drifting from the full, multifaceted, all-accommodating vision of his personality. Therefore, I pray at your lotus feet: may I develop ever-deepening love and understanding of Śrīla Prabhupāda; may gratitude and affection for the Vaiṣṇavas ever increase within me; may I cultivate a thirst for śāstric study and, if you so desire, share that understanding with others; may I awaken intense greed for the divine service of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in the mood of Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī. And may I realize the true meaning of the name you have so mercifully bestowed upon me.\n “Taking straw in my teeth, I pray again and again: May I become a piece of dust at the lotus feet of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, birth after birth.” – Mukta-carita\n I pray to Śrī Kṛṣṇa for your long, healthy life, Gurudeva, so that you may continue to inspire millions of souls like my fallen self.\n Your servant,\n Vraja Jīvana Dāsa"

        "Your Offering ":  "Respected Dear Gurudev,\n Please accept my dandavats pranams.\n \n One of the rare qualities that I appreciate in you is your ability to slow down. This ability stems from the depth of calmness that you have in your heart and consciousness, which is displayed through your mind, words, and actions. And due to this, you are also present, mindful, and thoughtful in everything you do, every conversation you strike, every thing you see, feel, and touch.\n And when I think why and how you can be like that, the only thing that comes to my mind is that you are with Lord Krishna always. You are a lover of Krishna and therefore you never leave Him. And because you never ever leave Him, you naturally get that quality of gravity and depth, which makes your every move, word, and act full of grace.\n \n In a world where we are all constantly being coerced to be fast, this quality of slowing down is really needed to be \u0027conscious\u0027 and then finally be \u0027Krishna conscious\u0027.\n \n Real gratitude is shown by one\u0027s actions. Although in that sense, I don\u0027t have an iota of gratitude, but today I want to take this opportunity to express the same in my empty words.\n \n You are our friend, father, guide, and well-wisher. Like a flowing river that is ever available to relieve the traveler\u0027s fatigue and thirst, you have been always present for all of us. The only limitation is our container and the resistance in approaching you.\n \n I am unlimitedly grateful for the beautiful god family you have given us. There is so much debt that my family has from all the service we have received. When my mother, HG Laadli Radha Mataji, was diagnosed with cancer, the entire GeV community so nicely accommodated her and nourished both of my parents. Srinandanandan Prabhu, Gauranga Prabhu, Vasudev Prabhu, Dr. Sridhar, and so many others took such nice care. They did all the things that I was supposed to do. But, as unfortunate as I am, I missed that opportunity to serve. Now my father is a resident of GeV and has so many devotee friends. And he is very happy staying in GeV.\n \n We hope someday we all would be able to do some service to GeV that may make you happy.\n \n This year of 2025, three of the most important father figures in my life turned 75. You, Gurudev, my father HG Shyam Behari Prabhu, and India\u0027s Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. It is my sincere and earnest desire to serve you, dear Maharaj, in a way that all the other father figures are satisfied.\n \n I am actually not a good person, Maharaj. I don\u0027t have emotional bonding with anyone. Thus, I can be very dry in relationships. But you, Maharaj, are a king in relationships. I am your subject, although unwilling. I beg you to reward me with a fraction of your consciousness so I can have meaningful relationships. What else is Vrindavan about? It is all about loving relationships, as you have taught.\n \n Thank you very much, Maharaj, for everything. I beg Lord Krishna to remove all duplicity that I have so that I mean whatever I speak and I do whatever I say.\n An unsurrendered soul and aspiring to be a servant of your servants,\n Vraja Kishore das"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishnas Respected Gurumaharaj,\n \n Please accept my respectful obeisances\n All Glories to Sri Sri Guru and Gauranga\n All Glories to Srila Prabhupada\n My heartfelt prayers for Your good health and long life.\n \n Today I would like to express my deepest gratitude for one of the qualities which is very rare and is the only hope for a disciple. I would like to describe the protection aspect of Guru.\n \n Guru-tattva — The Principle of the Spiritual Master\n Guru-tattva means understanding the truth or principle of the spiritual master. The Guru is not an ordinary person; he represents Krishna’s mercy in the most tangible way.\n \n Bhagavad Gītā 4.34\n tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā\n upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ\n \n “Approach a spiritual master, inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.”\n \n Srila Prabhupāda’s purport:\n The Guru is tattva-darśī — one who has seen the truth. He connects the disciple to Krishna through śabda-brahma, the sound vibration of transcendental knowledge.\n Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 11.17.27\n ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit\n na martya-buddhyāsūyeta sarva-deva-mayo guruḥ\n “One should know the ācārya spiritual master to be My very self and never disrespect him in any way. The spiritual master should never be considered an ordinary man, for he is the sum total of all the demigods.”\n Explanation:\n Here, Krishna declares that the Guru is His representative, carrying His potency. Through the Guru, Krishna manifests His mercy —\n Kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana CC Madhya 8.128.\n \n Gurumaharaj would say,\n “Just as a child holds the hand of the father to cross a busy street, the disciple holds the hand of the Guru through faith and service. That hand is strong because it is Krishna’s own hand reaching out to us.”\n \n A true spiritual master doesn’t make us depend on him — he teaches us to depend on Krishna.\n Through His example, Gurumaharaj awakens our faith that Krishna is our eternal protector.\n How the Guru Protects His Disciples\n The Guru’s protection is spiritual, not merely physical. It is the protection of consciousness — protecting the disciple from māyā, illusion, and helping him stay fixed in bhakti and remembrance of Krishna.\n \n Let’s look at how this protection operates:\n \n a Protection through Instruction — Jñāna-rakṣaṇa\n The Guru gives divya-jñāna, transcendental knowledge, which destroys ignorance.\n Just as a lamp protects one from darkness, knowledge from the Guru protects one from illusion.\n \n Srimad Bhāgavatam 11.22.10\n jñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ yadā guhyatamaṁ mama\n tad vedituṁ bhavān arhati śraddhāvān anasūyakaḥ\n By giving jñāna and vijñāna, the Guru protects the disciple’s buddhi from being stolen by māyā.\n \n Gurumaharaj’s example:\n He protects his disciples by constantly reminding them of Krishna-centered consciousness, through scriptural classes, personal instructions, and his own life of humility and service. His teachings always center around “Remember Krishna, serve others, and stay under the shelter of the holy name.”\n That remembrance itself is protection.\n \n Gurumaharaj often explains that the Guru protects us by reminding us of who we really are.\n “The world tries to make us forget.\n Maya whispers, ‘You are the controller, you are the enjoyer.’\n But the Guru whispers Krishna’s name into our heart.”\n This whisper of divine remembrance — this śabda-brahma — is the Guru’s shield of protection. It’s not the kind of protection that removes every storm; it’s the kind that gives us shelter within the storm.\n \n He says,\n “When the storm comes, don’t pray for the storm to stop — pray for the strength to hold on to Krishna’s lotus feet.”\n The Guru gives us that strength.\n \n b Protection through Prayer — Kṛpā-rakṣaṇa\n A pure devotee prays for his disciples constantly.\n The Guru’s heart is linked to Krishna’s heart; he begs Krishna to protect those who have taken shelter of him.\n \n Srimad Bhāgavatam 10.2.31\n ye \u0027nye \u0027ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ ... patanty adho \u0027nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ\n Even a learned person can fall down without shelter of the Lord’s lotus feet.\n The Guru ensures the disciple always remains under those feet through his prayers and mercy.\n \n Gurumaharaj’s Example:\n He often says, “I pray for you all every day.”\n This prayer is not sentiment — it’s spiritual intercession. Just as a father prays for his children, the Guru holds the disciple in his heart and connects them to Krishna through his compassion.\n \n Gurumaharaj sometimes describes how the Guru feels toward his disciples:\n “The Guru prays for his disciples even when they forget to pray for themselves.\n He stands before Krishna like a mother before a doctor — begging, ‘Please save my child.’”\n \n This is *kṛpā-rakṣaṇa* — protection through compassion.\n The Guru may be far away physically, but his prayers travel faster than thought.\n A sincere disciple is never alone.\n \n Srimad Bhāgavatam 11.17.27 says:\n ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit...\n “Know the ācārya to be My very self.”\n \n Gurumaharaj explains,\n “It means Krishna is personally guiding us through the Guru’s words, through his example, and sometimes through his silence.”\n \n c Protection through Example — Ācāra-rakṣaṇa\n The ācārya protects by living the teachings.\n Seeing the Guru’s example strengthens the disciple’s faith and determination.\n \n Bhagavad Gītā 3.21\n yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ\n “Whatever great men do, common men follow.”\n \n Gurumaharaj’s Example:\n His humility, forgiveness, simplicity, and deep compassion inspire devotees to face challenges without losing faith. His life itself becomes a shield — reminding disciples that bhakti is not theoretical; it’s lived sincerity.\n \n In Gurumaharaj’s life, we see that his teaching and living are one.\n He sleeps little, eats simply, travels tirelessly — just to help souls reconnect to Krishna.\n \n Once he said:\n “If my life can help even one person remember Krishna, then my life is successful.”\n That example is protection — because it shows us what bhakti looks like when it is lived with love.\n By seeing how the Guru faces pain with gratitude, we learn how to face our own challenges with faith.\n By seeing how he forgives, we learn what forgiveness means.\n By seeing how he serves, we learn what real happiness is.\n \n This is ācāra-rakṣaṇa — protection through example.\n \n d Protection through Disciplic Connection — Paramparā-rakṣaṇa\n The Guru gives protection by connecting the disciple to the paramparā — to Krishna’s unbroken current of mercy.\n When we are connected to this current, māyā cannot touch us.\n \n Bhagavad Gītā 4.2\n evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ\n The chain of disciplic succession protects the purity of knowledge and the consciousness of those within it.\n \n Srila Prabhupada says:\n “A disciple connected to the bona fide Guru is connected directly to Krishna.”\n Thus, following Guru’s instructions keeps one under Krishna’s direct protection.\n The Guru’s real protection is not just emotional shelter — it’s spiritual connection.\n \n In Bhagavad Gītā 18.66, Krishna promises:\n sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja\n ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ\n \n Gurumaharaj explains,\n “The Guru’s greatest gift is to bring us to that verse — to help us take shelter of Krishna without fear. When we surrender to Krishna through the Guru’s instructions, Krishna personally takes the responsibility to protect us.”\n So, when a disciple sincerely follows the Guru’s instructions, Krishna Himself guards that devotee’s heart.\n \n That is the perfection of Guru’s protection.\n \n e Protection through Chastisement — Śāsana-rakṣaṇa\n Sometimes, the Guru protects by correcting or chastising the disciple — not out of anger, but mercy.\n \n Bhāgavatam 4.8.34\n guruḥ sākṣāt hariḥ ity uktaḥ ... kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya\n The Guru is as good as God, but his chastisement or correction is a form of divine love.\n If the disciple accepts such correction, he becomes purified and protected from downfall.\n \n Gurumaharaj once said,\n “When a Guru points out our faults, it is not to make us feel small — it is to help us become who we truly are: servants of Krishna.”\n Like a doctor, he identifies the disease of ego and prescribes the medicine of humility.\n That correction, though uncomfortable, is an act of deep protection.\n Because without it, we might wander away from the path of bhakti.\n \n f The Guru Protects through the Family of Devotees\n Gurumaharaj often emphasizes that the Guru’s protection also manifests through the devotee community.\n “We protect one another when we live in the spirit of service.\n Krishna’s love flows most beautifully through relationships.”\n So when disciples cooperate, forgive, and care for each other, they are living under the Guru’s protection.\n \n He says,\n “When you water the root of the tree, every leaf and branch is nourished.\n When you serve the mission of your Guru, you are nourished spiritually.”\n \n 3. The Heart of the Guru — Gurumaharaj’s Mood\n Gurumaharaj embodies the protective compassion of the Guru in several ways:\n He nurtures the hearts of disciples with affection and patience.\n He teaches balance — to be strong in sādhana but gentle with others.\n He inspires service — by teaching that serving devotees and humanity is real protection of the soul.\n He creates community — spiritual family as an extension of his protection.\n \n He often quotes:\n “When we take shelter of Krishna and the devotees, Krishna protects us more than a mother protects her child in the womb.”\n \n Essence\n The Guru-tattva is the manifestation of Krishna’s heart of mercy.\n Through his words, actions, prayers, and presence, the Guru protects the disciple’s faith, bhakti, and connection with Krishna.\n \n As Srila Prabhupada said:\n “The spiritual master is the external manifestation of the Supersoul, and he protects the disciple from falling again into the ocean of birth and death.”\n \n In Gurumaharaj’s words:\n “A real Guru doesn’t claim to be God — he connects you to God.\n He doesn’t make you dependent on him — he teaches you to depend on Krishna.\n And he doesn’t remove the storms — he teaches you how to dance in the rain of Krishna’s mercy.”\n \n So I am very grateful to Gurumaharaj for giving this protection to us. As a disciple, I cannot repay the debt of Gurumaharaj, but would like to pray that if He feels happy, He can engage me in some service so that I can continue to serve Him.\n }}\n Your eternal servant,\n Vraja krishna das"

Those few days are unforgettable for me. On the first day, you had darshan of Lord Rama, followed by darshan of Sita Cave. Heavy rain began. Despite this heavy rain, you came to the banks for the Godavari Aarti. Despite the cold weather, you gave initiation the next day. On Dussehra, you performed Godavari Puja and Aarti, followed by the burning of Ravana. After all this, you sat on the banks and prayed for all the devotees. Despite such a large three-day program, you called a small meeting for close devotees at the Nashik Congregation on the fourth morning. In that meeting, you recalled all the old memories, from the beginning of the Nashik ISKCON campaign. There was an exchange of words amongst devotees. The experience of that meeting was unique. The devotees of Nashik ISKCON sponsored the \u0027Ter Kadam GEV Project\u0027 at that meeting.\n\nMaharaj, I am always excited for the Kartik Yatra because of your beautiful discourses, captivating kirtans, and the gathering of thousands of devotees. During this year\u0027s Govardhan Yatra, you provided me with a sweet experience of katha and kirtan for hours which made me even more excited. After the morning chanting, you would come to oversee the kitchen management. You would keep an eye on how everyone, from young children to the elderly,were being served.\n\nWhen the offerings for the Govardhan Puja were being prepared, you came and showered your blessings on all the devotees, and I still remember your smile and laughter.\n\nMaharaj, you are so compassionate that you accepted a disciple like me. Thank you very much, Maharaj, and I offer my heartfelt obeisances at your feet.\n\nYour disciple,\n\nKarpur Manjiri Devi Dasi\""

        "Your Offering ":  "November 15 2025, Sri Mayapur Dhama\n \n Dearest Gurudeva, Hare Krishna\n Please accept my most humble\u003cbos\u003e\n All glories to Srila Prabhupada\n karuṇā-sindhu, kṛpā-sindhu…”\n “You are the ocean of mercy, the ocean of compassion…”\n \n Gurudeva, how can I properly put into words what my heart experiences when I think of your mercy.\n Your mercy simply knows no end. Every time I think of you, it’s as if the sun rises in my heart and a beautiful meadow of yellow flowers appears with you standing in the centre, illuminating my entire being. Never could I have expected to receive such incredible mercy, such an incredible spiritual master in my little life, a teacher who embodies Srila Prabhupada’s mood and teachings so expertly, naturally and joyfully; it is just absolutely beyond what I could have ever wished for!\n Your presence in my heart is such a powerful light that shines all over my internal world, dissipating all darkness. You are truly the sun of my heart, the sunshine of my life.\n Your darshan that I treasure with all my heart gives me so much hope, so much joy.\n I truly don’t know how to convey the joy I feel when I see you. My heart sings, rings, jumps and dances all over like a monkey gone mad. I just try to stay calm from the outside, but the joy I feel, it’s beyond me.\n \n I am so limited, so fragile at times, so vulnerable and have such a long way to go. But when I am with you or think of you, I feel strong! I feel that by your mercy, YES, it’s possible! This life may not be a life of comfort, but it definitely is the life meant to give our hearts back to Krsna and just surrender unto Him!\n How easy He made it for us, this life, even if it’s so hard at times due to deep-seated anarthas and countless samskaras. But when I feel I cannot handle anymore punches of maya, I simply think of you and your glance. You see straight into my soul, beyond all my layers of conditioning, all of my limitations, and look straight into my heart. It is such a mercy that I can’t even handle it sometimes, spending days just in awe of your mercy and the joy you exude to all those fortunate souls that receive your darshan. I constantly feel the desire to please and allow me to serve you.\n \n Gurudeva, thank you times a billion for believing in me, for allowing me to be your disciple, for trusting me and giving me such incredible shelter that I just don’t even know how it is possible that I may receive such pure care and encouragement. It touches me deeply; it humbles me to my core. And all I can think of is how much I want to make you happy by serving all of God’s children. Then so much love pours into my heart that it just floods over.\n \n You have given me a new life, healed my heart to such a degree that now I just want to give back for the rest of my life, all that I have, all that Krsna allowed me and entrusted to me. It is not possible to give what I have received, but I will try nevertheless.\n When I see you laugh, when I close my eyes and see you sit in lotus position, the way you share your incredible pastimes, your sound effects, your eyes when they lit up in the middle of a story, and the countless words of wisdom that flood into the room, filling my being with such purity, such taste, cleansing my heart and mind from useless worries that were occupying my being before I entered the room, I come home inside.\n You are truly the miracle of my life.\n \n Someone was saying that you are so merciful, that you actually embody the quality krpalu.\n They could not be more true. When you appear in public, the eyes of the people looking at you, receiving your darshan, say a thousand words. I love going through the photos and videos of seeing how people look at you, their expression, their eyes… as in their eyes you can actually see your mercy. Their expression is that of receiving mercy. The light within them ignited, instantly forgetting all their worries, simply by being touched by your mercy. Your presence is the embodiment of mercy and grace.\n \n Simply by your glance, you bring out the absolute best in people, often without them even realising it. It is so profoundly beautiful.\n I pray with my entire being that I may serve you and God’s children in such a way that makes you, Srila Prabhupada, and Gauranga truly pleased. There is nothing more joyful, more beautiful, more fulfilling, more inspiring than seeing you happy and serving you.\n Even if I can’t see you sometimes for years, I feel so seen and cared for, so sheltered by your mercy, and it’s so deeply humbling….\n From the very first time I met you, under that tree in rainy Cologne, each word you said went straight into my heart and remained there, becoming unforgettable. How, with just a few words, you can completely change someone’s life. It’s a miracle.\n And how blessed I am to be in the presence of such a miracle. How blessed I feel to be your disciple. There are no adequate words to truly express how deeply, incredibly, utterly blessed, humbled, and so immensely grateful I am for all that you are and do.\n Whatever you would like from me, please know nothing gives me greater joy than to serve and please you.\n \n With all of my being, with my entire heart and soul, thank you so very much Gurudeva.\n Thank you for giving me a chance in this life, the chance to truly deepen my relationship with Radha-Krishna, the chance to truly come back to Them one day, if They wish.\n Thank you for helping me serve Srila Prabhupada better. Thank you for giving me the strength, compassion, and courage to pick myself up every time I am pushed back into the darkness.\n \n Every word you ever spoke to me is with me, and it keeps me going with full faith and so much enthusiasm in my heart. Thank you for the constant realisation of how incredibly, utterly fortunate I am. Thank you for teaching me how to serve others. Thank you for teaching me how to heal my entire life. Because you are my life.\n So now my life is completely perfect.\n \n Forever your servant\n Vraja Sundari Devi Dasi"

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna\n Dearest Guru Maharaj,\n Please accept my respectful obeisances.\nOn this auspicious day of your Vyas Puja, I wish to take a solemn vow to become a better devotee. Through your exemplary life and profound instructions, I have come to understand so many divine qualities that a sincere sadhaka should aspire to cultivate. These qualities not only please You, Srila Prabhupada, our Acharyas, and Krishna, but they also open the doors to the infinite grace and mercy that the Guru Parampara is constantly showering on us. Yet, due to my hard-heartedness and false ego, I often fail to taste or even desire that mercy.\n \n Guru Maharaj, you repeatedly emphasize the importance of humility. I must strive to be humble like a blade of grass—simple words, yet so challenging to live by. True humility is not feeling low or discouraged; it is the awakened realization of the Supreme Lord’s greatness and the exalted position of His devotees and my insignificance. Genuine humility will free me from envy and pride, allowing my heart to rejoice in and appreciate the wonderful qualities of devotees around me.\n \n Another quality I deeply desire to cultivate is gratitude. You teach us that a grateful heart is like fertile soil in which the creeper of bhakti can grow strong and flourish. Real gratitude means sincere reciprocation—offering back everything I have received. Gratitude to the spiritual master is not limited to a yearly “thank you”; it means, “You have given me everything, and if I am truly grateful, I want to offer my entire life in return.” Guru Maharaj, I want to do whatever will please you. I want to dedicate every moment of my life to assisting you in serving Srila Prabhupada’s mission.\n \n You also teach that sincere service attitude is essential for a sadhaka’s spiritual advancement. Through service—service to Krishna and to the great souls who have taken exclusive shelter of Krishna—I can develop genuine eagerness to hear about Him. The service attitude I cultivate becomes the very basis by which I can attract Krishna’s mercy. I pray to imbibe this true spirit of service, where no obstacle, excuse, or hesitation can impede my execution of Your Divine instructions.\n \n In your recent lecture on Srila Prabhupada’s disappearance day during the Kartik Yatra at Govardhan, you explained that when a disciple sincerely follows the vani of his spiritual master, then the vapuh of the Guru manifests within the disciple’s heart. Such a disciple never feels separated from his Guru, not even for a moment. Guru Maharaj, I long to purify my heart so that I may truly invite you to reside there.\n \n I have a long journey ahead, yet I aspire to progress steadily on this path. Your love, shelter, and blessings are the anchor that will help me become receptive to the boundless mercy of our Acharyas and transform my heart, develop the love for Krsnas holy names, pastimes, his abode, his devotees and his seva.\n \n Thank you is a small and insignificant word. Yet I offer this from the deepest cores of my heart. I feel immensely blessed and loved as I write this heartfelt offering. I pray that I never fail you and that you never give up on me.\n Your daughter,\n Vrajabhumi Devi Dasi"

You always desire to serve selflessly with a caring nature and never see bad in others, never criticize, and are always engaged in undivided devotional service with a simple and sober heart.\n \n Dear Gurudev, you preach with your actions. What attracts people is not philosophy but the conduct of a person, and we all witnessed very well during KY 2025 how you respect even a child and how gracefully you reciprocated with your Godbrothers and Godsisters.\n \n Dear Gurudev, your kindness and words of love are completely changing the hearts of people all over the world.\n \n Dear Gurudev, you teach us how to love and serve Krishna, and before that, how to serve and deal with devotees. You always stressed upon how our dealings should be with our senior Vaishnavas and devotees. We must serve them with utmost sincerity and without any personal motives. This is the true essence of bhakti and the mission of Srila Prabhupada: how to remain united and have loving relationships and be helpful to each other.\n \n I heard from a devotee once an Indian chess player came to Gurudev and said, \"Swami ji, how did you become attracted to OUR Krishna?\" Gurudev said to him, \"This white boy got checkmated by your black king of Vraja.\" So we see how gracefully and humorously Gurudev replied to him in his chess language, as he was a chess player.\n \n Gurudev is so simple and humble. Even big leaders and industrialists take shelter and take guidance from him, but Gurudev always remains so humble and down-to-earth with no limelight. Rather, he gives limelight to his dear disciples when they do any little efforts in the mission of Srila Prabhupada.\n \n So, on this very, very auspicious occasion of Maharaj\u0027s 75th Vyas Puja, I pray at his lotus feet to shower his mercy upon me and my family so that we can continue chanting 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra and follow all four regulations in principle and engage our lives in serving the mission of Lord Chaitanya and Srila Prabhupada without any ulterior motives.

With folded hands, I convey my deep gratitude for the life-giving message You have given.\n \n In Your talk, You emphasized that much of our wasted energy arises from incessant worry—worry about the future, worry about our relationships, our image, our security. You reminded us that our real identity is not merely this body or the material framework, but a divine soul, eternally connected with the Supreme. I was especially struck when You said that to stop worrying is not merely to push away anxiety, but to replace it with true aim and service—living for something larger than our personal fears.\n \n That single insight has already begun to shift something in my heart. I have noticed how when I worry about some outcome, I shrink inward, distracted from serving others, from remembering the Lord, from participating in the divine play. But Your words encouraged me: rather than being defined by problems, I can define myself by devotion, by love, by offering whatever I have to the Lord and His servants.\n \n Dear Gurudev, I make this humble offering to You of my heartfelt resolve:\n \n To recognize more deeply that I am a spiritual being and so free of ultimate entanglement in material results.\n To channel my energy into loving service: helping others, supporting the mission, connecting with the devotees in a spirit of humility and sincerity.\n To remember the Lord and chant faithfully, so that even when challenges arise I can ‘shift gears’ from worry-mode into remembrance-and-service-mode, as You advised.\n \n Your compassionate presence and Your teaching are guiding lights for me. I pray that by Your mercy I may gradually become more peaceful within, more steady in my purpose, more joyful in devotional service. And I earnestly ask that You accept this offering of my sincere intention and weak endeavor. I am aware that without Your mercy and the mercy of the Lord, I can neither stop worrying nor truly begin living in the highest sense.\n \n Please kindly accept my humble pranams at Your Lotus Feet and pray for me so that I may become a stronger instrument of this message: that genuine living begins when we surrender worry and step into selfless devotion.\n With endless gratitude and unconditional service,\n Your pitiable servant,\n Vrajendra Kishor Das"

The vivid details of the pastimes you describe are an insight into your revelations, from complete surrender.\n\nYour lifetime of selfless sacrifice to spread the mission of your Guru Maharaja has empowered you to change the hearts of countless souls in this world. During the three decades I have known you, Guru Maharaja, you have never taken any credit for your accomplishments, even though during long periods of your life, they have been exhausting to execute; such is your loving dedication. Your leadership and vision to expand the mission of Srila Prabhupada are multi-faceted. You have made the impossible possible by the dint of your fathomless, unflinching faith in Guru and Sri Krsna. Your resolute dedication is unbreakable, and naturally, you are resourceful to make any project a success. Projects like Food Relief to school children, Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Govardhan Eco Village, Radha Gopinath Temple with its programs for spiritual education, counseling, devotee care, schools, and orphanages, to name just a few, are a tribute to your profound vision to touch every person’s life. Making bhakti yoga a spiritual practice for everyone and anyone. A truly grounded tradition that cares and acts for everyone’s eternal welfare, no matter what your background, culture, citizenship, color, nationality, age, gender, or disposition.\n\nYou have many times quoted that “a true leader is one who makes others leaders.” You have made hundreds of leaders over the years, and they have gone on to make so many more leaders. Such is the depth and width of your transcendence.\n\nIt is with heartfelt gratitude on your 75th appearance day that we offer our prostrated obeisances again and again at your lotus feet. We sincerely pray that we may follow in your footsteps and aspire to mold our lives to give everything to Krsna and nothing for ourselves so that we may in some way embrace true selflessness as you have inculcated the spirit of the pure Vaishnava residence of Vrindavan.\n\nMay you eternally remain our father, guide, Guru, and master, and may we always reciprocate with unflinching loving servitude, no matter what.\n\nMay you have good health and longevity to spread further the unlimited mercy of Sri Sri Gaura-Nitai and Their intimate followers. You are our worshipable Lord and master always.\n\nYour utterly insignificant servants,\n\nVrajendralal das \u0026 Family\nISKCON Manchester, UK"

This year Kartika yatra was so special, like every year. It was only because of your desire that we had the greatest and rarest of fortune of staying in Govardhan for 7 days and nights. We are so grateful to you. Every moment was so unique and special. You nourished us with such wonderful hari katha for hours and hours. We may feel tired at times, but your enthusiasm to speak hari katha is never diminished. You gave so many important instructions on how to cultivate the mood of a beggar, how each moment is so precious in association of devotees, how we should take shelter of the holy name, and how Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has come to give us the highest benediction. You always concluded your katha by speaking about Gaura Lila. Please bless me so that I can take shelter of your lotus feet through your vani.\n\nAs always, you performed most enchanting kirtans and you made everyone cry out for Krsna. You gave us the most beautiful spiritual experience of our life. As you mentioned so many times in your katha, we are not qualified to receive this, but due to your and Srila Prabhupada\u0027s causeless mercy on us, we received these precious gifts. We are eternally grateful to you.\n\nWe had a wonderful experience of cooking for Govardhan Puja under the lotus feet of Govardhan. As you mentioned in your class that day, it was so purifying, both externally and internally, for body, mind, and heart. You personally visited the cooking area to encourage all devotees; you showered your merciful glance on all and blessed us all, and by your and Giriraj\u0027s blessings, devotees could make more than 3500+ offerings of love and devotion. Thank you so much guru maharaj for this experience.\n\nGuru Maharaj, only and only by your mercy, I am trying to do some insignificant services here like taking kids\u0027 classes, participating in weekly programs, helping in organizing festivals and cultural events, participating every day in reading Srila Prabhupada\u0027s books, and trying to imbibe those teachings.\n\nI beg for your mercy so that I can follow your instructions sincerely, seriously, become a humble servant, learn to be tolerant, and work in cooperation with other devotees, by giving all respects to others and not expecting anything in return. You always teach us by your own example these Vaishnava qualities, but I fail to imbibe them. I beg you to please forgive me for all my shortcomings, for all my offenses unto your lotus feet.\n\nPraying to seek your blessings on this most auspicious 75th appearance day.

        "Your Offering ":  "Hare Krishna dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\nAll glories to you. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to Gauranga.\n\nI am feeling immensely fortunate and grateful to get this opportunity to meditate on your glories, how you have touched our lives so deeply, and how you are our savior.\n\nDear Gurudev, you are an ocean of transcendental qualities. On this occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja, I want to meditate on two of those: your unflinching loyalty to Srila Prabhupada and your emphasis on collective unity.\n\nThis year in Kartik Yatra, we saw how even some of the early disciples of Srila Prabhupada were expressing their gratitude to you for being instrumental in their lives in deepening their connection with Srila Prabhupada. This is a testimony to how you are a perfect follower of Srila Prabhupada. I have heard that in early days, Srila Prabhupada had instructed you to learn deity worship from HG Jananivas pr. When Srila Prabhupada received two instructions for his spiritual master, he created ISKCON and BBT respectively to fulfill those instructions perpetually. In one of your lectures in Kartik Yatra, when you mentioned how HG Jananivas pr is head pujari of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Temple, Chowpatty, I was thinking how you have also done something similar in pursuance of your Guru\u0027s order. On this day, Maharaj, I seek your mercy and empowerment so that I can remember, meditate upon, and follow your instructions to the best of my capacity and become your worthy disciple.\n\nWe have repeatedly heard from you the importance of staying united in the service of Srila Prabhupada. Indeed, in today\u0027s age of quarrel, hypocrisy, and disagreement as Srila Prabhupada writes in his purports, this is going to be our most important weapon against Maya. You repeated this while describing the lila where Varun deva\u0027s servants had wrongly captured Nanda Maharaj. The vrajbasis, anxious at the shore, were united like one family. And you said, \"In a devotee community, when we say \u0027us\u0027 or \u0027we\u0027, it means we are all together, honoring and serving and respecting each other to serve Krishna. This is the meaning of keeping Krishna in the center of our community and relationships.\" Gurudev, I beg at your lotus feet, may I get strength to keep aside my false ego and cultivate a genuine service attitude towards my superiors, equals, and juniors in the mood of a humble servant of a servant.\n\nBefore the initiation ceremony of my wife, Sundari Vishakha devi dasi, in Chowpatty temple in 2012, in HG Gauranga pr\u0027s pre-brief, he mentioned how one who receives shelter of a bonafide Guru is very fortunate; one who gets to hear from such a Guru is more fortunate; and one who gets to repeatedly hear from such a Guru is most fortunate. Maharaj, I pray at your lotus feet that may I get the sincerity, desire, and determination to hear from you repeatedly and take shelter of your vani.\n\nDear Maharaj, on Srila Prabhupada\u0027s disappearance day, you ended your class by saying, \"On this day, we can remind ourselves what is important to us. Otherwise, we get distracted by so many fears and temptations of Maya.\" On this most auspicious day of your 75th Vyas Puja, Gurudev, I seek your mercy and empowerment to be able to overcome my fears and temptations and dedicate my life more and more to become a better sadhaka, better sevaka, and better sainika in the service of Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas. Thank you, Maharaj, for so patiently guiding us and showing the way for our ultimate welfare.\n\nYour aspiring servants of your servants,\nVyas Acharya das and family wife: Sundari Vishakha devi dasi, brother: Paavan Nitai das, sister-in-law: Radhika Ruchi devi dasi, mother: Sudha Lakshmi devi dasi, father: Krishna Krida das, and children: Pradyumna, Parth, Prahlad, and Radhika."

But only by Your mercy, I got this magical boat. The boat of spirituality, the boat which is filled, full of mercy, in which I get the association of devotees, through which one can attain the spiritual abode, and through which one can attain the goal of life, Krishna Prem.\n \n Maharaj, when I read your *Journey Home*, then by seeing your eagerness to know about spirituality, I am very amazed. Because for gaining knowledge of Bhakti, you do so much struggle, so much hard work for it. And before this, I have never seen or heard about anyone that he is struggling so much for gaining spiritual knowledge. After reading *Journey Home*, my perspective toward Indian culture, spirituality totally changed. After reading the book, I realized that this knowledge I get very easily is not ordinary knowledge; this is the goal of our life, through which we can be able to achieve our goal of life, Krishna Prem. But unfortunately, I am taking it very cheaply. Somehow, I am not able to take this path of Bhakti very seriously. I am doing daily 16 rounds, but while chanting, I am so distracted, not doing with proper intention and attention. Maharaj, please give me mercy so that I will be able to chant very nicely. I will be able to take this path of Krishna Consciousness very seriously and be able to serve in Srila Prabhupada\u0027s Mission.\n \n Maharaj, by hearing Srila Prabhupada\u0027s lectures, by reading books, I got some knowledge about Bhakti, but somehow, I am lacking in faith. Like, by Krishna\u0027s mercy, His some qualities can go into His devotees also. Like everyone is writing offerings to you, and you will know that who wrote this offering; you will read all devotees\u0027 offerings without actually physically reading it. Now I am writing this offering to you, and you will read this offering, but somehow, while writing also, I have not completely faith that you will read it. So, Maharaj, please bless me so that my faith in Shastras, my faith in my Shiksha Guru, our Guru Parampara will increase more and more.\n \n Maharaj, I like to hear your lectures, especially when devotees ask doubts; when someone asks some questions, then I am very excited to hear your answer to that question because your perspective to see this world, problems, are totally different. You see the whole world with *prem chakshu*. I am very amazed that you are very affectionate towards all living beings without developing any attachment with them.\n \n Maharaj, please give mercy to me, my brother Om, my beloved mother-father, and grandfather. Please bless us so that my mother, father, brother, and grandfather take this process of Krishna Consciousness and start practicing devotional service. Seeing my family chanting Hare Krishna Mahamantra is one of the best days in my life. Your *Journey Home* is very, very nice that I gifted this book to my mother on her birthday, and she also completed this book and liked it very much. Please, Maharaj, bless my beloved mother so that she will also start to practice devotional service with full eagerness and enthusiasm. Also, Maharaj, please bless all my relatives, all my friends, my friends Ajit, Abhijeet, Madhav, Avdhut, Adarsh, Mauli, Suraj, Abhishek, Sujay, and many more friends. By Krishna\u0027s mercy, they have very nice good qualities, but somehow they are not taking this process of Krishna consciousness. Please bless them so that they can able to understand the importance of Bhakti and they will eagerly take this process of Bhakti also. Please help me to overcome lusty thoughts which are within my mind. Please help me to clean my heart which is filled with all six types of diseases, and please help me to always remember Krishna and His devotees. As HG Gauranga Prabhuji serves you, HG Radheshyam Prabhuji serves you, and many more devotees serve you, serve in this Mahaprabhu\u0027s Mission. I also desire to serve you, desiring to serve in this Mahaprabhu\u0027s Mission according to my ability. Please help me, please bless me, and please pray for me to Lord Radha Gopinath. If you pray, then Lord definitely gives His mercy to me. Please help this fool, please guide me, Maharaj.\n All glories to Shri Guru \u0026 Gauranga..!!!\n Shrila Prabhupada ki Jay...❤️"

Your every word pierces the ice of my desires of being in this world and increases the desire to go back where I eternally belong.\n Gurumaharaj, I find myself utterly unqualified — me being a totally neophyte who is trying to be a devotee in the first place. What can this tiny small brain offer to you? Neither do I have any knowledge nor any saamarthya. Gurudev, I accept I know nothing except one thing — that I have given myself completely at your lotus feet. I offer myself in the selfless service of Srila Prabhupada and you.\n This servant of yours is desperately aspiring for your shelter... Till the last breath of my life, I would want to serve you. Without your presence in my life, Gurudev, my life is like a desert place maru bhumi where there cannot be any hope of sprouting — unless your words in Hari Katha, like rain showers, drench this place of my heart which is like a desert. Then there can be hope for the sprouting of Krishna bhakti.\n This eternal dasi of yours has accepted you as spiritual master from the core of the heart.\n Please accept me at your lotus feet and save my existence by giving me your shelter, oh Gurudev!!\n Please forgive this fallen and most insignificant servant of yours for all the mistakes and shortcomings.\n Thank you so much Gurudev for everything. Words can never express the gratitude and how much we owe to you!!\n Eternal aspiring servant at your lotus feet,\n Yashshree"

        "Your Offering ":  "nama om vishnu-padaya krishna-preshthaya bhu-tale\nsrimate radhanath-svamin iti namine\n\nnama om vishnu-padaya krishna-preshthaya bhu-tale\nsrimate bhaktivedanta-svamin iti namine\nnamas te sarasvate deve gaura-vani-pracarine\nnirvisesha-sunyavadi-pascatya-desa-tarine\n\nDear Gurumaharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet.\n\nGurudev, for some years, we have been showing an animated short film to college boys in our preaching program. It shows the rat race for material happiness and reveals the truth of material happiness as illusory and temporary. Whenever I see this video, I think that most people in this world don\u0027t know that they are suffering. Some of them know that they are suffering, but for them, it is just an unavoidable part of life. And very few of them feel frustrated with suffering, but they don\u0027t know how to get out of it. And very, very few know that spirituality can help, but they get misdirected. And in all this, very, very, very few get the rarest opportunity to connect with the bonafide disciplic succession and get saved by substituting material happiness with spiritual happiness through service to the Lord and His devotees. In all this, I don\u0027t stand anywhere because I have got this opportunity not because of my inquisitiveness, but it\u0027s the rarest causeless mercy of yours that has saved me.\n\nIn one class, you were saying that Lord Gauranga gave mercy to the animals of Zarikhand forest, but the animals had to accept that mercy before they got it. After hearing this, I was questioned philosophically because, as per my tiny knowledge, animals don\u0027t have the capacity to accept or reject anything beyond their destiny. I asked this to HG Vilas Vardhan Prabhu at Govardhan. Prabhu told me that in such cases, the Lord also gives the capacity to accept the mercy with the mercy. Prabhu said that just like animals, we have to consider ourselves like animals who are unqualified but have been blessed with mercy, and in that mood, we shall pray to Lord Giriraj. When I heard this explanation, I was humbled and started reflecting that, actually, before coming to VOICE, I was just an animal, but by your mercy, through various devotees, I got the opportunity to save myself.\n\nSince the last Kartik Yatra at Shridham Mayapur, I was eagerly waiting for this year\u0027s Kartik Yatra. One thing I was convinced of was that as in Mayapur, I was not able to always remain conscious of the greatness of holy places, of holy dham, and pray properly there, so visiting holy places used to become a very mechanical activity for me. Hence, I was simply waiting to give my best to hear your classes. When you sang the disappearance song for Srila Prabhupad, you made me cry in gratitude and humility for some moments in my life.\n\nGurudev, I was hearing your glories from many devotees and was moved to understand what kind of mercy I have received. In various departments of Dham Darshan, there was a Crowd Care department, and as HG Achyut Mohan Prabhu mentioned that your mood of love and care is reflected in the whole Yatra, I had seen the word \"Crowd Control\" but not \"Crowd Care\" until now, anywhere. But for the first time, I saw this as a reflection of your mood.\n\nGurudev, your love and loyalty for Srila Prabhupad inspire me deeply. I remember hearing how you were attentive about which places in Prayag various pastimes of Srila Prabhupad had happened, and you told HG Achyut Mohan Prabhu to research it. You revived Ultadanga Junction at Kolkata as one of the most important places for ISKCON. You served Srila Prabhupad wholeheartedly at New Vrindavan and later created Vrindavan at Wada.\n\nGurudev, your Vani gives me true shelter and strength. I have not been able to do any tangible service to you, Gurudev. Whatever devotees say about me is not actually done by me. It is just the desire of devotees, the support of devotees, the push of devotees, done by devotees, and at the end, credited to me just out of their compassion. I am simply a fortunate fool who has been immensely blessed.\n\nGurudev, you know me in and out and how much degraded my consciousness is, but at Govardhan, while glorifying Srila Prabhupad, you said that \"Srila Prabhupad will never leave anyone even if one leaves Srila Prabhupad.\" Similar is the hope for me that You and Srila Prabhupad will never leave me. And my sincere prayers at your lotus feet are that I may never forget you and Srila Prabhupad and always remain grateful to all who have, who are, and who will help me in remaining Krishna Conscious.\n\ninsignificant servant of your servants"

She has always embodied the love and humility that you so perfectly represent.\n\nI am deeply grateful that your blessings to her, and through her to me, have silently guided my life all these years — leading me to the association of many wonderful senior devotees and, once again, to her during this sacred yatra.\n\nI remain an undeserving, disillusioned, egoistic, and materialistic being — yet, time and again, your compassion and blessings help me become a little better and draw closer to the path of devotion.\n\nWith folded hands and a heart full of gratitude, I pray for your continued mercy and good health.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nYukti Nautiyal Jaguri"
