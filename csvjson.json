All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\nPlease accept my humble obeisances, dear Guru Maharaj.\nOn this, my dearest day, your appearance day, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your mercy, your example of pure devotion to Srila Prabhupada, and your commitment to his mission.\nAlmost a year has passed since the initiation you bestowed upon me on Srila Prabhupada's behalf.\nThroughout this time, I have tried to follow your instructions and your example.\nThis year has been a very difficult test for our family.\nMy husband nearly lost his life. He spent three and a half months in the hospital, and only thanks to your prayers and the prayers of devotees was he able to overcome his illness and is now in rehabilitation.\nJust before Anantatma Prabhu was released from the hospital, our son Nimai Krishnachandra was drafted into the army. And only thanks to the prayers of devotees is he alive and continuing his spiritual practice in military conditions.\nDear Guru Maharaj, once, in Chowpatty Temple, in answer to my question: Can a person with my past hope for salvation You said, \"Serve the devotees, serve the exalted devotees, that will save you.\"\nSince then, I have tried to follow your words, and by the grace of HH Keshava Swami, Anantatma Prabhu and I perform any service that Maharaj tells us.\nFor three years, we've been organizing trips around India for him and his disciples, including pilgrimages to Vrindavan, Puri, and Mayapur. In November, he'll be bringing groups to Govardhan Ecovillage.\nMaharaj provides much service through caring for devotees, and every time, in different situations, I remember your example, Guru Maharaj�how you care for devotees and how you teach us to treat them.\nIt can be very difficult in situations of injustice to remember Krishna and the soul, and at such moments, a phrase you said in one of your lectures comes to mind: \"If you're right, you're still wrong.\"\nThis helps to soften the situation and maintain relationships.\nI won't take up much of your time, dear Gurudev.\nI'll conclude my letter with words of immeasurable gratitude for all the lessons you've taught me.\nEspecially the lesson of your faith in us disciples, when on May 4, 2024, we sat in the Moscow temple with new kanthimalas around our necks, awaiting initiation, and you informed us of Gopal Krishna Goswami's grave condition and the cancellation of the initiation.\nAt that moment, a cry of \"Jai, Gurudev!\" burst from my heart.\nI felt that, despite being one twenty-thousandth part of a family of disciples, you spiritually love and believe in me�in my strength and steadfastness, in my ability to understand you without words.\nAnd at that moment, I also understood the true meaning of your words, \"We are Prabhupada's family.\"\nI felt that it was at that moment that you united me with this family.\nBy denying me the ritual of initiation, you initiated us into the original essence of the science and practice of bhakti.\nYou taught me a second, very important lesson without words when, after a week at Ecovillage, I left for Puri to continue my service to Keshava Swami and my husband, Anantatma Prabhu.\nWhen you heard about my plans, you made a gesture with your hand as if you were touching the ground and smiled approvingly.\nAt that moment, I realized what was truly dear to your heart was not my presence, but my unceasing service to the Vaishnavas�those dear to the Lord and Srila Prabhupada.\nThank you so much, dear Guru Maharaj, for your mercy and generosity toward me.\nI think of you in every event, every day, no matter what happens.\nI remember your words and your example first and foremost.\nIn this way, I learn to live as you once told me: \"No matter how far we may be, we must learn to live as if I were always near.\"\nThis year, the Tomsk Yatra organized a wonderful Ratha Yatra festival, and evenings dedicated to Srila Prabhupada continue to be held.\nEvery day, the temple prepares a beautiful bhoga offering to Sri Sri Nitai Gaura Chandra, and every evening of the week, interesting programs are organized for the parishioners.\nBowing at your feet, I tearfully pray:\nPlease bless me with pure love for Radha and Krishna,\nAn unbreakable connection with the mission of Srila Prabhupada,\nAnd a strong taste for serving the Vaishnavas..."

You are dear to my heart, for you have opened your life and the secrets of your heart for the world to see, allowing me, through your Journey Home, to understand what a true Vaiava feels and endures in his journey toward attaining bhakti.\n�Just like merciful persons, the clouds gave their lives for the pleasure of this world.� � rmad Bhgavatam 10.20.6.\nYour love for r Krishna pierces my heart again and again: when the mah-mantra, out of its own sweet will, arose from the depths of the Gag to you; when the blue boy playing a flute appeared from a stack of prints in New Delhi; when you cried out, �Ka! His name is Krishna!� upon seeing His name for the first time at Cross Maidan in rla Prabhupda�s Krishna Book; when you trembled in gratitude as Prabhupda�s unspoken words �Ka is waiting for you� entered your heart; when you listened to the pastimes of Krishna stealing butter and being caught by Mother Yaod from Nryaa Prasd; when Lord Rma appeared to Rma Sevaka Swami and instructed him, �This young boy is a devotee of Krishna; speak to him only about the glories of Ka�; when you arrived in Mathur on Janmam day, only to be lovingly tricked by Krishna to keep you in Vndvana; when you witnessed the spontaneous love of Kadsa Bbj, who chanted Ka�s names day and night; when you heard of Krishna calling out to the gops with the sweet songs of His flute, and how they abandoned everything to run toward Him on that rsa-prim night; when you fixed your heart upon the enchanting sight of r Rdh and Krishna dancing beneath the moonlit sky as described by Bon Mahrja; when you received the most confidential secrets of rmat Rdhr�s love from Vikh araa Bb; when you closed your eyes in Rdh�s forest (Barsn) and felt the love of r Rdh and Krishna showering upon you; and when you received the invisible, mystical blessings of r Rpa Gosvm at his samdhi.\n�My dear friend, if you are indeed attached to your worldly friends, do not look at the smiling face of Govinda as He stands on the bank of the Yamun at Kegha.� � Caitanya-caritmta, di-ll, 5.224\nMahrja, you have taught me countless lessons throughout your life.\nFrom your dealings with sdhus of various sampradyas, such as Bon Mahrja, Kadsa Bbj, Ramesh Bb, Ghanasym, and much more, you have taught me the principle of seeing the hearts of devotees beyond sectarian boundaries, never becoming crippled by the small-mindedness of building walls of division. Even harboring a trace of hatred toward a Vaiava in the mind is detrimental to one�s own bhakti. May I etch this truth deep within my heart and never forget it.\n�If by chance the offense of hatred, malice or criticism of a Vaiava occurs, the person should be repentant, recognizing his own low nature in having committed the offense, and should nullify the offense by lamenting, resolving to come before the Vaiava, fall at his feet, and satisfy him by offering his obeisances, praises and respects.� � Mdhurya-kdambi, third shower.\nWhen you once felt remorse for imitating a camera click to help a friend, realizing later that it hurt a Vaiava�s heart, you taught me the gravity of never causing pain to any devotee, whether in the name of preaching, philosophical argument, missionary activity, or trying to shove my own understanding of Krishna consciousness into someone�s throat to choke him.\n�Nor should one think that the offense of sdhu-nind operates only in relation to a Vaiava who is fully and perfectly endowed with all the qualities mentioned in scripture, such as tolerance, mercy and kindness to all living entities. Such a person attempts to minimize his own offense by pointing out some defect in the Vaiava.� � Mdhurya-kdambi, third shower.\nWhen you resisted pressures from disciples of various gurus who sought to impose their own dogmas upon you, you taught me �resistance�, and taught me to follow one�s own inner calling, of fanning the spark of love for Krishna that arises uniquely in each heart.\n�So different devotees have different inclinations to offer his service to different features of God.� � rla Prabhupda, December 15th 1966, New York\nThrough your resolve to serve within ISKCON and your endeavors to associate harmoniously with your godbrothers despite differences, you taught me that the real unity of devotees lies not in uniformity but in cooperation, serving r r Rdh-Krishna according to one�s own calling under the guidance of r Guru, in the movement of rla Prabhupda.\n�Advanced devotees can understand and appreciate the different varieties of devotional service reciprocated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.� � Caitanya-caritmta, madhya-ll, 23.99.\nWhen you changed the spirit of book distribution, urging that we strive to distribute more and yet pray to �come last�, you taught me a very important principle to focus on humility and the genuine fruits of bhakti in the form of one�s own attraction to r Rdh and Krishna, rather than nourishing the ego by chasing the honour from others by so-called �spiritual� achievements.\n�Humility means the freedom from the anxiety of having the satisfaction of being honoured by others.� � r Guru\nThrough your life, you have shown that both bhajannands and gohynands are exalted in their own ways, and that you yourself embody both aspects in your personality. This teaches me the greatness of our parampar, where some cryas are immersed in deep internal bhajana, while others are dedicated to preaching and outreach�each perfectly serving r Krishna according to their nature.\n�The best devotional service for a devotee is that by which he attains complete satisfaction and joy. He should do it with full faith, for it will bring the desired result since it is done with affection. The saintly authorities consider that service to be the essence of a devotee�s goal for it will manifest prema.� � Bhad-bhgavatmta 2.3.152\nAs the years carry us further from the time of rla Prabhupda�s earthly presence, we risk drifting from the full, multifaceted, all-accommodating vision of his personality. Therefore, I pray at your lotus feet: may I develop ever-deepening love and understanding of rla Prabhupda; may gratitude and affection for the Vaiavas ever increase within me; may I cultivate a thirst for stric study and, if you so desire, share that understanding with others; may I awaken intense greed for the divine service of r Rdh and Krishna in the mood of r Rpa Gosvm. And may I realize the true meaning of the name you have so mercifully bestowed upon me.\n�Taking straw in my teeth, I pray again and again: May I become a piece of dust at the lotus feet of rla Rpa Gosvm, birth after birth.� � Mukta-carita\nI pray to r Krishna for your long, healthy life, Gurudeva, so that you may continue to inspire millions of souls like my fallen self.\nYour servant,\nVraja Jvana Dsa"

Words are too limited to express the depth of my indebtedness to you, but still, with whatever little sincerity I have, I wish to glorify you.\n\nYou are the embodiment of compassion.\n\nFrom your early life, when you walked across continents in search of truth, to your present mission of uplifting countless hearts, every moment of your journey reflects the mercy of the Lord.

You teach us that chanting the holy names, serving the devotees, and cultivating humility are the essence of spiritual success.\n\nEven a single glance from you carries warmth and understanding. You make every soul feel seen, loved, and valued. Your smile reveals the beauty of Krishna�s mercy; your silence carries the weight of divine realization.\n\nOn this 75th Vyasa Puja, I offer you my gratitude and vow:\n\nI will try to chant my rounds sincerely every day, praying for genuine devotion rather than ritual.\nI will study your words and Srila Prabhupada�s books with attention, and let them shape my thoughts and actions.\nI will strive to serve others with humility and without expectation, remembering your example.\nI will do my best to maintain harmony among devotees and avoid offenses.\nI will dedicate whatever small abilities I have � my speech, my mind, my energy � in service to the sankirtana mission that you are carrying forward.\n\nYou are the lighthouse of my life, guiding me safely across the ocean of material existence. When I feel lost, your voice brings clarity. When I feel weak, your life gives me strength. When I forget Krishna, your example reminds me of what truly matters � loving devotional service.\n\nYour kindness is my only hope. Without your mercy, I have no shelter. I pray that someday, by your grace, I may truly become an instrument of your will and a servant of your devotees.\n\nI beg the Lord on this day to grant you long life, good health, and endless strength so that you can continue to inspire and uplift the entire world. May millions more discover Krishna consciousness through your compassion. May your teachings shine eternally, lighting up generations to come.\n\nPlease forgive my countless shortcomings and offenses.\n\nWhatever impurities still reside in me, I place them at your lotus feet and beg you to purify me through your mercy. Allow me to serve your mission in even the smallest way. Let my life become an offering of gratitude for all you have done.\n\nOn this sacred occasion of your 75th Appearance Day, I bow my head and heart at your feet � forever grateful, forever yours.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\n\nSunil"

This, I feel, is the most significant blessing you bestowed not only on me but on so many desperate people.\nI feel deeply grateful for the causeless mercy you have given me whenever I was passing a milestone in my devotional life. You were personally present in the temple just before I left for Mayapur and also Vrindavan for the first time in my life. I really felt empowered by your presence. This was just one instance, with multiple other anecdotes of receiving your compassion directly or indirectly.\nMy personal worshipable Lordships, Sri Sri Nimai Nitai, were actually sent for you by another devotee as a Janmashtami gift. But I believe it was your arrangement that, through several of your personal servants and devotees, the Lordships somehow came to me last year on Nandotsav day (2024). They are the greatest hope I received in a helpless crisis period in my life.\nI sincerely pray to you that I may be able to serve in a tangible, congenial way with other devotees of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath and be sensitive towards aligning with their mood, for your pleasure.\nThank you for everything.\nYour insignificant servant,\nChaitanya Pratosh"

By the grace and wish of Krishna, everything happened so quickly that within a short span of time, I was blessed to have such a great soul, HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj, as my spiritual master.\n\nI still remember the moment of initiation. I went to Maharaj with folded hands, completely blank, simply surrendering to Krishna. The moment Maharaj glanced at me and smiled, I cannot even express what I felt. Those few seconds of his divine smile filled me with immense hope. I felt deeply blessed, knowing that now someone was there � and will always be there � to guide me.\n\nEven though we cannot reach out to Maharaj directly for guidance, through his lectures, quotes, books, and social media updates, we are always connected and constantly guided on how to live our lives in Krishna consciousness.\n\nEvery morning, when I start my day and open Instagram or YouTube, the first thing I see is either a quote or a short video of Maharaj. I take it as inspiration or as a direct instruction from him for that day.\n\nI have no words to thank Maharaj for everything he has done, is doing, and will continue to do � for guiding so many souls, bringing them back on the right path, and reminding us of the true purpose of human life. Maharaj has also done so much for the future generations. Govardhan Ecovillage is one of the best examples of his compassion and vision. At a time when we have harmed and exploited nature so much, projects like Govardhan Ecovillage stand as a beacon of hope � promoting sustainability and showing us how to live in harmony with nature.\n\nDuring my time in Mumbai, when I was staying alone for about 2.5 years while my family was in Amritsar, I often visited the Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Temple, Chowpatty � the divine congregation created under Maharaj�s guidance. The moment you step into that temple, you feel you are home. The atmosphere makes you feel safe, sheltered, and blessed. The devotees there truly feel like family.\n\nI am certain that even if someday my friends or relatives fail to support me, these devotees � regardless of caste or background � will always stand by me. Because Maharaj has shown us that we are all one family, and our only purpose in life is to make Krishna happy and go back to Him.\n\nHonestly, there is so much more I want to say and thank Maharaj for. But I would like to end my offering here with a heartfelt thank you to Maharaj and a humble prayer:\n\nThat even though I am not capable, may I be of some use in fulfilling Maharaj�s mission. If I can do even a small service in that direction, I will feel that my life has truly become successful.\n\nYour servant,\nSridhar Priya Das"

What do they get from this�\nBut this process, as given by Lord Caitanya Mahprabhu, is so potent that if followed properly under the guidance of a spiritual master,\nIt will slowly help remove all the anarthas from our heart and lead us to the highest perfection � Krishna-prema.\nMaharaja, I pray that I try to follow your instructions and serve in the mission of rla Prabhupda in the mood of a servant of a servant of a servant.\n\nYour servant,\nSiddheshwar Anand Ds"

I ponder the lessons you taught silently in those cherished moments.\n\n(1)\nI first saw you in the Pune yatra 2008,\nAnd immediately got this message straight\nOf how much mutual love\nAnd cooperation meant to you,\nBy seeing how you treated your god-brothers\nAnd sisters with all the love and care due,\nAnd through your asking us to form\nMany small circles around\nTo dance together happily\nDuring the enchanting kirtan rounds.\n\nIt was also my first chance\nTo hear from you the trinadapi sunichena verse,\nOf being more tolerant than a tree\nAnd more humble than a blade of grass.\nA virtue that you practice yourself and emphasize\nAgain and again in almost every class.\n\n(2)\nI first approached you in New Vrindaban,\nWith the innocent impudence of a neophyte,\nTo seek your mercy and blessings for\nOur newly conceived maiden child.\nYou sweetly responded with a brimming heart\nThat you would pray with all your might.\nSo much love shown to a stranger,\nLeaving her fully satisfied.\n\n(3)\nThen you came to our home\nFor lunch the one and only time,\nAnd taught many lessons\nBy your gestures and actions pristine.\n\nInstead of ordering your preferences,\nYou asked where we wanted you to sit.\nSuch a humility and service attitude,\nTotally incomprehensible to our wit.\n\nYou offered due prayers\nBefore honoring prasad,\nGiving a peek into your\nSurrendered and grateful heart.\n\nAnd then when I mentioned\nThat I hailed from Nainital,\nYou immediately brought up\nNeem Karoli Baba and Kainchi dham.\nHidden behind this simple exchange\nWas a beautiful virtue at its best,\nOf never forgetting those who played\nA role in your spiritual quest.\n\n(4)\nThen when you gave me my first initiation\nIn Sri Sri Radha Kalachandji dham,\nYour servant of the servant mood\nWas the first thing that touched my heart.\nYou accepted us all on behalf of\nThe guru parampara and Srila Prabhupada.\n\nThe next was how much love and respect\nYou showed to your godbrothers at that time.\nYou generously glorified Srila Gurudev,\nHH Bhakti Sundar Goswami Maharaj\nAnd Urjasvat Prabhu's qualities sublime.\n\nAnd to see you sharing the vyasaasan\nLovingly during the fire sacrifice\nWith HH Bhakti Sundar Goswami Maharaj,\nOh, what a feast it was for our hearts and eyes!\n\nAnd, of course!

May I never forget how much I have been given. May I always cherish this treasure and always draw nourishment and spiritual strength from it. May my connection with you only grow stronger and stronger with time, and may I get the strength to practice earnestly what you have taught.

Your visit in April for the Harvard Divinity School program, followed by your two visits in September � to meet Ambarish Prabhu and to grace the grand celebration of Srila Prabhupada�s 60th Arrival Anniversary � were truly transcendental moments for all of us.\nWhile the scriptures teach that vani-seva surpasses vapu-seva, for a fallen soul like myself, it felt like the greatest blessing to personally receive your causeless mercy during each of your visits.

By the mercy of the Lord, I have received the rare opportunity to glorify the divine qualities of my most worshipable Gurudev. I offer my full aga daavat prams at the lotus feet of my revered Guru Mahrja.\n\nMy Guru Mahrja possesses unlimited transcendental qualities, but today I would like to speak on just a few of them�those which I have personally observed and learned from his divine behavior.\n\n\n---\n\n1. Gurudev�s Equal Vision and Affection for Everyone\n\nOne of the first qualities I learned from Guru Mahrja is his deep affection, respect, and attentive hearing toward all�whether they are his godbrothers, godsisters, or any devotee.\n\nEarlier, I had only read in the Bhagavad-gt the verse:\n\nvidy-vinaya-sampanne\nbrhmae gavi hastini\nuni caiva va-pke ca\npait sama-darina\n\nThis verse teaches equal vision toward all living beings.\nBut in the presence of Guru Mahrja, I see this verse living and walking.\n\nEven here at Govardhan Eco Village, Guru Mahrja offers respect and affection even to simple workers, greeting them lovingly with �Hare Krishna.� This teaches us how a true crya behaves�not by words alone, but by his personal example.\n\nGuru Mahrja even shows respect and kindness to the animals of Govardhan, including the dogs. By his actions, he teaches that a true learned person sees every living being as a child of God.\n\n\n---\n\n2. Gurudev�s Deep, Heart-Melting Chanting of the Holy Name\n\nWhen I observe Guru Mahrja chanting the holy name, I understand the true value of the Hare Krishna mah-mantra in this age of Kali.\nHis chanting is not mechanical�it is filled with devotion, absorption, and love.\n\nJust by seeing him chant, we realize how essential the Holy Name is for every person in this age.\n\n\n---\n\n3. Gurudev�s Divine Smile, Compassion, and Humility\n\nGuru Mahrja�s gentle smile removes all distress and pain from our hearts. His compassion, humility, respectfulness, and loving dealings are beyond ordinary description.\n\nGuru Mahrja does not merely instruct us�he demonstrates every teaching through his own life.\n\n\n---\n\n4. Gurudev Inspires Devotion in Everyone Who Meets Him\n\nBecause of Gurudev�s qualities, Govardhan Eco Village has become a spiritual home for countless people. Many visitors come as tourists, but after seeing the behavior of senior devotees and hearing Krishna-kath, their hearts transform�they begin to develop devotion and become inspired.\n\nThis miraculous transformation is the mercy of Guru Mahrja.\n\nEvery person who comes to Govardhan Eco Village is lovingly told:\n�This is your home.�\nThis simple statement creates warmth, belonging, and spiritual upliftment in everyone�s heart.\n\n\n---\n\n5. Gurudev Performs Every Service With Love\n\nGuru Mahrja never thinks he is above any service.\nHe personally performs seva�whether it is caring for the cows, serving matajis, encouraging devotees, or even showing affection to the donkeys in the village.\n\nEvery creature feels protected and loved in his presence.\n\n\n---\n\n6. His Senior Disciples Reflect His Teachings\n\nI also learn from the senior disciples of Guru Mahrja.\nTheir dedication, humility, and hospitality reflect the training given by Gurudev. They serve every guest with full energy and heartfelt respect.\n\nBy observing them, I understand more deeply the teachings that Guru Mahrja has instilled in all his followers.\n\n\n---\n\nMy Personal Prayer\n\nI pray at the lotus feet of Guru Mahrja:\n\n�May your mercy always remain upon me.\nPlease give me the strength, sincerity, and purity to serve your projects at Govardhan Eco Village with greater dedication.\nMay I always follow your teachings not only in words but through my actions.�"

It is always inspiring, motivating, and deeply transforming to hear from Maharaj.\nI am a native Hindi speaker, yet Maharaj ji�s English is so simple and soulful that I forget the difference between Hindi and English while listening to him. Maharaj ji�s autobiography, The Journey Home, is profoundly inspiring and evokes faith in Krishna Bhakti, which is already deeply embedded within our hearts.\nMaharaj ji�s journey from his home in the United States to Sri Vrindavan Dham dispels all doubts and deviations that often arise in the mind of a spiritual seeker. His great struggles on the path of Bhakti and his unshakable faith in the Lord, despite countless obstacles, are truly inspiring.\nEven in his childhood, while living in a materially affluent society, Maharaj ji was naturally inclined toward simplicity and deeply yearning for the search of the Supreme Lord. Though so many obstacles stood before him, Maharaj ji continued to follow only a ray of hope � a ray of reciprocation from Krishna � and in return for that divine reciprocation, he was ready to sacrifice everything material: his property, relationships, comforts, and attachments. He embraced whatever destiny Krishna chose for him.\nMaharaj ji�s great journey to India, his meetings with exalted souls such as Tut Wale Baba, Siddha Yogis, and many humble, loving saints like Kailash Baba, Ghanshyam Baba, and Ramesh Baba, ultimately led to his divine union with the ocean of mercy � His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada.\nThis journey beautifully demonstrates that although there are innumerable spiritual paths and many great souls following them, the love of Vrindavan Dham, Shrimati Radharani, and the Brajvasis is truly unparalleled.\nThis life is meant only to learn to follow in the footsteps of Param Pujya Radhanath Maharaj.\n Param Pujya Radhanath Maharaj ki Jai!

Devotees told me that accepting you as my spiritual master might mean little, if any, personal association. Though this made me nervous, I knew I had to accept it and learn to serve as your disciple regardless.\nYou are actually present before me at all times, giving me strength and inspiration to carry on. As rla Bhaktivinoda hkura sings, *ekaki mra nhi pya bala harinma-sakrtana* � on our own, we have no strength in devotional service and cannot propagate the glories of r Caitanya Mahprabhu. But simply by serving His bona fide representative, in the mood of the servant of the servant, we receive the most precious drop of faith.\nYour disciples are your limbs, and everything we do is actually done by you alone. By your divine instructions and flawless example, you nurture the creeper of faith within our hearts and allow us the privilege of serving Krishna through harinma-sakrtana.\nThe spiritual father or guru is dear because of his relationship with Krishna � the ultimate reality. Uddhava glorifies the Lord, explaining that Krishna appears externally as the crya in order to lead the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead. As Ka�s pure representative, you are our lifeline on the path of pure devotional service. Just as Krishna can simultaneously reciprocate with each of His devotees, you also reciprocate with your disciples. Through your lectures, you mirror His words, qualities, and desires � so that a conditioned soul like myself may find inspiration and guidance.\nThe life of rla Prabhupda is a tangible example of what it means to give oneself fully in Ka�s service, and you have followed in the wake of his lotus footsteps, devoting your entire life � from youth to old age � to inspiring and encouraging others to surrender to r Caitanya Mahprabhu�s lotus feet.\nI do not feel qualified to be the servant of such a glorious master as yourself, but as the Lord tells Prahlda Mahrja:\n�Those who follow your example will naturally become My pure devotees. You are the best example of My devotee, and others should follow in your footsteps.�\nTherefore, I feel justified in making the bold request that you please allow me to do as you have done � to give up all material desires, all petty weaknesses of heart, and all lingering ambitions for name and fame, and instead develop the spiritual desire to uplift others and devote my entire life in your service.\nAs rla Bhaktivinoda hkura prays, *akti-buddhi-hna mi ati dna, koro� more tma-stha* � although I am devoid of all strength and intelligence, I beg you to please make me your beloved servant.\nYour aspiring servant,\nBalarm Gopla Dsa"

    "Name of City you are from": "Bengaluru",
    "country": "(India)",
    "Your Offering": "Dearest Gurudeva,\n\nOn the most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, I take a few moments to appreciate your profound, glorious, transcendental, divine and yet deceivingly human-like qualities that take the form of an acronym RADHA:\n\nR � Relentless Consistency\nA � Anchored yet Adaptable\nD � Diligent Hearing\nH � Helpless Dependence, Thoughtful Action\nA � Absorption in what Truly Matters\n\n1) Relentless Consistency:\nThis time in the Kartik Yatra 2025 at Govardhan, a senior counselor from Radha Gopinath temple asked me, \"Do you know what's the evidence that Maharaja wants us to attend the Kartik yatra The proof is in the action, the hard efforts which Maharaja puts in at the age of 75 to come and speak for 3 hours everyday, lead an energetic blissful kirtan for another hour and informally speak to devotees for another hour.\" It struck me and when I contemplated this line of thought, I couldn't agree more. Gurudev, we see how you prepare meticulous notes for your evening kathas and ensure your presence in the pandal despite poor health, sometimes even when you're on the verge of collapsing due to bodily sickness. The depth of your chanting is clearly visible and audible during the kirtans, especially when you stop in between and request us to cry out with all sincerity from the core of our hearts, one million, billion and trillion times louder. You especially emphasize auspicious days such as Srila Prabhupada's disappearance day when you personally come and sing the prayer for departed Vaisnavas (Je anilo prema dhana) with utmost intensity, gravity and prayerfulness. If this is not evidence that demands our reciprocation, what else is All that we need to do is to be conscious attendees, striving to hear, contemplate and absorb every word and action that is demonstrated by you. But sometimes we fail to fulfill even this simple expectation. We must not think that we can skip the Kartik yatras because it's getting too congested with so many attendees or because we've now been around for several decades! Your consistency in every aspect of devotional service is simply mind-blowing and an outstanding example for us to emulate. Particularly your consistency in yourself leading Kartik yatras since 1986 (seeing it grow from 12 to 12,000 attendees in 40 years) is inspirational, given that you could easily choose to retire from the grueling yatra schedules, asking your competent senior disciples to lead instead. But you personally lead us even now because you care for us, our spiritual nourishment, upliftment and togetherness as a community united for a common cause. If there is one takeaway for me this Kartik yatra, it is, \"Never miss a Kartik Yatra as long as the legacy continues!\"\n\n2) Anchored yet Adaptable: Recently I have been contemplating another beautiful quality that you exhibit and which was glorified by an esteemed godbrother of yours. He said, \"Radhanath Swami is the most uncompromising yet completely open-minded person I have ever seen!\" This one sentence captures how you have expertly balanced fidelity to the parampara and flexibility in contemporary outreach, evident in your talks and dealings both on and off the vyasasana. In one of the evening talks in the Kartik yatra this year, you mentioned that we must be very careful to be kind and accommodating to each other and at the same time keep the ideal of pure devotional service intact. You said that most of us, being conditioned souls, are so far from that ideal that if we are not careful to keep track, we may end up never achieving that lofty goal of Krishna Prema. Generally, we tend to gravitate to extremes of compromise or rigidity and thus end up falling prey to criticism or envy. Through your example and words, though, we learn the art of fine balancing that is the very defining thread of Bhakti.\n\n3) Diligent Hearing: Another quality I'm trying to imbibe is to develop deep appreciation for your classes and instructions which can easily be missed if one is not attentive. For example, in your recent Kartik Yatra class this year, you mentioned that Madhavendra Puri, despite being embarrassed about Krishna personally coming to serve him with a pot of milk, did not allow that shame to become an obstacle in his service of excavating Gopal deity and installing him on Govardhan. This is a subtle but very critical point that shows us how devotional service is not about us (our bad or good times) but about pleasing the Lord and His devotees, a totally different realm and paradigm, far removed from this material world. Your diligence in hearing Srila Prabhupada's classes is evident as you so often quote from them in your classes, remembering the exact year, location, and theme of the class.\nIn this connection, I recall a beautiful contemplation by HG Vrajabihari pr, which I paraphrase here: \"Radhanath Swami has two aspects: a social Radhanath Swami and a spiritual Radhanath Swami. While the social Radhanath Swami blesses couples, gives names to babies, smiles lovingly at devotees and cares for their all-round holistic well-being, the spiritual Radhanath Swami pours out his heart, life, and blood into his classes, kirtans, and instructions for our spiritual progress, which he hopes we will deeply imbibe. Radhanath Swami, being a pure representative of the parampara, has not come to make our material lives better but rather to give us the greatest treasure, nothing less than pure devotional service.\" Generally, we look forward to and relish, cherish, and reminisce about the interactions of the social Radhanath Swami, but often fail to take your classes and kirtans seriously. We must strive to go beyond a superficial perspective and take deep shelter of your vani, which is kindly made available by RG Media in so many forms. You once said to a Belgaum mataji who had lovingly prepared Khichdi for you but you had to leave for the airport, \"You are feeling bad that I'm not eating your Khichdi, but I'm feeling sad that my disciples don't hear my talks, which I have cooked with so much love and concern!\" This is my prayer to you, Gurudev, that I can move forward from being a superficial to a substantial sadhaka and take advantage of the \"personal instructions\" in your love-cooked classes and kirtans.\n\n4) Helpless dependence, thoughtful independence: Another nuanced quality you exhibit, Gurudev, is treading the fine balance between helpless dependence and thoughtful independence in Krishna Consciousness. This means that we must practice deriving strength and nourishment in the association of devotees while simultaneously preparing to stand on our own feet (based on the nourishment received in Satsanga) without always depending on the physical association of devotees for every small detail. We see examples from your life in the Journey Home book, one of which happened at Mashed, Iran. Here you expressed a desire for solitude to Jeff and Ramsey and sat alone reading from the Quran in front of the holy mosque. From this, I gather that we must not fall prey to laziness and complacency in the name of dependence on Satsanga. In our own lives, by the force of circumstances beyond our control, we may be located in remote corners of the world without devotees, or in places where the existing ISKCON setup is plagued with infighting, power politics, and weak leadership. In these situations, instead of backing down and staying aloof, we must stand strong, preach, safeguard ourselves while respectfully cooperating with the local authorities to the best extent possible. This does not in any way undermine the importance of Satsanga but strives to remind us that there are times when we will be alone and we must be prepared for it. In fact, the time of death (with the Paramatma accompanying us) is largely a lonely journey, and we must prepare for it while we're alive and healthy. As Srila Prabhupada beautifully summarizes in the purport to SB 1.15.50, \"When flying an airplane, one cannot take care of other planes. Everyone has to take care of his own plane, and if there is any danger, no other plane can help another in that condition. Similarly, at the end of life, when one has to go back home, back to Godhead, everyone has to take care of himself without help rendered by another. The help is, however, offered on the ground before flying in space. Similarly, the spiritual master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband, and others can all render help during one�s lifetime, but while crossing the sea one has to take care of himself and utilize the instructions formerly received.\" As we spend years in the movement, we must learn to spend time absorbed in the Holy Name and sharavanam to develop our unique personal individual relationship with you and our \"private Paramatma,\" as you beautifully put it in one of your classes.\n\n5) Absorption in what truly matters: Gurudev, on your 75th birthday, when senior counselors asked you what gift they can offer, you mentioned 5 things that will please you:\n1. Go deep into hearing, chanting, and service.\n2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Krishna.\n3. Strive to be united as a community.\n4. Practice enthusiasm to share Krishna Consciousness.\n5. Never forget that Bhakti is not about quantity but about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n\nAnd you added, \"This is the answer I will give whether it is the 25th, 50th, or 75th birthday. Never compromise quality for quantity and infuse quality into quantity.\" What a gift, Gurudev! It is easy to say \"Radhanath Swami Ki Jai,\" but not as easy to be a devotee of substance rooted in hearing and chanting. I pray for the strength to follow these five instructions and particularly the first one of going deep into hearing, chanting, and service, which is the only means to stay connected with you on the spiritual platform perpetually (in favorable or adverse circumstances) and thus to the entire Gaudiya Vaishnava Guru Parampara, which you represent.\n\nYour Servant,\nDinabandhu Caitanya Das"

    "Your Offering": "Meeting with our dear Guru Maharaj in Alachua\n________________________________________\nMay/June 2025\nIt was the Memorial Day long weekend in the United States, a time when the Sadhu Sanga retreat is held annually. Devotees from across the country were traveling to attend, and it had been announced that several esteemed sannyasis and senior Vaishnavas would be present. Immediately following Sadhu Sanga, a special memorial program was scheduled in Deland, Florida, to honor the divine memory of His Holiness Bhakti Charu Maharaj. Many devotees from Atlanta planned to attend both events and then continue to Alachua, where our beloved spiritual master, His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj, was expected to spend a few days.\nIt was announced that Guru Maharaj would be giving the rmad-Bhgavatam class on Wednesday, followed by a panel discussion on Thursday evening with His Holiness Sivarama Swami Maharaj. All disciples were invited to attend the program in the temple room.\nRevathy and I decided to drive to Alachua from Atlanta, on Thursday to attend the panel discussion. We left Atlanta around 11:30 a.m. and reached Alachua by 5:00 p.m. After checking into a Holiday Inn and freshening up, we arrived at the temple by 5:35 p.m., only to find it surprisingly quiet. The temple room was nearly empty, and we saw very few devotees. Concerned, we tried reaching out to friends from Atlanta to confirm whether the program was still on, but received no immediate responses. We left messages, unsure of what to do next.\nWhile pondering our situation, I noticed a quiet Brahmachari honoring prasadam. I approached him and asked if the program had been canceled or moved. With a bright smile, he greeted me warmly, saying, �I�m so happy to see you, Mataji!� I replied, �I'm very happy to see you too.� When I inquired about the panel discussion, he informed me�rather regretfully�that it had recently been canceled.\nA bit disheartened, I asked if there were any other programs happening or if there might be a chance for a darshan with Guru Maharaj. He suggested I check with some matajis in the temple kitchen. As I made my way there, he suddenly came running to me with a spark of inspiration: �Call Pran Govind Prabhu. He�s with Maharaj and might know if there�s a home program.� He gave me the number, but as I already had it saved, I called immediately.\nTo my relief, Pran Govind Prabhu answered. I introduced myself and explained that we had driven all the way from Atlanta, hoping for even a brief darshan with Guru Maharaj. He asked, �Did you come from Charlotte� and I clarified, �No, from Atlanta.� He said, �Give me ten minutes. I will speak with Guru Maharaj and let you know.�\nWhile waiting in the temple room, Revathy and I debated whether we should just return home. I was growing impatient and felt sure no one would call us back. Our friends responded that since the program was canceled, they left to Orlando. Just as we reversed the car, ready to leave, my phone rang.\nIt was Pran Govind Prabhu: �Mother Preethivilasini, where are you�\n�I�m still at the temple,� I replied.\nHe said, �Guru Maharaj wants to talk to you!�\nI was stunned. �What! Okay!� I put the phone on speaker so Revathy could hear.\nThen came the most unexpected and heart-melting moment.\n�Hare Krishna Preethivilasini Mataji, please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada,� came the kind and gentle voice of our Guru Maharaj.\nOverwhelmed and choked up, we both offered our respectful obeisances and replied, �Hare Krishna Guru Maharaj!�\nHe continued, �So you drove all the way from Atlanta�\n�Yes, Maharaj.�\n�Unfortunately, the program was canceled. Sivarama Maharaj decided to cancel, and I was pulled into some private meetings; it has been an exhausting day. I�m sorry you came all this way only to find it canceled.�\nWe quickly responded, �Please, Maharaj, don�t apologize. We understand completely. Thank you so much for calling us�it means the world to us.�\nThen came the moment we will never forget.\n�Since you came all the way,� he said, �I will come and see you.�\nWe were stunned and said, �Maharaj!�\nHe said, �How many of you are there�\n�Just the two of us�my friend Revathy and me.�\nHe smiled, �I�ll come under one condition: I will meet you under a tree in the parking lot. I�m not coming inside the temple or anywhere there�s a crowd. This visit is just for you two.�\nWe said, �Guru Maharaj, we do not want you to take the trouble; we will come and see you there.�\nHe said, �Yes, it is a great trouble; I am surrounded by an ocean of crocodiles and snakes,� and he chuckled. He said, �I will see you in about 15 minutes.�\nWe were speechless.\nWe waited under a tree, soaking in the surreal beauty of the moment. Revathy said, �Should we ask him to sign a book Or maybe we should prepare a spiritual question� We nervously rehearsed what we might say.\nBut suddenly, it began to rain heavily�almost apocalyptically. We had to run to the car for shelter. I told Revathy, �Maybe we�re not destined to meet him after all.�\nShe calmly replied, �Who told you rain is a bad omen This rain is a blessing�it means Guru Maharaj will come.�\nI messaged Pran Govind Prabhu about the rain, saying Guru Maharaj needs shelter. His reply: �We will be there soon!�\nWithin minutes, a car zipped into the parking lot�it was Guru Maharaj and Pran Govind Prabhu!\nWe ran to the car and offered our obeisances. As we got up, Maharaj stepped out gracefully, looked up at the rain, and said with joy, �Ah! I like the rain!� Then he walked to the tree and gestured, �Come, come to the tree.�\nDespite the rain, he was cheerful, laughing and speaking with his characteristic warmth and humility.\nI said, �Guru Maharaj, it is raining; should we go to a place where there is shelter You are getting wet.� He said, �Where is it� I showed a distant shelter, and he dismissed that option, saying, �By the time we get there, we are going to get more wet!� and we agreed.\nI said, �Guru Maharaj, I�m so grateful that you prayed for my husband when he passed in 2020. I feel assured, by your mercy, that he has reached a safe destination.� He looked at me with such compassion. I continued, �Please bless us, that we may develop even a little love for Krishna and always remain loyal to you.�\nHe smiled.\nI then introduced Revathy, saying, �She has been aspiring to become an initiated disciple of you for 12 years.� Maharaj turned to her with a compassionate glance.\nRevathy humbly said, �Guru Maharaj, you�re supposed to be taking service from us, but here you are serving us instead.�\nMaharaj laughed deeply, �Yes! Indeed, you�re making me serve you!�\nThe rain soon stopped.\nPran Govind Prabhu, who was holding an umbrella, joked, �Even Indra is afraid of you, Maharaj!�\nMaharaj replied, �Now I�m taking credit for things I didn�t do!� and laughed again.\nGuru Maharaj said, �Don�t you think it�s good the program got canceled Otherwise, we wouldn�t have had this beautiful meeting under a tree! This is the highlight of my Alachua trip.�\nWe were overwhelmed. We replied in unison, �This is the highlight of our lives, Maharaj!�\nThen he asked, �How is Atlanta� I told him it is very nice and how I�d lived in many places but finally decided to settle there.\nPran Govind Prabhu added, �She conducts wonderful online classes.�\nGuru Maharaj asked for details about the name of the group and the classes conducted. I shared that our Bhakti Sanga Japa Group has morning chanting, rmad-Bhgavatam and Chaitanya Bhgavata classes, and evening kids' classes for various age groups. He then asked about our audience reach; I explained that we have a YouTube reach of over 1,000 and about 50�60 regular live attendees.\nHe asked, �Who all are the speakers� I mentioned speakers and attendees from across the U.S., U.K., U.A.E., and India, including Pran Govind Prabhu. Pran Govind Prabhu added the names of several senior devotees like Chandramauli Maharaj and Chaitanya Charan Prabhu.\nPran Govind Prabhu recalled, �Maharaj, you came into a Bhakti Sanga class while Chandramauli Swami was speaking.�\nMaharaj chuckled and said, �I invaded into his class; I came to see him and sat next to him and joined the class.�\nWe told him joyfully, �Yes, Maharaj! That was a highlight for us�we took screenshots and celebrated your darshan, saying Guru Maharaj came to Bhakti Sanga!�\nSoon, Maharaj requested Pran Govind Prabhu�s son to bring two full plates of prasadam. Maharaj said, �Bring nice full plates, not something small.�\nAs more devotees noticed Maharaj's presence, they started coming over. Meanwhile, Pran Govind Prabhu told us we must take pictures, and he started taking pictures of our meeting under the tree!\nAs devotees joined in, they also took pictures with him. Guru Maharaj introduced us to them, saying, �These two wonderful ladies came all the way to see me, so I came to meet them.�\nI profusely thanked Pran Govind Prabhu for arranging this wonderful meeting. The brahmachari I had first met later came over with an arati plate. I introduced him to Maharaj, saying he was instrumental in making this meeting happen. The brahmachari smiled and said, �Of course�she�s my Bhakti-str teacher.� I was surprised to learn that he was Akshar Prabhu, a sincere student from our classes.\nAs Pran Govind Prabhu�s son was bringing the plates, Maharaj remarked, �This must be very precious and special; look at the way he is carrying the plates with delicate care.� Later, Maharaj said, �I will give it to them,� and handed them to us with loving care. As we dropped our water bottles trying to accept the plates, others chuckled and said, �Look! Water bottles are on the ground,� and Pran Govind Prabhu said, �Looks like their hands are full!�\nMaharaj asked, �Are you staying tonight�\nRevathy and I replied, �We�ll check with the hotel front desk. Maybe we�ll return tonight if possible.�\nMaharaj said firmly, �First, eat nicely. Then rest well at the hotel and drive back tomorrow after proper rest.�\nWe immediately agreed; it was our spiritual master�s order!\nMaharaj smiled, walked back to his car, and we stood watching until it disappeared from view.\nIt was the most unforgettable moment of our lives. Every bite of prasadam tasted like nectar�Mahaprasad from the hands of a pure devotee. That night, we barely slept, our hearts full.\nThe next day, we returned to Atlanta�forever transformed.\nJaya Srila Gurudev!\n________________________________________\nLessons:\nRevathy reflected: �If there is one thing to deeply imbibe from Guru Maharaj, it is his extraordinary humility.�\nI reflected: Just as Lord Rama ran to receive Vibhishan with apologies for making him wait in the sky, our Guru Maharaj�more compassionate than even the Supreme Lord�crossed all obstacles to give mercy to fallen souls like us.\nThe Varha-Charama loka declares that the Lord never forgets His devotees, even if they forget Him. So too, our spiritual master remembers and acknowledges every single soul.\nGuru Maharaj not only speaks of humility in every class�he lives it. In every step, every gesture, every word.\n________________________________________\n\nP.S. - Revathy is now initiated as Revati Priti devi dasi by Guru Maharaj."

Despite years of practice, I still find so many unwanted desires and impurities residing within my heart. I often feel discouraged, realizing how far I am from the standard of pure devotion. Yet, the scriptures and saints declare that by the blessings of the spiritual master, even a dumb man can speak eloquently, and a lame man can cross mountains. You have always demonstrated this truth through your own life�living up to the expectations of your Guru Maharaj and empowering countless souls to perform acts of devotion that are far beyond their natural capacity.\n\nGuru Maharaj, you have shown through your personal example how to endeavor practically in every sphere of life�spiritual and material�always keeping Krishna at the center. Your determination, steadiness, and compassion are a living inspiration. However, I must confess that my own determination is often weak.

At times, I feel tired and helpless, but remembering your tireless example rekindles my hope. It reminds me that through your mercy, even my faltering steps can be steadied, and even my weakest efforts can find meaning in Krishna�s service.\n\nTherefore, my only prayer is that you kindly shower your causeless mercy upon me and my family. Please help me remain steady in my sadhana, responsible in my duties, and sincere in my service to the devotees.

What more need I say You are eternally everything to me. You are everything I have searched for in this world.\nThank you for accepting me as your disciple, Gurumaharaj. Thank you very much!\nAfter this year�s Krtik Yatra at Govardhan, I further visited Jagannath Puri for the first time and also in Kolkata � places of rla Prabhupda's schools, birthplace, and the Ultadanga Road. Without your mercy, I would not have visited that historically most significant place where rla Prabhupda met HH Bhaktisiddhnta Sarasvat hkura for the first time.\nI wanted to share a realization I got from there. When I was kneeling in front of HH Bhaktisiddhnta Sarasvat hkura's picture on his bed, I was strongly praying to be qualified to preach and assist you and rla Prabhupda in your mission. I felt very unqualified and helpless in my attempts and desires.\nA few minutes later, a brahmacr welcomed us and was telling us about this place. After I shared my prayers with him, he mentioned that HG Jananivs Prabhu said that the best way of preaching is if we maintain purity!\nIt made a deep impression in my heart receiving this instruction on the rooftop of that very birthplace of ISKCON. rla Prabhupda and you conquered everyone�s heart by your purity � your pure faith in the Lord and the holy names.\nLater in the week, I traveled further to Mypur and read in the rmad-Bhgavatam this beautiful verse which fully reminded me of you. Krishna instructs Uddhava:\n\nSB 11.7.44\nO King, a saintly person is just like water because he is free from all contamination, gentle by nature, and by speaking creates a beautiful vibration like that of flowing water. Just by seeing, touching or hearing such a saintly person, the living entity is purified, just as one is cleansed by contact with pure water. Thus a saintly person, just like a holy place, purifies all those who contact him because he always chants the glories of the Lord.\nPurport:\nThe words ap mitram, �just like water,� can also be read as aghn mitram, which means that a saintly person purifies all living entities by accepting them as mitram, or his personal friends, and saves them from their sinful reactions (aght).\nA saintly person, however, is like pure water, free from all contamination and capable of purifying all things. Just as pure water is transparent, a saintly person transparently manifests the Personality of Godhead within his heart. Such love of Godhead is the reservoir of all happiness.\nWater makes a most pleasing vibration as it flows and cascades, and similarly the sound vibration of the Lord�s pure devotee, who is saturated with the glories of the Lord, is most charming and beautiful.\n\nThis verse is so beautiful. Especially this part:\nA saintly person purifies all living entities by accepting them as mitram, or his personal friends, and saves them from their sinful reactions...\nAnd:\nJust as pure water is transparent, a saintly person transparently manifests the Personality of Godhead within his heart...\nDuring the Krtik Yatra lectures of yours, you spoke exactly like it is described in this verse. You calibrate the consciousness back to one�s own nature of the soul � being an eternal servant of Krishna.\nI am inspired and overwhelmed by how deeply you sacrificed your life towards God and how intense your love is for rla Prabhupda.\nOn rla Prabhupda's disappearance day, the couple who were HH Bhakti Trtha Swami's disciples shared a memory of him that deeply touched my heart and I am still meditating on that.\nThe Prabhu once asked HH Bhakti Trtha Swami that people are misusing him, and Maharaja's answer was:\n\"I want to get used by everyone to uplift the consciousness. I don't care if they use me. In whatever way it works for the mission.\"\nThis same mood I see within you as well, and I desire to love God and all living beings in the same mood, with the same love, with the same urgency.\nI read in the SB 11.2.52 purport:\nJust as one becomes very much concerned about any pain in one�s own body, one should be concerned with bringing the conditioned souls to the platform of devotional service so that all of their suffering will be banished forever.\nThis is what I learned from you � to keep this mood in my forefront, to be a selfless servant of everyone and try to be an instrument of God's love.\n\nMay my body become the asana of you.\nMy senses the lamps of the temple of you.\nMy desires the joy of your service, and my dedication a camara waving behind you.\n\nYour Servant of Your Servants,\nJhulan Lila Devi Dasi"

Please accept my humble obeisances, all glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nCongratulations on reaching this milestone appearance day, 75 years in your current body, which, when I see you, I realize that you are actually spirit and not matter.\n\nWhat you have achieved for Srila Prabhupada's mission, not many individuals would have been able to do. The list is endless. The highlighted achievements for me include the Eco Village and the Bhakti Centre in New York. Such ventures, from thought process to achievement, make me realize Srila Prabhupada empowered you from onset to the end. You must feel proud spiritually for your achievements.\n\nThe other highlight I recall is the annual yatras, Maharaj, that you have instigated. Beginning from a modest number of your devotees, you took them around the holy places pre-2002, which was the first one I attended. And since then, I have almost attended every one up to the very latest Govardhan yatra 2025, which was probably one of the largest congregations of devotees I have seen.\n\nDearest Maharaj, I would like to end by expressing my sincere gratitude for initiating me into Srila Prabhupada's family on July 31st, 2005. You changed my name from Kishore Rana to Krishna Kishore Dasa. This is our 20th anniversary, also a milestone. Thank you so much, Maharaj.\n\nHave a great day, and I remain\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nKrishna Kishore Dasa"

    "Your Offering": "Dearest His Holiness Radhanath Swami,\nLord Chaitanya descended out of His causeless mercy\nTo bestow what no incarnation had offered before to all the unworthy�\nThe most elevated mellow of conjugal love,\nThe love of the gops which is selfless, true love.\nYet I would not know Lord Chaitanya if it wasn�t for you.\nYou gave me access to His teachings of the highest truth.\nYou are Lord Chaitanya�s representative, resplendent with the radiance of molten gold,\nAnd you are my spiritual master who has removed my blindfold,\nSo my eyes can behold the original spiritual master Lord Nitynanda so perfect.\nYou�ve delivered me to Their feet so I can offer Them loving respect.\nUnless one is favored by a pure devotee, they cannot attain Krishna Bhakti.\nI have only been saved from material existence by your akti.\nThe only way to not succumb to our lower nature is to take full shelter of pure devotees�\nOtherwise our material senses can be carried away by the breeze.\nYou are such a liberated Vaiava, but you are more than that.\nBhakti Charu Mahrja said you are an eternally liberated associate of the Lord, and that is a fact.\nHe said you have descended to assist rla Prabhupda in his divine mission,\nAnd rla Prabhupda recognized you at the Bombay pandal and gave you permission\nTo touch his feet and told you to sit with him on the stage.\nYou have descended to help him liberate all of us from our material cage.\nThe story of Ghanashyam Baba in The Journey Home reveals\nOne of your most primary teachings and important appeals:\n�td api suncena� � more humble than a blade of grass.\nYou have taught us to imbibe this verse as our first test in class.\nWe have to become more tolerant than a tree\nIf we want to be a devotee and have the key\nTo chant Hare Krishna constantly � we need to wear this verse around our neck\nAnd know that in Krishna�s creation we are but a tiny speck.\nYou say:\n\n�A humble heart is one that gives no resistance to the natural flow of grace,\nIt is similar to how small we feel in relation to the ocean when we stand in that beautiful place.�\n\nYou teach us that:\n\n�We all have infinite importance because God loves each of us,\nAnd we only need to be grateful for His love� and decide to discuss\nHis loving pastimes and glories and chant His Name,\nAnd live in harmony with His will, making that our life�s aim.\n\nA tree bears the sun in the summer and gives its shade.\nYou have sacrificed more for us, and your love will never fade.\nYou want us to respect others and never desire to be respected�\nI see this teaching you, yourself, have perfected.\nEverywhere you go in the world, people praise you,\nBut every day you see yourself as an insignificant servant of Prabhupda � that is your view.\nYou have personally instructed us all in your lectures, shedding gallons of blood,\nAnd listening to your lectures inundates my heart with a transcendental flood.\nYou have personally instructed all of us to sincerely chant our sixteen rounds.\nAt initiation, you explained that the Holy Name purifies us � whether pure or impure backgrounds.\nYou have personally instructed all of us to follow the four regulative principles strictly.\nPrabhupda said doing so will give us transcendental victory.\nYou have instructed all of us to serve Prabhupda�s mission as the servant of the servant.\nTo follow this instruction in my heart is a desire so fervent.\nPrabhupda told us we can please him by how we cooperate�\nThat is the mood you have created in all of your projects, and that is why they are great.\nYou wanted to live in Vndvana your whole life and serve,\nBut your visa expired, and in America you saw Prabhupda and observed\nPrabhupda saying we can realize Vndvana by serving the spiritual master�s mission�\nAnd you decided to give up your life in Vndvana ambition.\nYou surrendered to Prabhupda and selflessly served at New Vndvana,\nAnd it was so many years until you went back to India and Vndvana.\nBut Vndvana was always in your heart, and you wanted to do good\nFor India�s people, and you remembered at the border you had said you would.\nNow look at all you have done!\nMidday meals, Bhaktivedanta Hospital, and Barsana Eye Camps take care of everyone.\nThe Chowpatty temple has won the hearts of everyone in the world.\nGovardhan Eco Village is Vndvana manifesting from your heart to give us the spiritual world.\nYou have given pure Vndvana in a way that new Westerners can relate.\nThese Westerners don�t know that coming to GEV leads to pure devotion as their fortunate fate.\nKrishna has personally told you how He wants you to do all of these things.\nOne time you answered my question in a way that pulled my heartstrings.\nI asked:\n\n�When we are in separation from you and praying to you, do you know\nHow much we are trying to love you although we have so much to grow�\n\nYou replied:\n\n�Krishna knows everything, that is so,\nBut He tells me always what He wants me to know.�\n\nI asked you:\n\n�When we get back to the spiritual world, will we remember who we all were here�\nYou said:\n�We will, but only the good things from our together years.�\n\nI pray to serve you in this world and the spiritual world eternally.\nI want to serve you with all my heart � both externally and internally.\nI will never know the mind or the plan of you, the pure devotee,\nBut I pray that you reveal what you desire of me.\nYou told me in Alachua that to serve rla Prabhupda�s mission is your life project,\nAnd wherever I serve his mission, I am serving you and your project.\nBut I constantly sob in tears of separation,\nSo I pray you can live in my heart with no cessation.\nI pray you can use me as your puppet to assist you in your service to rla Prabhupda\nAnd make me beat like your mdaga.\nPlease make me dance as you wish me to dance�\nThen maybe someday I�ll receive your pleased side-long glance.\nI beg you to cleanse me of my pride and selfish desire\nSo I can contribute to ISKCON�s transcendental choir.\nI pray that by your mercy I realize my own insignificance\nAnd make my only desire and joy in life your happiness.\nI pray I can hear your desire in the innermost chamber of my heart\nAnd that you make my life your piece of art.\nI pray to be the servant of the servant of your servants as my only endeavor�\nThis is my only chance to serve Rdh and Krishna forever.\n\nYour servant,\nChampakalata Sakhi devi dasi"

The devotees gave me the opportunity to serve dinner prasadam to you. I was waiting in the hall while you were refreshing after your flight journey. When you came down the stairs, we both looked at each other. As you smiled at me, I moved towards you, and you hugged me. This truly showed how merciful you are to the most fallen souls.\n\nWhile Srila Prabhupada�s Lilamrita gave me the conviction to remain in the Krishna consciousness movement, your Journey Home inspired me to take initiation from you.\n\nIf it were not for you and Srila Prabhupada, I would have surely lived a most sinful life. Because of your mercy, I am now blessed to serve as a coordinator for the children�s program of ISKCON Chennai, conducting classes for adults at the temple, and leading school preaching activities at ECR under the guidance of HG Tarini Radha Mataji and the Temple Management Team.

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nI want to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for picking me up from the horrible depths of a life of sense gratification, and giving me shelter at Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Mandir. The community is a surreal oasis, a spiritual world, where sincere devotees who love you assist you in your service to Their Lordships, Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, Srila Prabhupada, and their devotees. And these devotees truly carry your compassion in their hearts. My profuse thanks to you for giving me shelter of Vaishnavas who perfectly imbibe your mood and mission; your love and loyalty to Srila Prabhupada; and your devotion and dedication to the sacred Brahma Madhva Gaudiya Parampara.\nToday, I would like to particularly thank you for the series of lectures you gave last year during the initiation festivals that we had in Mumbai, Nasik, Kolhapur, and Belgaum. I heard them as sincerely and attentively as possible and drew many important lessons for my own spiritual life. I would like to thank you for the same. The most important lesson I learned from your heartfelt instructions during these ceremonies, which I would like to particularly meditate on today on your 75th Vyasa Puja, is as follows:\n�All attractions of this world not only pale in comparison to the attractiveness of Krishna, but also ultimately come from an insignificant portion of Krishna�s splendor. Through occasions like initiation ceremonies, Krishna is beckoning us to come to Him and He has mercifully sent the parampara to help us come to Him.�\nWhen I heard this from you, I knew instantly that you were sent by Krishna, for you were on your way to the Himalayas, but inconceivably you got off the train at a station and then realized it was Mathura Junction, and that day happened to be Krishna�s appearance day. This was ordained by Krishna Himself�that you visit His birthplace on His birthday. Even at Patna, when you were hearing Ram katha from Ramsevak Swami, his disciple was translating the Hindi talk in English for you, but he only kept narrating the Damodar lila to you daily. Puzzled, you asked him why he repeated the same story daily while you could hear words like Rama, Sita, Hanuman etc. in the talks of Ramsevak Swami. The disciple humbly said that his guru had told him that Lord Rama had appeared to him in a dream and told him that you are a devotee of Krishna and you should hear Krishna katha. Unfortunately, the disciple didn�t know any other pastime other than Damodar Lila, so he daily spoke the same story to you while Ramsevak Swami was speaking Ramayana daily. This was another confirmation that you are especially dear to Krishna.\nOnce, at Kumbh Mela, in January 2000, I saw a sophisticated CEO challenge you at the preaching tent. He repeatedly asked you why you left Judaism to embrace Hinduism when all religions essentially teach the same thing. You offered a diplomatic answer at first, saying how love of God is the message of all faiths; and perfection can be attained by any religious system. Instead of placating him, this agitated him more and he persisted with his challenge. Finally, when you realized that his questioning was pointed and specific, and there was no way you could avoid answering the truth, you humbly bowed your head and then softly, yet confidently, looking straight into his eyes, said, �I accepted Krishna consciousness because Krishna attracted my heart like nobody and nothing else.�\nAll these incidents confirm that you are an eternal associate of Krishna, and sent by Krishna to save us from material life, and take us back to Him.\nIn one of the mid-1990s lectures you gave to the fledgling congregation at Nigdi, you spoke the Brahmana wives pastime where the simple women ran, overcoming all obstacles and breaking all social barriers, to offer all the foodstuffs to Krishna and Balarama. At one point in the class, you paused and slowly said that just like Krishna sent the boys to the brahmanas, and then to their wives to ask for food, similarly, you have been sent by Krishna and Srila Prabhupada to ask them to offer their �food� (life) to Krishna. You said with loving compassion that you are sincerely going to offer them to Srila Prabhupada and Krishna. Then, you requested all of us to not be like the proud and reluctant brahmanas but the simple and surrendered wives of the brahmanas.\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your appearance day, I wish to repeatedly remember how you are most dear to Krishna and how you have been mercifully sent by Krishna to ask us to offer our lives to Krishna.\nToday, I wish to offer all that I have to you, for pleasing you, for I know you are faithfully serving Srila Prabhupada and Krishna�s orders of delivering the conditioned souls, who are rotting in this bizarre material world.\nDear Guru Maharaj, please take pity on me and pick me up from the abyss of material life and accept my meager offerings made in a feeble voice. Please accept me and give me a chance to redeem myself and come back to Krishna in this one lifetime.\nThank you again\nAspiring to be the servant of your servants\nVraja Bihari Dasa"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nWhen I heard you say once, \"All glories to Guru and Gauranga means nothing left for us, no glory for ourselves,\" I was very moved. That goal is a spiritual setpoint, a mark to achieve a particular level of humility. But often, when agitated, I am unable to remember this and many teachings of yours, being a conditioned soul. Last year, my exams went fine by your grace, but I was battered throughout the year. Many anarthas loomed over me again and again, pulling me down like a screeching demon. Only your grace and the gift of Bhakti kept me going. When I was tired, fallen, struggling with my sobriety attempts, your statement, \"There is no disqualification for Bhakti,\" reminded me that no matter how fallen I may be, no matter how far down the wrong road I have gone, there is still hope to return. I have not been disqualified.\n\nThis year, on Srila Prabhupada's appearance day, I heard for the first time the beautiful song offering \"Je subh diner aradhana.\" It was so heartfelt, and my heart melted on the line \"jeevan yuddhe parajita.\" Because that's true.

That life is going to be more busy, more hard, and more challenging. But it is also going to be one with more service opportunities. Please bless me, Maharaja, so that I may continue steadfast on this path of surrender and continue being strong in my vows to you.\n\nGuru Maharaja, I do not want to ask any questions in this offering of mine. Your Vyasa Puja is a day of celebration, and I don't want to bother you, Maharaja, with my questions. I'm sure you'll enlighten me about those questions during my prayers and meditation. I'm very happy, Maharaja, that I found your shelter. I want to make you happy. And I think nothing can make you happier than me serving devotees.\n\nTherefore, I have started working on a monthly magazine. So far, I have published three issues on Scribd, by the name \"This War of Mine.\" I've also put it on Telegram: https://t.me/twomagazine. First, I used to put my own thoughts and articles in it, but by your mercy, I understood that's a flawed practice. From editions two and onwards, I have started putting articles that I've heard or read from other senior devotees. This way, my pride remains in check, and I get to serve the devotees. I've also taken up the work of dubbing the eleven DVDs of \"Following Prabhupada\" in Hindi language and then uploading them on YouTube. So far, I've translated and rendered about 1.5 hours of the first DVD. It is an added pleasure to serve patients who show up in my hospital, where I'm posted.\n\nI look forward to serving you, Maharaja, for all my life and beyond. Please always keep me under the shelter of your lotus feet. I also look forward to the acceptance of my candidature as a Harinam Diksha applicant in your shelter. Please formally initiate me whenever you think I am ready for it. I will always be standing in your service, ready for any instruction you give me. Please bless me, Maharaja.\n\nPranam, Maharaja.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada."

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj, please accept my humble obeisances in the dust of Your lotus feet! All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n\nWhile practicing devotional service, from time to time I�m looking back & recalling my first meeting with You, Guru Maharaj. When I was listening to Your first lecture in Russia, while You were talking about service to the Vaishnavas, I was feeling � that�s it! That�s what I was looking for all my life. & somebody from inside told me quite strongly � this is your Guru! Although I was initiated already by another person. I�m sure it was Krishna, who else can do it! & during listening to so many of Your classes I had the same feeling � Who else but Krishna can say something so exact, sharp & so close to my heart! It is what I was feeling all my life but couldn�t express myself. Like recently I�ve read one of Your constant sayings: �All virtues have their origin in gratitude�. I started to contemplate: Because gratitude means to recognize what was done for me by somebody else & finally by Krishna as origin of everything, that means that as soon I understood it I�m in connection with Krishna, Who is the source of all good qualities. As soon as one has connection with Krishna, he has all the good qualities. For You it�s not just a theory, Guru Maharaj, I know it for sure. & while contemplating further on this I could understand that this is practically only experience for me of Krishna�s presence in my life & the way to connect with Him. Like recently my mother left her body. All the time, from my first days in ISKCON, she was telling me: �Son, when you leave this� Of course, she had no inclination to spiritual life at all. On the contrary, she was addicted to all the sins possible! & I could clearly understand � I can do nothing about it, except feeding her prasadam! But due to Krishna�s & Your mercy, her last word was �Krishna�! She died as a Vaishnavi. & not only this, but she was cremated (& this is itself quite difficult to do, considering our family traditions) & her ashes were put into Yamuna! The more I live, the more I have the feeling � Krishna, Srila Prabhupada & You, Guru Maharaj are my best friend. Not in plural, because You are one in some sense (Guru is sakshad Hari). You all are always with me! I�m feeling that You are one team & while I�m thinking of one of You, then immediately I�m remembering all of You. So, again & again I�m feeling � You are Krishna�s mercy on me, Guru Maharaj. Unfortunately, this feeling is not lasting long & my life again & again becomes ordinary. I understand, yes, it�s because I have no real taste to serve Your lotus feet � rati, which is not coming soon, because it�s Uttama gati � highest perfection of a disciple�s life. But by Your mercy I know the way! I should just strictly follow Your divine instructions & moreover, to strive to help You in fulfilling Srila Prabhupada�s mission. Then I�ll be tuned to Krishna�s wave & feel Him & You constantly. I still can�t believe that my empty & stupid life came to an end & I can devote all my life to the service to Srila Prabhupada�s & Your lotus feet! So, on this most auspicious day I�m praying to You to help me, in spite of all my impurities & hard egotism, to keep strongly in my heart Your Divine Lotus Feet, which means Your Divine instructions & strictly follow this great mercy of the Lord. I�m sure this is the only way to Krishna.\n\nAspiring to become Your real disciple,\nSri Gourahari Das."

An acharya is one who teaches practically from his *achar*. And you are the crest jewel example of this. Gurudev, in every lecture, you stress the importance of chanting holy names, serving Vaishnavas in the mood of servant of servant of servant, and developing humility. And you personally teach by your own example. Dear Gurudev, you are so humble that you never look for any recognition and glorification. Outside people hanker so much for recognition, doing all sorts of crazy things to get viral, to get famous. But advanced devotees like you always look for serving maximum with minimum limelight. I'm very, very deeply touched by this one quality of you, which is also seen in many of Srila Prabhupada's disciples: that everyone wants to just serve together just to please SRILA PRABHUPADA with no personal ambition. It's my greatest fortune to witness personalities like you in my lifetime. Because the only place where I have heard of such personalities is in scriptures like *Chaitanya Charitamrita* and *Srimad Bhagavatam*. Even in this age, when most people just retire to enjoy the fruit of their lifetime's hard work, although they're unable to do so properly because of their failing health, Gurudev, you are still extending more and more and more. Even when you take care of your health, you do it purely out of a service mood: \"How can I serve Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas more and more with this body\" Generally, when someone does service which attracts the mercy of Mahabhagavats, then they get the mercy and blessings. But persons like me are *kripana* who don't even cry for mercy, although they are in most need of mercy. Even though I haven't done anything good which can attract your heart and mercy, save for doing all nonsense things, still you have accepted me. Your lectures are a radar for me. In your lecture, you said that initiation is the serious beginning responsibility of a *sadhaka*. While I feel unworthy to be called your disciple, but whatever I can do in the present situation as a responsible disciple of such an exalted spiritual master as you. I pray at your lotus feet that please never give up on me. Please chastise me, punish me, whenever I'm wrong, but never reject me. I'm always dependent on you. I seek your mercy and blessings that I become a better devotee, one who only wants to serve Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas and nothing else.\n\nInsignificant servant of your servants,\nShyam Jivan Das"

They all consoled me and took all necessary steps, right from informing others, keeping the body in the cold room, for the next day's funeral arrangements, kirtan party, bringing maha garland, condolence meeting, all days' prasadam for me and my relatives, and so on.\nLater on, I was thinking how all these events went so smoothly without my relatives. Then I realized that it was because of Srila Prabhupada, who had built a house where the whole world can live with love and concern.\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for accepting me as your disciple and allowing me to live with such a wonderful family of Srila Prabhupada.\nYours aspiring disciple,\nJivanand Das\nPune NVCC"

Still, I wish to offer a few words as an expression of my gratitude, knowing that whatever sincerity I have is a gift from you alone.\nYou have taught us that every circumstance in life � whether joyous or painful � can become an opportunity to deepen our relationship with Krishna. When I look at my own journey, I can see that every step of progress I have made, every spark of faith or desire for service, has come solely through your compassion. Even my awareness of how dependent I am on your mercy is itself your mercy.\nLately, I realize more deeply your presence manifests through the devotees who guide us locally. The teachings of His Grace the late Tapas Prabhu continue to sustain the Maha Mantra Lab, a small program we run with the family here in Cochabamba (Bolivia - South America). How beautiful it has been to know that you accompanied him in his last glorious days of service in our beloved ISKCON Stockholm community.\nAlso, the guidance and association of His Grace Brajasundara Pr. (from IBMV Vrindavana) and Her Grace Premamayi Devi (TKG) that is always calling us to visit her in the Holy Dham. The support, protection, and affectionate presence of His Holiness Dhanvantari Swami and his disciples are also your kindness reaching us. Through all of them and all other ik gurus that kindly instruct us and give us their association, I can receive your guidance and care, reminding me that your mercy flows in so many forms and directions, touching every heart � even of a worm such as my own � and that the great compassion of rla Prabhupda in giving us ISKCON to meet and serve together has no parallel in the three worlds.\nThrough your example, Maharaj, I am learning the importance of respecting every living being, the power of the Holy Name, the meaning of service to others as a service to You. Although I often struggle to approach devotional life with humility and gratitude, and to follow your instructions properly, I find solace in your patience and kindness. You continue to reach out to us, even when we are lost in forgetfulness, reminding us that Krishna never abandons His children. That message alone sustains me. In your words and actions, I feel the presence of rla Prabhupda�s love, and it gives me irrefutable proof that the process of bhakti is real, alive, and ever-fresh.\nMaharaj, thank you for everything. I pray to remain under the shadow of your lotus feet, life after life, trying to make conscious decisions to make my heart gradually a suitable place for r r Rdh and Krishna to reside.\nThank you for everything, most dear beloved Master, on the auspicious day of your appearance.\nGovindanandini dd."

All glories unto you.\nIt is that time of the year, a joyous occasion for all of us, and even more so this year, as this year marks the 75th year of your divine appearance in this material world. You were asked what would be the best gift that your disciples can give you for your birthday, and you mentioned these 5 points:\n\n1. Go deep into hearing, chanting, and service.\n2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Krishna.\n3. Stand together as a community.\n4. Practice enthusiasm to share Bhakti and Krishna Consciousness.\n5. Bhakti is not about quantity, but it is all about pleasing Guru and Krishna. Never compromise quality for quantity and infuse all your quality into your quantity.\n\n\"This, Maharaj said, would be my answer, be it my 25th birthday, 50th birthday, or 75th birthday.\" As a disciple, we will strive to cultivate all the above-mentioned points, particularly the first one, that of going deep into hearing and chanting of the holy name of Krishna and service, as 99% of our spiritual advancement depends on chanting. In all your lectures at the recent Kartik yatra in Govardhan Dhaam, you stressed the importance of taking shelter of the Holy name in all situations. You mentioned that we will be empowered in our service to the degree we are absorbed in chanting the holy names of the Lord. This chanting bathes our heart and awakens dormant love of God in our heart, and this will please the Lord. Although we are unqualified and have unlimited shortcomings and anarthas, it is only by your mercy that we have been engaged in the service of Their Lordships, and on this most auspicious day of your Vyasa Puja, we humbly pray at your lotus feet to always keep us in your divine shelter and empower us so that we continue to hear and chant the Holy names of the Lord sincerely, seriously, and without ulterior motives, so that we continue to render unconditional, loving service unto Sri Sri Radha Londonisvara and Their devotees in the mood of humble servant of the servant, and thereby please you and Krishna.\n\nPraying sincerely for your good health.\n\nYour servant,\nParam Sundari devi dasi (London � UK)"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna, Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nDandavat pranams.\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your 75th appearance day, I find myself at a loss for words, unsure where to begin or how to fully express my feelings. There is so much I wish to convey, and the list could go on endlessly. I am deeply grateful for everything you have done for me, my family, the ISKCON movement, and countless devotees around the world. You have become a beacon of hope for so many, serving as a shining, living example of a true and genuine follower of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada�firmly rooted in the blossoming devotee tree of his spiritual legacy, as a radiant branch of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu�s tree of love.\nYour personal association, inspiring lectures, and exemplary actions�especially in how you interact with devotees and others�are truly remarkable. You speak exactly what others need to hear, connecting heart to heart with compassion, empathy, and sensitivity. People are naturally drawn to your personality, as you embody and radiate the all-attractive nature of Krishna.\nFrom my own interactions with you, as well as the experiences of others, I have realized that you are a bona fide ambassador of the great mahajans, carrying Krishna within your heart. It feels as though you are directly connected to the Supersoul, speaking and acting in perfect harmony with divine guidance. Your thoughts, words, and actions are perfectly synchronized, reflecting the mood and consciousness of Srimati Radharani�ever compassionate, always appreciative, seeing only the good in others, and constantly encouraging everyone. You never write anyone off, but instead offer chance after chance for improvement. The way you truly \"walk the talk\" brings everyone closer to the loving Divine Couple, following the directions of the Goswamis in pleasing service to Mahaprabhu.\nYour yatras reverberate with the mercy and compassion of Sri Nityananda Mahaprabhu. The way you guide everyone to the Dham allows us to truly see and experience the spiritual world, its divine activities, and the lilas of the Divine Couple�through your vision and presence, you become a window for us to witness what you see, as you embody compassion for countless souls and for Krishna Himself.\nThe many projects you have initiated�temples, new centers, farm communities, hospitals, eye camps, and more�are beautiful expressions of your love and dedication to your Guru Maharaj. Through these endeavors, you are setting new heights and boundaries, inspiring others to follow in your illustrious footsteps.\nIt is truly amazing, Maharaj, how you have dedicated your entire life as an Akhanda Brahmachari, like Bhishma Dev, never deviating from love and service to the mission of your Gurudeva. The example you set is extraordinary and will inspire generations to come. Though it may take me many lifetimes to follow in your footsteps, with your help and mercy, I pray that you hold me close so I may walk behind you. Perhaps one day, I will be able to do something that sincerely, selflessly, and without ulterior motives, pleases you.\nYour ever-smiling face, combined with a lion-like sobriety while serving devotees and thunderous determination in carrying forward the mission, is truly remarkable. You possess an ever-accommodating nature and a heart as soft as butter when dealing with devotees, yet you are uncompromising and disciplined with yourself, steadfast in your sadhana and principles. Your selfless giving, without expecting anything in return except the opportunity to serve, beautifully embodies the Acintya Bheda Abheda Tattva of Mahaprabhu�the sweet and loving contradictions that harmonize shastra, tattva, and rasa as illustrious ornaments.\nThese qualities attract the mood and mercy of the previous acharyas, offering hope, purpose, direction, and meaning to the lives of conditioned souls, and providing a path for them to stay and grow in spiritual life. How do you achieve this Perhaps, with your blessings, I may one day understand a little and carry your mood as your servant of the servant.\nYou never speak of your own achievements as service to your Guru; yet, like the fragrance of a flower that cannot be hidden, your accomplishments naturally shine forth. Krishna Himself reveals you and your services to the world, showcasing your greatness even as you choose to remain humble and in the background. People from all over the world are drawn to you, just as honeybees are irresistibly attracted to nectar.\nI observe that your own godbrothers and godsisters regard you as a beacon of hope�a true preceptor and representative of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The way you interact with them, and the loving reciprocation you share, reminds me of the affectionate exchanges in Gaura Lila between Mahaprabhu and His intimate devotees. It is as if the Srimad Bhagavatam is coming to life through your actions. Despite your busy schedule, you always make time for your godbrothers and godsisters, while also maintaining a perfect balance in caring for your own disciples and the disciples of other gurus.\nMany devotees share their personal observations, interactions, and experiences with you across various situations and circumstances. The common thread in all these accounts is your unwavering consistency�always grateful, humble, and eager to serve, without any conditions, reservations, or limitations.\nOn a personal level, my interactions with you during your visits to Columbus�whether staying at our home, driving you locally, or going out for walks�are cherished memories that I will relish for the rest of my life. These moments are truly your causeless mercy, which I feel undeserving of, yet I continually hanker for them, as they keep me alive on the path of Bhakti, inspiring me to remain enthusiastic, grateful, and determined to continue, no matter what challenges arise. Your prayers for our family (Vrajabhakti, Narahari Rupa, and Parikshith), and your kind support during times of need, though we may not deserve them, are like a lighthouse guiding our boat through the storms of life.\nI pray to Lord Narasimha Deva for your health and physical well-being, asking Him to grant you a long, healthy life so that you may continue to save and guide countless souls who are searching for Krishna, yearning to advance on the path of Bhakti, and struggling for strength, hope, and direction to make their lives meaningful.\nMaharaj, I am eternally grateful to you. No matter what I do, I can never repay you for all that you have given me, though I do not deserve it. Please bless me so that I may always remain connected to you and your mission, stay steadfast on the path of Bhakti, and continue to serve you in a way that pleases you, no matter what challenges arise.\nThank you very much.\nYour servant of servant,\nNaveen Krishna Das\nISKCON Columbus\nBoard of Directors and Temple Management"

All glories, all glories to You, rla Prabhupda and Gaurga.\nWishing you a very happy and joyful 75th appearance day and Vysa Pj. Thank you for appearing in this world, to extend Your causeless mercy to inspire and show us the real home, and real path to our supreme beloved Lord Krishna.\nThe purity and loving compassion, combined with the boundless mercy of Your divine grace, envelops us like an endless wave of Your deep love when You deliver Krishna Kath. One such wave of love struck me profoundly when You narrated the appearance of Lord Krishna. The impact of that wave was so profound that I was swept away into the depths of Yamun, as Nanda Mahrja desperately searched for the drowning newborn Krishna. As You narrated, I was immersed in the pastimes. That day, my heart clearly guided me to seek shelter in this divine personality. Thank You for sending that wave of love and carrying me under the wave of Your boundless mercy and divine affection, dear Guru Mahrja. I was drowning in material suffering, unaware that I was trapped in an unimaginable and intricate web of inter-coiled miseries.\nSince then, dear Gurudeva, it is only Your words that have been working for me, and nothing else. I have been tossed from one wave of suffering to another, not even knowing that I am suffering, but this time, I am beginning to realize that I am indeed experiencing suffering.\nYour classes have the remarkable ability to uncover deeply rooted material miseries and perform precise surgery. I can feel Your presence in everything. Some anarthas are so profound that hearing Your words has helped me understand that they are not favorable for the soul.\nAfter a series of oceanic tides splashing and tossing me, one day, Your v echoed, �To the degree you have expectations, to that degree you suffer when those expectations are not met.� I realized that we shouldn�t expect anything from anyone. This realization lifted me out of the suffering ocean and onto the surface of a beautiful island of detachment.\nWhile I was chanting, my restless mind wandered over incidents, inflicts, and pulled me back to the ocean of justification, blame, and victimization. One day, with Your love, Your v echoed again, this time sternly, �Stop your chanting. Go to the altar and pray to Lord Caitanya, Lord Rdh Madan Mohan for the well-being of the person who is coming and disturbing us while we are chanting.� As an innocent child, when I followed it, I was surprised. It took me back to a new beautiful island of forgiveness. This island is far superior to the one called detachment.\nBut wait, dear Gurudeva. Why does Your v echo again and again Why do You come to save me every time I pondered why You care so much about this wretched person like me. Each time You come, Your soothing balm of Your v, the breeze of Your glances, the soothing hugs when we meet, and the memorable interactions remind me of Lord Caitanya, who never leaves anyone�not just me, but all living entities.\nYou are that divine and magnanimous personality who touches simple people to celebrities. Your lectures are enough to spark a new revolution for challenged societies to return to Goloka.\nYour krtans are as powerful as Your v. They flood us with an overwhelming wave of love and affection.\nYour projects like annual Krtik Ytras, Ulta Dunga Junction, Govardhan Eco Village, Bhakti Center, and Bhaktivedanta Hospitals create beautiful islands for all types of people to immerse, refresh, be cured, and emerge in the bliss of feeling the love of Lord Krishna.\nAbove all, dear Gurudeva, as You said in Your v, anyone who comes to ytra can make tremendous progress in devotion, which would not have been possible even in millions of lifetimes. I am deeply grateful for the ytras that have allowed all of us to repair and redirect our focus on Lord Krishna.\nWhat can a humble, ordinary, and low-class person like me offer You, dear Mahrja I will only try and try to be an instrument of Your beloved mission of serving Your Spiritual Master. I will strive to follow and serve Your mission.\nOn this auspicious day, I pray to all the Vaiavas, rla Prabhupda, our cryas, a Goswms, r r Niti Gaura Chandra, Pa�ca-tattva, rman Mahprabhu, r r Rdh Madan Mohan, and r Lakm Narasiha Deva, r r Rdh Govinda Deva, and r r Rdh Gopintha to bestow upon You long life, good health, energy, and bliss in Krishna Prema, and may I eternally in some way serve You, dear Guru Mahrja.\nWith deep gratitude!\nYour insignificant beggar,\nAcyuta Kumra Dsa"

We see, through your example, how our consciousness can remain situated at the lotus feet of Sri Krsna and Srimati Radharani in all circumstances.\nYou are the personification of everything you preach�a perfect teacher who recognizes the various good qualities in every jiva and engages them in devotional service according to their svabhava.\nDear Guru Maharaj, on your auspicious appearance day, I sincerely pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji to bless you with the best of health so that you may continue inspiring and sharing the love of Sri Krsna and Srimati Radharani with innumerable jivas, helping them attain the ultimate goal of prema-bhakti.\nI pray to always serve you in all my lifetimes, as stated by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and exemplified by you�as the servant of the servant of the servant."

It shows the rat race for material happiness and reveals the truth of material happiness as illusory and temporary. Whenever I see this video, I think that most people in this world don't know that they are suffering. Some of them know that they are suffering, but for them, it is just an unavoidable part of life. And very few of them feel frustrated with suffering, but they don't know how to get out of it. And very, very few know that spirituality can help, but they get misdirected. And in all this, very, very, very few get the rarest opportunity to connect with the bonafide disciplic succession and get saved by substituting material happiness with spiritual happiness through service to the Lord and His devotees. In all this, I don't stand anywhere because I have got this opportunity not because of my inquisitiveness, but it's the rarest causeless mercy of yours that has saved me.\n\nIn one class, you were saying that Lord Gauranga gave mercy to the animals of Zarikhand forest, but the animals had to accept that mercy before they got it. After hearing this, I was questioned philosophically because, as per my tiny knowledge, animals don't have the capacity to accept or reject anything beyond their destiny. I asked this to HG Vilas Vardhan Prabhu at Govardhan. Prabhu told me that in such cases, the Lord also gives the capacity to accept the mercy with the mercy. Prabhu said that just like animals, we have to consider ourselves like animals who are unqualified but have been blessed with mercy, and in that mood, we shall pray to Lord Giriraj. When I heard this explanation, I was humbled and started reflecting that, actually, before coming to VOICE, I was just an animal, but by your mercy, through various devotees, I got the opportunity to save myself.\n\nSince the last Kartik Yatra at Shridham Mayapur, I was eagerly waiting for this year's Kartik Yatra. One thing I was convinced of was that as in Mayapur, I was not able to always remain conscious of the greatness of holy places, of holy dham, and pray properly there, so visiting holy places used to become a very mechanical activity for me. Hence, I was simply waiting to give my best to hear your classes. When you sang the disappearance song for Srila Prabhupad, you made me cry in gratitude and humility for some moments in my life.\n\nGurudev, I was hearing your glories from many devotees and was moved to understand what kind of mercy I have received. In various departments of Dham Darshan, there was a Crowd Care department, and as HG Achyut Mohan Prabhu mentioned that your mood of love and care is reflected in the whole Yatra, I had seen the word \"Crowd Control\" but not \"Crowd Care\" until now, anywhere. But for the first time, I saw this as a reflection of your mood.\n\nGurudev, your love and loyalty for Srila Prabhupad inspire me deeply. I remember hearing how you were attentive about which places in Prayag various pastimes of Srila Prabhupad had happened, and you told HG Achyut Mohan Prabhu to research it. You revived Ultadanga Junction at Kolkata as one of the most important places for ISKCON. You served Srila Prabhupad wholeheartedly at New Vrindavan and later created Vrindavan at Wada.\n\nGurudev, your Vani gives me true shelter and strength. I have not been able to do any tangible service to you, Gurudev. Whatever devotees say about me is not actually done by me. It is just the desire of devotees, the support of devotees, the push of devotees, done by devotees, and at the end, credited to me just out of their compassion. I am simply a fortunate fool who has been immensely blessed.\n\nGurudev, you know me in and out and how much degraded my consciousness is, but at Govardhan, while glorifying Srila Prabhupad, you said that \"Srila Prabhupad will never leave anyone even if one leaves Srila Prabhupad.\" Similar is the hope for me that You and Srila Prabhupad will never leave me. And my sincere prayers at your lotus feet are that I may never forget you and Srila Prabhupad and always remain grateful to all who have, who are, and who will help me in remaining Krishna Conscious.\n\ninsignificant servant of your servants"

All glories to you, Guru Maharaj.\n\nWhere can I begin How can anyone truly describe or glorify someone as wondrous as you Each time I have the fortune of being in your divine presence, words fail me; my heart overflows, yet my voice remains silent. And now, as I offer these few humble lines, I fear that same silence will embrace me again. Still, I shall try�like a tiny bee attempting to speak of the sweetness of a lotus whose nectar it can scarcely taste.\n\nAfter having so many wonderful years of your association at the Bhaktivedanta Manor, my move to Australia meant that our relationship continued only through v. At the age of sixteen, I joyfully transcribed your lectures, which became my compass in life. As I grew older, responsibilities with work and postgraduate studies consumed my time, and eight years passed without seeing you. Each time I did have your daran, my false ego was mercifully shattered to pieces. My inner desire�to be noticed, to be spoken to by you�was exactly what you never wanted in a disciple. It took three such encounters for me to finally realize how foolish I had been. Yet in each instance, you were so compassionate, teaching me profound lessons through those experiences. And when the day finally came when I no longer desired your attention, by your divine mercy, you gave it completely.\n\nThrough all the years of serving in separation, what always kept me grounded on the path of bhakti were your words and your example. You have touched not only my heart but the hearts of countless souls across the world through your humility, compassion, and deep love for your Godbrothers and Godsisters, and your complete surrender to Srila Prabhupada. Your affection for your spiritual family is so pure and inspiring. Though I may not have the opportunity to serve you personally, I know in my heart that what pleases you most is my sincere surrender to HG Vaisesika Prabhu and Mother Nirakula. They have been the greatest blessing in my life and in the lives of my family, especially my son, Vaish. With such selfless love, they have embraced us into the ISV community, always making sure we are spiritually cared for and meaningfully engaged in service�services I never imagined I could perform with such joy and gratitude.\n\nMoving to ISV was truly a turning point in my spiritual journey, for it brought me the rare blessing of being in your divine presence once again�after yet another eight long years of separation. (I am still wondering what the Lord�s mysterious plan is with the number eight!) By the loving mercy of HG Vaisesika Prabhu and Mother Nirakula, a most extraordinary miracle took place�they arranged for you to visit our home. Guru Maharaj, such blessings are far beyond what someone like me could ever deserve. Yet, by your causeless compassion and their affection, that sacred moment became a reality. I remain forever grateful for the day you filled our home with your divine presence and spoke such beautiful, heart-transforming instructions�on how to share Krishna consciousness with love, compassion, and a nonjudgmental heart. I especially treasure your words reminding me that the best way to preach is to carefully nourish one�s own sdhana, for when our hearts are purified, preaching naturally flows with grace. That instruction has stayed within me like a lamp in my heart, guiding my efforts ever since.\n\nGuru Maharaj, you have given meaning, direction, and shelter to my life. Even in moments of distance, your voice resounds within my heart�steady, compassionate, and unwavering. You have taught me that true devotion is not measured by proximity but by sincerity of service and purity of heart. My prayer on this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vysa Pj is that I may continue to serve in whatever small way pleases you, with humility, gratitude, and dedication.\n\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for your boundless mercy, for your patience with my many shortcomings, and for never giving up on souls like me. May I always remain the servant of the servant of the servant, striving to live by your teachings and share your message of love and devotion wherever I go.\n\nWith deepest gratitude,\nYour aspiring servant,\nTulasi Bhakti Dev Ds"

These teachings can save many lives and humanity.\nI desire to make these teachings my life and soul.\nguru-mukha-padma-vkya, cittete koribo aikya, r n koriho mane \nLast year in Mypur Yatra I heard from your lotus mouth and I observed it personally:\n\n1. Intense Japa in Devotee Association\nEvery morning you make it a point to chant with devotees intensely. How important it is to chant together in association with devotees feelingly early in the morning � putting chanting as the highest priority.\nIt�s mentioned that out of all the instructions of the spiritual master, chanting 16 rounds is the most important.\nYou received the mah-mantra from Mother Gag and later from His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami rla Prabhupda.\nIt�s really impressive and inspiring to see that you take up doing intense japa so seriously.\nWherever you are in the world, you try to chant with devotees and also try to chant the whole day whenever there is free time after 16 rounds are complete.\nThis is a great inspiration for me.\nThose six days of chanting with you in r Mypur Dhm are my greatest treasure that I shall cherish my whole life.\n\n2. Hearing from rla Prabhupda Daily\nYou hear from rla Prabhupda�s recorded lectures every day.\nOut of the 64 items of devotional service described in r Bhakti-rasmta-sindhu, the first three are related to the spiritual master: r-guru-pdraya, dk, and sev.\nYou have taken this so seriously and that�s so inspiring to see.\nI also wish to make it a goal that I hear from you every day and thereby nourish the most important connection.\n\n3. Sensitivity Toward Vaishnavas\nLast time in r Mypur Dhm Yatra, I was deeply touched to see your sensitivity.\nOn Nov 5th, during rla Prabhupda�s disappearance observance, when the time was ticking, you let HG Mandkin Mtaji go on with her offering and also let HG Mlati Mtaji speak next � who promptly pointed to the time for �Je Anilo Premadhana� prayer, which was your turn to sing.\nSometimes we are so obsessed with time that we don�t mind doing offenses, but I was very touched and impressed to see your Vaiava ideal behavior � putting the feelings and satisfaction of Vaiavas above time.\n\n4. Magnanimous Acceptance of All Devotees\nLast Mypur Yatra, around 12,000 devotees came.\nYou had every option and justification to reject or cut off after a certain number, but you accepted all with an open, compassionate, magnanimous heart.\nIn fact, it�s the new mission statement of the Yatra committee:\n�The more the devotees, the more there are opportunities to serve.�\nWhat a broad and magnanimous way to encourage everyone.\n\n5. Humility in Personal Comfort\nLast Vysa-pj meeting, HG Vaieika Mahrja shared that one time when all of you had to go somewhere, you took the back folded difficult seat of the car and gave everyone the comfortable seat.\nThat was so inspiring � to see how to put oneself last and everyone else first.\n\nThere are many, many more things that inspire all of us from your teachings and personal example, but for this year I want to keep the above five as my goal and inspiration to follow.\nI wish to please you by following these principles in my life.\nDear Guru Maharaj, I honestly admit that I have been falling short, but today I recommit to follow your instructions and be a true disciple by disciplining myself to follow your instructions.\nI beg forgiveness for my shortcomings and beg for your mercy and empowerment.\nI pray to Their Lordships to give you good health so that you can deliver more and more souls.\nThank you very much.\nEternally indebted to you.\nYour Aspiring Servant,\nShyamrupa Das"

Truly, this Kartik Yatra is not just a pilgrimage � it is a life-transforming journey for the soul. It is a divine gift where we receive immense spiritual nourishment.

You have given meaning, direction, and purpose to my otherwise lost life.\n\nBeing an insignificant soul, I can only pray again and again for your causeless mercy and shelter.

    "Your Offering": "om aj�na-timirndhasya j�n�jana-alkay\ncakur unmilita yena tasmai r-gurave nama\n\nOffering to HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj\nDearest Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept our most humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\nAll glories to rla Prabhupda.\nAll glories to you, our ever well-wisher and compassionate spiritual guide.\nAmong your innumerable divine qualities, we wish to glorify two that have especially touched our hearts � your aura and your merciful heart.\nWe began visiting r r Rdh Gopnath Temple regularly in the years 2001�2003. At that time, our daughter Parusha was about nine years old and our son Parth was just three and a half. Even at that young age, both our children were deeply touched by the divine atmosphere of the temple and by your saintly presence.\nParth would observe you with great attention and awe. He was especially inspired by your unique way of beginning a lecture � after singing the magala-caraa, you would fold your hands, glance lovingly across the assembled devotees from one end to the other, and in that sacred silence, every heart would become still. Then, softly, you would begin your class, and the hall would fill with transcendental wisdom and love.\nAt home, Parth would imitate you with devotion. Sitting on the sofa, he would ask us to sit in front of him, fold his little hands, and slowly glance over us � expecting the same silence you inspired in the temple. When we failed to comply, he would innocently ask, �When Maharaj does this, everyone becomes quiet � why not you� We would all laugh, then fall silent, delighting his heart.\nYour words too, Maharaj, left a deep mark on him. You often reminded us that within the temple, we are protected from My, but as soon as we step out, she waits to bewilder us. After each Sunday programme, as we stepped outside, little Parth would hold our hands tightly and whisper with concern, �Papa, My is standing outside � she will catch us!� That childlike faith still brings tears to our eyes and reminds us of your ever-merciful protection.\nYou have always been so affectionate toward children. Once, you lovingly placed your hand on Parth�s head, and we felt our lives were blessed forever. You instructed us to bring up our children in Krishna Consciousness as a service to the Lord. We took this instruction to heart and made it our life�s mission.\nOur daughter Parusha too has grown beautifully under your merciful guidance. She completed her engineering and MBA from reputed institutions and is now married. Although absorbed in her family life, she holds deep respect for Krishna Consciousness and tries sincerely to imbibe and share these values. She is now nurturing her one-year-old daughter with affection and care � introducing her to Krishna from her earliest days. It fills our hearts with gratitude to see this spiritual legacy flowing to the next generation, all by your divine grace.\nGuru Maharaj, out of your causeless mercy, you accepted us � though utterly unqualified � as your disciples in the year 2008. Your compassion, instructions, and personal example continue to be our guiding light.\nBy your blessings, Parth has completed his engineering from IIT Delhi and continues to chant 16 rounds daily, study Bhagavad-gt As It Is and rmad-Bhgavatam, and sincerely strive to become a humble devotee. We are confident that, with your mercy and the association of devotees, both our children and our grandchild will continue to grow in Krishna Consciousness and serve rla Prabhupda�s mission with sincerity.\nGuru Maharaj, words can never express our gratitude for your boundless love and mercy. Your divine aura continues to illuminate our hearts, and your compassion sustains our spiritual journey.\nAll glories to rla Prabhupda.\nAll glories to you, our beloved spiritual master, HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj.\nYour unworthy servants,\n\nAnand Nidhi Das\nAnandni Priya Devi Dasi"

All that I felt was: \"See how heroic Guru Maharaj is in this video!\" I really felt that, and that's why I played it many times to see his smile, his walk, his speech again and again. Everything is so beautiful.\n\nBut after I started hearing the lectures of Guru Maharaj, and aspiring from him, while watching the same video after a long gap, I don't know. Tears were rolling in my eyes. I cried by the middle of the video. I was not even able to hold it at one point. After trying hard for 10+ seconds, I stopped the video, wiping my tears.\n\nAnd what I felt was that, \"I am so much unqualified, still foolishly aspiring from Maharaj.\" And remembering how I have so many times compromised in tough (mentally) times, without sticking to the promises and principles. I felt sorry, sorry Maharaj, I am so sorry. I am not worthy.\n\nI am very much clear that I know myself very well. It doesn't take me more than 5 minutes to slip into a deep drowsy state while hearing lectures. Even one year is not enough for me to complete a small book (50-100 pages). 16 rounds will be done � late at night or sometimes the next day. Not even 12 Mangala Aratis a year.\n\nIt is only your greatness, Maharaj, through the mercy of devotees, that I am able to improve in my sadhana standards, like chanting early in the morning, developing taste in lectures, attending Mangala Aratis frequently. Maharaj's lectures are an oasis; they rejuvenate me whenever I take Maharaj's association.\n\nI beg for your forgiveness and mercy, Maharaj, for all my negligence. Kindly accept this poor soul. I would like to remain in the association of devotees, serving the Lordships and devotees, balancing my family responsibilities. Please bless me in developing loving relationships with devotees and servitude, Maharaj.\n\nWishing you a shubha Krishna conscious birthday, Maharaj.\nYour insignificant servant"

Happy 75th Appearance Day Maharaj!\n\nI have completed one year in the ISKCON family and wish to continue my journey with your due blessings. This year has been a tough yet mesmerizing year in the company of Vaishnavas. Though I have not yet been successful in convincing my family of the sweet nectar of spirituality and Shri Krishna bhakti, I often lie at home and attend satsang at Vashi and visit Chowpatty temple with my dear friend, who also happens to be a part of ISKCON for many years. Though I haven't seen or met you in person, I have been immensely blessed and loved by your followers. Your glories are regularly reflected by the love and treatment I receive from the matajis. Pujya Radhika Mataji and Madri Mataji here at Mumbai love me immensely and treat me as their own. Their love and affection bring tears to my eyes. I have been unable to express how blessed I feel every time I meet them. Both of them always entertain my nonsense questions and embrace my silly behavior with open hands. They have always told me that the love and affection I receive has been the reason for your teachings and blessings. The matajis here have always glorified you so much through their actions that I have been lost for words. Each and every person who loves you has been glorifying you through his/her love, actions, and words. Your followers are a magnificent reflection of you. Today, Chowpatty temple has been the place where I am at peace. Though I have visited it only four times, I immensely miss it every day. I have been desperately willing to do sewa at the temple ever since. And this is all because of your efforts that the beauty of the temple doesn't only leave the visitors in awe but also at peace. I hope my struggles convincing my parents end someday, and we together as a family can be a part of ISKCON. Last year, I had written to you for the first time on the same occasion by only listening about you from my very friend at ISKCON. I have been told that you read each and every letter written to you. Hope this offering of mine also comes across you, and if possible, please bless me to grow in Shri Krishna bhakti. Honestly, I am not a disciplined and sincere girl. I haven't been able to carry out my life roles in my various relationships as expected. I have been always mentally and emotionally unstable all my life, not able to figure out my goals and purpose of life. My failures and confusions are making me lazy day by day. I have lost my desire to do anything in life. I am always in a confusion if I am walking the right path.\n\nI know this offering was meant to glorify you, but I wish to offer my list of drawbacks and faults within me. I only wish to seek shelter at the holy feet of that Guru Maharaj whose followers have constantly been an ocean of love and kindness, generosity, and forgiveness to me. I thereby request you to please bless me as well so that I become a better human being and be of some use to you and the Almighty. Thank you for all the teachings, love, affection, kindness I received through your followers. Hare Krishna Guru Maharaj. Keep smiling.\n\nYour eternal servant,\nNupur Lad."

Hearing from them about your great qualities, your gratitude, genuine humility, your deep meditation on how to serve Srila Prabhupada, and about your dream project, Govardhan Eco Village, how meticulously and with a great prayerful mood you developed this project.\nNot only this, but anything you do is full of heart and prayerful mood, always meditating on the pleasure of Guru and Gauranga. Your chanting of HOLY NAMES, giving classes, meeting with devotees is filled with deep service attitude.\n\nI feel great joy and pride sometimes to be able to receive such a glorious shelter like you and the shelter of Srila Prabhupada through your representatives.\n\nYour lectures and personal example give me great inspiration to go on in my spiritual life. Whatever obstacles I face in my journey of KC, when I remember your journey and Srila Prabhupada, I feel my struggles are so insignificant and not worthy to complain.\n\nCurrently, I am rendering service in Sri Sri Radha Madan Mohan Temple, ISKCON HYDERABAD. Under the guidance of HG RADHE SYAM PRABHU, I am engaged in some preaching and deity services. I am struggling with my mind and senses, but you are kindly using me as a humble instrument in the mission of Srila Prabhupada. Your great appreciation for any devotee who renders whatever small service in the mission of Srila Prabhupada always makes me appreciate how much you love Srila Prabhupada.\n\nI aspire for this quality of yours: you appreciate with a great heart all the services of your God Brothers and God Sisters and any devotee in the mission of Srila Prabhupada. This quality of absolute non-enviousness, taking great pleasure in others' services for the pleasure of Sri Guru, you always taught us. This is the mood of Sri Vrindavan. You always try to imbibe this spirit in all of us, but I struggle to appreciate other devotees' wonderful services, of theirs helping so many, so many souls come close to the Lotus Feet of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nOn this most auspicious occasion of Your Divine appearance, I pray at your lotus feet that I should remain loyal to the vows I took at initiation and love and appreciate all devotees, and continue to render service till the end of life.\nSeeking your blessings.\n\nYour servant,\nPrem Nartan Das."

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my most humble and respectful obeisances at your divine lotus feet. All glories to Srila Prabhupada! All glories to the Sri Guru Parampara!\n\nOn this auspicious occasion, I am overwhelmed with gratitude as I attempt to express my heartfelt appreciation for your causeless mercy upon this most fallen soul.\n\nGuru Maharaj, the sacred Karthik month yatras under your divine guidance have been nothing short of transcendental revelations. To witness thousands of devotees gathered together, unified in devotion to Sri Sri Radha Krishna, is a testament to your potent preaching and compassionate heart. Through your illuminating Krishna kathas during these yatras, you have revealed the hidden glories of the Holy Dhams in ways that have penetrated deep into our hearts. Each pastime you narrated was like drinking the sweetest nectar�awakening our dormant love for Krishna and connecting us to the eternal spiritual realm. Your words have the power to transport us beyond the material dimension, allowing us to glimpse the divine pastimes unfolding in Vrindavan, Mayapur, and other sacred places. The way you unveiled the esoteric meanings behind each holy tirtha, each sacred spot where the Lord performed His pastimes, has enriched our understanding beyond measure. These are not mere stories, Guru Maharaj�through your realized devotion, they become living truths that transform our consciousness.\n\nI am eternally indebted to you for accepting this unqualified servant into the sacred Guru-Shishya Parampara. What pious activities could I have possibly performed to receive such undeserved mercy You have given me spiritual birth, connecting me to the illustrious chain of disciplic succession descending from Sri Krishna Himself, through Lord Brahma, Narada Muni, Vyasadeva, down to our beloved Srila Prabhupada, and now to your divine self.\nYou have taken the responsibility for my spiritual advancement, and I can never repay this debt. You have planted the seed of bhakti in the barren field of my heart and continue to water it with your transcendental instructions, ensuring it grows into the creeper of devotion that will one day reach the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha-Vrindavanchandra.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I also want to express my deep appreciation for the wonderful association of my senior godbrothers and godsisters whom you have blessed me with. They are living embodiments of your teachings and have shown me such kindness, patience, and compassion. Their instructions have been invaluable guideposts on this challenging path of Krishna consciousness. When I stumble, they lift me up. When I am confused, they illuminate the way forward. When my determination wanes, they inspire me through their own exemplary dedication and service attitude. Through their association, I am learning what it truly means to be part of a Vaishnava family�how to serve with humility, how to cooperate in Krishna's mission, and how to see every devotee as more qualified than myself. They have tolerated my shortcomings with such grace and encouraged my feeble attempts at devotional service.\n\nGuru Maharaj, in this age of Kali, where maya is so strong and the pull of material desires so overwhelming, your instructions are my only shelter. Your classes, your kirtans, your personal example of pure devotion�these are the lights that guide me through the darkness of ignorance.\n\nYou have taught all of us:\n\n1. Importance of attentive chanting\n2. Following 4 regulative principles very strictly\n3. Following Dos & Don'ts of NOI\n4. The art of balancing sadhana with service\n5. How to cultivate genuine humility and tolerance\n6. The necessity of studying Srila Prabhupada's books with devotion\n7. How to serve the devotee community with a mood of humble servant or servants\n8. Never aspire for any posts or positions\n\nEvery instruction you give us through your lectures is a jewel and we try to preserve it in our hearts, knowing that following your guidance is the perfection of my life.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I am very much aware of my innumerable disqualifications, my tendency toward laziness, my flickering determination, and my contaminated consciousness. Yet your mercy is so powerful that it can transform even a stone-hearted person like me. I humbly pray that you continue to engage me in the service of your mission. Please keep me close to your lotus feet and never let me stray from the path you have so lovingly shown me. May I never disappoint you or bring any disrepute to your glorious name.\n\nLet me always remember that I am nothing without your shelter, and that my only success lies in faithfully executing your instructions with a servant's heart.\n\nMy only aspiration, Guru Maharaj, is to serve you birth after birth. Whether I am in this body or another, in this realm or beyond, may I always remain your humble servant, assisting in your mission to spread the glories of Sri Krishna and the teachings of Srila Prabhupada throughout the world.\n\nThank you for everything you have given me�for the Holy Name, for Krishna consciousness, for spiritual family, for hope, for purpose, for love. You have shown me the path home, back to Godhead, and I pray I may follow it faithfully under your divine guidance.\n\nBegging to remain your eternal servant,\nYour most insignificant disciple,\nMukund Anand Das, Parameshwari DD, Vimala & Counsillees Family"

On the SPP disappearance day, \"je anilo\" by you was so heart-touching, and we could learn how one should be attached to his spiritual master.  Your grateful attitude towards your Guru Maharaj and your god brothers and sisters is surely our learning point, showing how one should behave humbly not only towards god brothers but every Vaishnav.  Your enthusiasm, humility, attitude of gratitude, deep-rooted love for Krishna and Shrimati Radharani, and karuna towards every soul � every quality is like a nectarian ocean, and we are seeking a drop of it for our spiritual upliftment.\n\nMay Radha Vrindavan Chandra give us your long, long association for many, many years further. \n\nYour insignificant servant of the servant,\nParjat Leela dd and family.

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\n\nOn your very auspicious 75th appearance day, I would like to highlight one of the prominent qualities you have exhibited in your spiritually absorbed journey in this world.\n\nYou have many times in your lectures shared that the root of all virtues and good qualities lies in one quality which is gratitude. We have seen that you have spent your entire life expressing gratitude to everyone you came across. You have always remembered and highlighted the good qualities that your mother taught you in your early days. Once when you presented a beautiful rose to your mother on her birthday, which was grown and nourished by your mother herself, you shared the beautiful lesson that your mother taught you � it�s not the gift that matters, it�s the thought that matters � the thought of expressing gratitude.\n\nIn one of the vyaspuja ceremonies held in Mumbai in 2008, from deep within your heart you expressed gratitude to your father, recollecting his words he told you when you were in your teens � \"I am with you my son in whatever you do. I will never leave you.\" You mentioned how you tested this promise of your father beyond his imagination and how the promise given by your father never wavered.\n\nThe gratitude that you have for Srila Prabhupada in your heart is oceanic. In all your classes you mention your gratitude towards Srila Prabhupada. In fact, it is impossible to find or hear such a class wherein you don�t express your deep gratitude to Srila Prabhupada. The first session in all Kartik yatras held so far, you glorify Srila Prabhupada by discussing the struggles he went through in giving us this rare gift of KC. In one of your Vyas Puja offerings in 2021 during covid times, you gave a beautiful definition to the word \"Founder Acharya\" � you said:\nFounder Acharya is the acharya who found you and your Godbrothers/Sisters and all the devotees is the Founder Acharya. It is indeed our great fortune that we were found by Srila Prabhupada through you Guru Maharaj.\nGurudev, your love for Srila Prabhupada is evident with your knowing and understanding the mood of Srila Prabhupada from every little detail of his life. Your love for Srila Prabhupada is also seen in how you show your love, care, and affection to all your godbrothers and godsisters.\n\nThe biggest gift you have given to Srila Prabhupada is the restoration of the Bhaktivinod Bhaithak at the Ultadanga junction along with Srila Prabhupada�s birthplace in Kolkata. The place wherein the seed of ISKCON was sown is now accessible to devotees across the world.\nGeV, the Bhaktivedanta Hospital, and now a new hospital in Barsana are now inspiring thousands in India and across the world to take up the teachings of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\nJust like you express your gratitude for Srila Prabhupada, you never miss expressing your gratitude towards all the disciples, followers, and well-wishers in your classes.\nYou renamed your vyaspuja celebration as the \"Festival of Gratitude,\" considering this as a wonderful opportunity wherein everyone can openly express their gratitude towards their spiritual master, and you also express deep gratitude towards Srila Prabhupada and all our previous acharyas. In my view, this whole event is Prabhupada and Acharya-centric, as you keep yourself out of the limelight. In the last Festival of Gratitude, you didn't even take a vyas asan to give the address. You accepted a simple chair to sit wherein you were not seen at all.\nIn your quest for finding the Supreme Absolute Truth, you came across so many saints and babas � like Tat Wala Baba, the baba who gave you saintly robes in Rishikesh, Naga Babas, Ramesh Baba in Barsana, and many others. You learned from each one of them, remembering their teachings till date and expressing your gratitude towards them in your \"Journey Home\" book. Your heart was full of love and gratitude while you were eagerly making a request to the Sikh gentleman to allow you to enter India from the Ferozepur border.\n\nThe profound statement you gave in one of your lectures � \"A heart full of gratitude is the abode of the Lord\" � has personally touched me a lot. By your mercy, I started sharing the teachings of BG through the online Geeta Jivan sessions. It�s been 34 continuous weeks, and about 8-10 people join the classes, and a couple of them have started chanting. I am also regularly hearing the daily SPORT sessions taken by HG Mukundanand Pr Ji. On this auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja, I beg at your lotus feet and pray that I develop deep feelings of gratitude and realize the pains you have taken to give us the shelter of SP and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. That I realize the importance of this human form of life and utilize my time in the best possible way. I also beg forgiveness for my shortcomings and mistakes that I�ve made so far. Please bless me and my family so that we remain sincere in the path of Bhakti by following your instructions and remain grateful to you throughout life.\n\nYours in Service,\nGaurang, Shweta &\nGaurav Mahajan"

Your memories come to our hearts, and we remember how you drown us all in calmness and bliss with the chants of Hare Krishna. It always rings in my ears the two things you said years ago when we had your association in Kurukshetra.\n\nOne time in Singhal�s house, you said in quietude, �I am willing to help you to fulfill your desire to serve Srila Prabhupada, his ISKCON Movement.� This was when my issue was not getting sorted out in the GBC meetings. Although I wasn�t exactly your disciple, nevertheless, you had never discriminated and have always shown compassion to help me in my spiritual life.\n\nSecond time, when you had reinitiated me in my sanyas order of life, formalizing my position in ISKCON. That was in Jyotisar of Kurukshetra, in the presence of all the temple devotees. You had said, �I want to see you serve Srila Prabhupada to your heart�s content.�\n\nThe time I had spent with you was my fortune, which isn�t possible now, be it with you on your tours in the US, Athens, Pittsburg, Cincinnati, and Columbus.

Your mood of servant of the devotees and your humble demeanor make you comfortable and accommodate one and all.

But if we find joy within ourselves, we will always live a life free from many complications.\"\"\n In this way, Guru Maharaj Ji, by learning from the adverse circumstances of his own life, imparted education to all of us and doing all good for us.\n\nHeartfelt gratitude\n\nMahaprabhu Kirtan Das\nand\nNavya Lalita Devi Dasi"

By the boundless mercy of the Lord, I am receiving guidance under the care of a wonderful and deeply realized devotee � HG Dinanath Gopal Prabhuji, your beloved disciple.\n.\nThough Prabhuji never instructed or suggested that I choose you as my Guru, his humility, tolerance, and dedication reflected your divine qualities so profoundly that my heart naturally found its way to you. By observing his behavior and his deep affection for you, I could feel your presence and mercy flowing through him.\n.\nMaharaj, your teachings have become the guiding light of my spiritual journey. Every word you speak carries the fragrance of Srila Prabhupada's compassion. Through your lectures and pastimes, I have realized that bhakti is not attained by knowledge or renunciation alone but by sincerely offering one's heart in loving service.\n.\nWhen I hear your pastimes � how you left the comfort of worldly life, wandered across lands in search of truth, and finally surrendered at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada in 1971 � my heart trembles with awe. You are a living example of the verse:\n\n�sa vai pus paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokaje\nahaituky apratihat yaytm suprasdati�\n(SB : 1.2.6)\n�The supreme occupation for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotion must be causeless and uninterrupted to completely satisfy the self.�\n.\nMaharaj, your life is the embodiment of this pure devotion.\n.\nYour lecture on \"The Power of Forgiveness\" (2015) taught me that true strength lies not in defeating others, but in conquering one's own ego.\nIn \"Compassion � The Essence of Spiritual Life\" (GEV, 2018), you revealed that real bhakti is to see every living being as a child of Krishna.\nAnd in your book \"The Journey Home � The Journey Within� (2019), I understood that Krishna consciousness is not an escape from the world but the deepest connection to its divine essence.\n.\nDuring this recent Kartik Yatra in Govardhan, I received your darshan for the first time. I cannot express the feeling that arose within me. As I saw your effulgent form, my heart overflowed with tears of gratitude. It felt as if time stood still, and Srila Prabhupada whispered in my heart, \"This is your shelter.\" Your effulgence didn�t just light up the atmosphere � it illuminated my inner darkness.\n.\nSince that sacred moment, I have been trying to walk the path of devotion under the gentle guidance of my Shiksha Guru, HG Dinanath Gopal Prabhuji. His nurturing care and spiritual upbringing constantly nourish my faith and help me remain steady in ISKCON�s service. By Srila Prabhupada's grace, I completed my IDC in 2024, and I am learning to serve sincerely in small ways.\n.\nMaharaj, I have no qualifications, � only prayers. Still, I beg at your lotus feet that one day, if Krishna so desires and if you deem me worthy, I may receive your shelter and serve Srila Prabhupada's mission with a pure heart. To be accepted as your disciple would be the greatest fortune of countless lifetimes.\n\n\"tasmd guru prapadyeta jij�su reya uttamam\nbde pare ca nita brahmay upaamrayam�\n(SB : 11.3.21)\n�Therefore, one who desires real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him with great faith and devotion.�\n.\nMaharaj, your contribution to society � through Govardhan Eco Village, your heartfelt lectures, your compassion toward devotees and non-devotees alike � continues to transform countless lives. You have taught me that the true wealth of life is to love and to serve.\n.\nThough physically distant, I always feel your presence in the gentle whisper of kirtan and in every moment of sincere service. When I remember your smile and your words, my heart feels both the sweetness of connection and the pain of longing� a reminder of how unqualified yet hopeful this insignificant servant truly is.\n.\nI offer my deepest gratitude to Srila Prabhupada and to you, Maharaj, for giving us the priceless gift of Krishna consciousness. I pray to remain forever a small speck of dust at your lotus feet � serving Srila Prabhupada's mission, trying to associate with the devotees, and dedicating my every breath to spreading the message of bhakti just as all ACBSP disciples have done for him.\n.\nYour divine effulgence, your humility, and your compassion have kindled a flame of devotion within me that I pray may never extinguish.\n.\nPraying to sri sri radha madhav for your good health and long live.\n.\nYour insignificant aspiring servant,\nSiddharth Dubey\n(ISKCON Kanpur)\nWishing you a very, very happy 75th appearance day, Maharaj.

You said that:\n\n1) \"The highest prayer is the prayer to become a selfless instrument in God's hands.\"\n\n- Gurudev, here you want to teach us that Krishna is our only hope. Whatever situation we are facing, just leave it in His hands, become His puppet. Being a selfless instrument will please the Lord.\n\n2) \"Just serve every creature in God's creation with humility, respect, and love.\"\n\n- From this, I can understand that all creatures are God's children, and Krishna loves all of them. Once, in the Radha Gopinath temple, there was a cat which was hurt badly, and you were so compassionate towards it that you wanted to make sure the cat received good medical care, and daily Mahaprasad was offered to that cat. Your love for cows is even more adorable to me.\n\n3) �When we speak of the dust of the lotus feet of the Spiritual Master, we are speaking of a humble approach to serve his instructions. Unless we humbly serve the instructions of the great soul, it is Krishna�s arrangement that He never reveals Himself.�\n\n- This is the real essence that you want to teach us: that the dust of the lotus feet of the spiritual master is to follow the instructions of the Guru. Otherwise, Krsna will never reveal Himself to us.\n\nGurudev, your love towards your Godbrothers and Godsisters is so adorable. You always talk about cooperation and unity in most of your classes. You always want us to be like a family and try to serve all with humility.\nOn this auspicious day, I pray that I can become a puppet in Krsna's hand and follow your instructions with utmost sincerity and humility.

Though, I am not even sure whether I truly have love for you, or if I am merely pretending to love you just to show others.\n\nI have known you since the time when I did not even know about ISKCON. Perhaps it is only by your causeless mercy that I became connected to ISKCON and the Guru Parampara. I come from a family of caste Brahmins where ritualistic activities are considered the essence of devotion, but by the mercy of you and devotees, I have come to understand the true meaning of bhakti. I have accepted you as my spiritual master, and I pray to the Lord Radha Shyam-Sundar for the day when you will accept me as your disciple.\n\nDevotion teaches us something from every Vaishnava, but from you, I have learned selfless love for the Lord. You always speak about the welfare of humanity, and the true welfare, as you teach, is to bring every living being closer to Radha & Krishna. Your compassion for all living entities and your continued efforts for the welfare of society, even while facing ill health, are a great source of inspiration for every disciple.\n\nYou have taught that all living beings, no matter what body they inhabit, are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and to harm them is to cause pain to the Lord Himself. This is the true mark of a pure Vaishnava. You have shown me the right path to live by, and I know that countless lives have been transformed through your guidance. You are very dear to Srila Prabhupada, and by receiving your mercy, we too can become dear to the great Acharyas.\n\nWhenever I see you, I am reminded of the teaching of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu � �, , ,   �.

Our children were of school-going age.\n15 and 12. We were staying just a kilometer from Sri Sri Radha Gopinath temple, at Grant Road West.\n\nLalitha Priya was attending Mangal Aarti daily from mid-1994 and would leave after Tulsi Aarti. At home, my father was perturbed seeing our growing involvement in the temple activities. He said, \"I am not against God or religion, but against the institutionalization of religion. 10 or 20 minutes is all it takes to pray; the rest of the time should be for children and business.\" Of course, we were not neglecting our duties, but our engagement in the temple activities was steadily rising.\n\nLike we see in movies, when everything was just fine according to us, he felt we were going overboard. He ordered us to go and stay at a spare flat we had at Dahisar, almost 50 kilometers away. Our concern was the children's schooling. We were in a fix. Our counselor, HG Adikeshav Prabhu, brought us to you and said, \"They have become dear to Krishna.\" I was puzzled. He explained the situation to you.\n\nYou just thought it over for a minute and said, \"You go by your father's instruction. It will be better for your spiritual life.\" It was a tough choice. Your guidance gave us strength, and we went ahead. Daily, we brought our children to school and attended the temple too. We also had a few satsang programs in our house at Dahisar.\n\nBy the year, we were called back home. Parents' health started failing. Later, we had an astrological consultation and were told that in that period, father and son would not be able to stay under the same roof. So, Maharaj, you guided us perfectly and protected our spiritual life.\n\nWe are ever indebted to you not just for this but also for taking our son Radheshlal under your personal care and being a pillar of strength to our daughter Radha Preeti in her period of challenge.\n\nYou have given us a home beyond dreams in the family of your devotees.\n\nTo The Lotus Feet of,\nHH Radhanath Swami Maharaj.\n\nSuch are your teachings, Guru Maharaj,\nTo you, we owe all we have.\n\nThe highest one can ever have\nAre the names of God, far above all.\n\nIn the \"Journey Home,\" the book you share,\nAll the riches that you ever have,\n\nFor countless ones who seek the path\nThat leads them to the home of God.\n\nFor that is where the soul can rest\nAnd feel secure in God's embrace.\n\nFar, far away from the world of care,\nWhere one has no time to stand and stare.\n\nTo stand and stare at His beautiful face\nAnd absorb the beauty of Krishna's grace.\n\nThe lens in specs only clears one's sight,\nBut you, Maharaj, give insight.\n\nBhaktivedanta Hospital divine,\nGopal's Garden school pristine,\n\nGoverdhan Eco Village profound,\nWith Navadvip islands just around\n\nThe corner of time that's yet to come,\nWith Radha Gopinath at the core,\nAnd so many temples, also more.\n\nThe list can go on endlessly,\nAs your fertile plans flow ceaselessly.\n\nPlease bless us all on this day,\nThe seventy-fifth year of your appearance day.\n\nAt the lotus feet of Krishna, we pray\nTo make you stronger each passing day.\n\nBut for you, we'd have gone astray;\nEven a million thanks is too little to say.\n\nYour dasanudas\nLalitha Priya dd\nRadhapati das\nDecember 2025"

Please accept my humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet. My dear Guru Maharaj, for me, taking your association during Chowpatty temple Sunday feast lecture, taking your darshans, offering you obeisances, and hearing Krishna Katha from your lotus mukhkamal is the one and only source of relief to my heart which is burning and distressed by the challenges of this material world. There's no hope of life for me in this dangerous world, thus, O my dear Guru Maharaj, I pray again and again at your lotus feet, please be merciful to me and not reject me because of my disqualifications.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, Your surrender to Srila Prabhupada and Lord Chaitanya's mission inspires me and increases my hunger to be surrendered unto you. Your kindness is visible in my other god brothers and sisters, and I am also putting my efforts to be kind like them and practice as they are practicing to please you, Guru Maharaj.\nI am not even qualified to talk with you in person. I just wonder, will I ever be able to become qualified to even utter two words with Your Holiness\n\nBy your own life and example, Your Holiness has shown us what it truly means to follow and surrender to one�s spiritual master and to serve the sacred mission of Srila Prabhupada. Seeing your dedication gives hope to a fallen person like me, who otherwise has no strength of her own. I am deeply grateful for the shelter you have given me. By your mercy alone, I have the courage to continue and to keep trying, in whatever way I can, to serve the Vaishnavas and contribute to the mission.\n\nI beg your forgiveness and mercy, Guru Maharaj, for all those wrongdoings that I may have done due to my immaturity and disqualifications. I pray for the strength to remain faithful and to serve with sincerity. You are my everything, and I am completely yours.\n\nYours insignificant servant,\nDivyakriti Radha devi dasi."

With every stage of your journey, you have guided me, and in the end, my own life became intertwined with Krishna Consciousness. I now consider myself one of the most fortunate souls in this world.\n\nI have not yet had the blessing to visit Vrindavan, nor the opportunity to attend your class in person, but every Friday in our group we study your lectures. Our hearts are purified, and tears of devotion flow freely, binding us closer to Krishna.

This year Kartika yatra was so special, like every year. It was only because of your desire that we had the greatest and rarest of fortune of staying in Govardhan for 7 days and nights. We are so grateful to you. Every moment was so unique and special. You nourished us with such wonderful hari katha for hours and hours. We may feel tired at times, but your enthusiasm to speak hari katha is never diminished. You gave so many important instructions on how to cultivate the mood of a beggar, how each moment is so precious in association of devotees, how we should take shelter of the holy name, and how Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has come to give us the highest benediction. You always concluded your katha by speaking about Gaura Lila. Please bless me so that I can take shelter of your lotus feet through your vani.\n\nAs always, you performed most enchanting kirtans and you made everyone cry out for Krsna. You gave us the most beautiful spiritual experience of our life. As you mentioned so many times in your katha, we are not qualified to receive this, but due to your and Srila Prabhupada's causeless mercy on us, we received these precious gifts. We are eternally grateful to you.\n\nWe had a wonderful experience of cooking for Govardhan Puja under the lotus feet of Govardhan. As you mentioned in your class that day, it was so purifying, both externally and internally, for body, mind, and heart. You personally visited the cooking area to encourage all devotees; you showered your merciful glance on all and blessed us all, and by your and Giriraj's blessings, devotees could make more than 3500+ offerings of love and devotion. Thank you so much guru maharaj for this experience.\n\nGuru Maharaj, only and only by your mercy, I am trying to do some insignificant services here like taking kids' classes, participating in weekly programs, helping in organizing festivals and cultural events, participating every day in reading Srila Prabhupada's books, and trying to imbibe those teachings.\n\nI beg for your mercy so that I can follow your instructions sincerely, seriously, become a humble servant, learn to be tolerant, and work in cooperation with other devotees, by giving all respects to others and not expecting anything in return. You always teach us by your own example these Vaishnava qualities, but I fail to imbibe them. I beg you to please forgive me for all my shortcomings, for all my offenses unto your lotus feet.\n\nPraying to seek your blessings on this most auspicious 75th appearance day.

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Dandvat Pranam\nAll Glories to Srila Prabhupada. Jay Guru Dev.\n\nI am not so fortunate that I could see Srila Prabhupada personally, but like it is said that by getting to meet the son, you get a glimpse of the father, I am fortunate that I got many occasions to see, meet, hear, and associate with a wonderful and amazing son of Srila Prabhupada in the form of His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj.\n\nI beg pardon if it is not appropriate, but I feel so positively proud whenever I get to know and see how you are carrying out the legacy of Srila Prabhupada and extending his mercy and compassion throughout the world.\n\nFeeling so small with unsure words, unclear thoughts, and unframed sentences, but I do remember the teachings of my parents that whenever we get a chance to speak and glorify the devotees, we should try. That will not only purify us but also bestow blessings from all the Vaishnavas. So, with that selfish motive, I will try to gather my thoughts around the gifts that I have received from Maharaj since my birth.\n\nI am very fortunate and always count on the multiple blessings that I have received from Maharaj in my life. Just wondering what would have been if Maharaj would not have been there amongst all of us�\n\nIf Maharaj would not have given shelter to my parents, then I could not wish to have Krishna consciousness since childhood. Thank you, Maharaj, for extending your love through my parents to me since my birth.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for giving us Gopal�s Garden School where I never felt that we were in school. It was your vision that we should have a school which would be like a second home for students. All the teachers, staff, and everyone around was so loving and caring that we never felt that we wanted to go back home. We got all academic learning in a spiritualized way, which has not only made us competitive but also sensitive towards others and made us eligible to contribute to society by spreading Krishna Consciousness in our small, insignificant, but worthy way.\n\nI remember the day when your kind self was visiting our classroom, and you were accepting the small, unorganized welcome from each one of us. I can never forget that moment when I was carrying one small paper sketch of Srila Prabhupada and a small flute with an intention to offer it to you. I was a little skeptical and hesitant to offer, but just like Krishna forcibly took away the bag of chipped rice, you extended your hand in such a way that you got my feeling and desire. You took that from my hand, seen, and blessed me with your ever-shining big smile and your touch on my forehead. I wish and pray that at the last moment of my life, I can just remember your hand on my head and leave this world. Thank you, Maharaj, for always being so personal and approachable.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for giving us Sri Sri Radha Gopinath mandir, where we can get darshan of the beautiful deities of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, Lalitaji, Vishakhaji, Gopalji, and Gaur Nitai. You made us understand and inspired us to believe that daily, Sri Sri Radha Gopinath are performing their pastimes in the temple, and it is non-different from Golok Vrindavan.\n\nI express my deepest gratitude to your kind self for giving us congregational sangat of devotees, where everyone is extending compassion, care, and unconditional love with each other, which they have received from your kind self and your teachings and emphasis on devotee care. Truly, irrespective of the time frame of our ages, we always felt we were there for each other, and you were there for all of us. Your mood of menial serving attitude can be seen in every member of our congregation.\n\nMany times, in almost every lecture of yours, you speak about Vrindavan and always transport us to that place of divine love. There are many devotees in different parts of the world whose only goal in life is to come to India once in their lifetime, and they are working so hard to get arrangements for that. In that sense, we are fortunate that by your mercy, we can easily get access to the holy land of Vrindavan in the form of Govardhan Eco Village, where every brick, stone, and dust is a manifestation of your deep love for Vrindavan. Every visitor of Govardhan Eco Village gets the feeling of direct access to the holy abode of the Lord in a city like Mumbai. Thank you, Maharaj, for making it possible to access Vrindavan so easily with the same spirit of love and devotion.\n\nYou are like an ocean, and I am like a small conch. How much water of your mercy can I hold, which I have got from you, and how much can I share�\nBut even a drop of nectar can save many worlds, so with that spirit, I tried to purify my tongue�\n\nJust like a child speaks a language that only mother and father can understand, so I don�t know what I tried to speak, but I am sure my babbling will help my words to reach your lotus feet�\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for accepting me as your disciple recently in London and for giving me the beautiful spiritual name Ujjvala Kumari Devi Dasi. It has given me greater strength to serve and learn more in the mission of Srila Prabhupada. I am very grateful to you.\n\nI pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji that they bless you with a long, strong, and healthy life so that you can bring many children of Krishna back to Him. Children who are wandering since lifetimes after lifetimes in the temporary and miserable place of this material world. I am also praying that may I never forget your teachings and the wonderful experiences that you always give in your amazing Yatras.\n\n�Darshane Pavitra karo yehi tomar guna� but I would say �Smarane Pavitra karo yehi tomar bodo guna�. May I always feel your presence in my life, and may I honestly try to walk on the path that you have shown.\n\nThank you very much.\nHare Krishna\nJay Srila Prabhupada\nJay Gurudev"

The Sankirtan team had put up a drama based on Srila Prabhupada�s early days in New York. As requested by the devotees, I had the good fortune to play the role of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur and then the role of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nThe Sankirtan devotees were very much blessed by your association, especially on Sri Krishna Janmashtami (Saturday 16 August) and again on Srila Prabhupada�s Appearance Day (Sunday 17 August), when you came along with HH Svayam Bhagavan Keshav Maharaj, Pranabandhu Prabhu and Kanhaiya Prabhu to see the entire drama put up by the Sankirtan team. After the drama, you toured the exhibits made by the kids of our team, led by our Sankirtan leader Divyanama prabhu who showed you around the Sankirtan tent and introduced you to the devotees.\n\nThereafter, you returned to London in October to perform initiation ceremony for the devotees. The icing on the cake for us personally was the brahmin initiation you awarded to Prema Vilasini devi dasi at this time. Indeed, this provided both of us with renewed determination to render service to the mission of Sarila Prabhupada.\n\nDuring your October visit to London, in your presence and the senior management leaders at the Manor in Srila Prabhupada�s darshan room, the Sankirtan team offered the result of the Bhadra campaign � 546 sets of Srimad Bhagavatam sets distributed. Once again, we were very much blessed by your support and presence and this served to enliven the Sankirtan devotees to dedicate themselves to Srila Prabhupada�s mission with greater enthusiasm.\n\nOur main service remains distributing books given to us by Srila Prabhupada. While I have accompanied devotees to outdoor locations like Wembley Central Station, Wembley Ealing Road and many other locations, including Monthly Sankirtan Festivals, Prema Vilasini devi dasi has rendered service at the book table in the Sri Krishna Haveli. Her easy-going nature has brought several newcomers into the Sankirtan service.\n\nI continue to perform my Monday midday service washing pots and cleaning up after The Raj Bhaga offering at the Manor. Prema Vilasini devi dasi continues to help pujaris cook for the Deities at Bhaktivedanta Manor and the Soho Temple, while continuing her fortnightly service in the pujari room at the Manor and Soho temples.\n\nLooking back at our lives since we came to London in 1996, we feel Sri Krishna is guiding us in our lives, giving us the opportunity to associate with devotees, to learn the essence of devotional service and to render selfless service. By being close to the Manor (10 minutes away by car), we feel privileged to be able to regularly visit the Manor for darshan, to attend courses by School of Bhakti and to render devotional service.\n\nAlthough we do not deserve the causeless mercy that has somehow been showered upon us, we remain sincerely grateful for this incredible mercy and the wonderful association of devotees that remains our mainstay and support. Our eternal gratitude to our Founder-Acarya who laid the foundation of the ISKCON movement and under whose umbrella we remain committed servants. It is through the mercy of Srila Prabhupada that we came to know of the life and teachings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the combined form Sri Sri Radha-Krishna.\n\nThe beautiful Holy month of Kartik has just ended during which we had the opportunity to render more service, chant and read more. This incomparable month is truly blissful and provides great impetus for us to be sincere in our devotional practices.\n\nIn line with your instructions, we are endeavouring to remain the servants of the servants of the servants, rendering service to one and all without any expectation of praise or reward.\n\nAs we are both over 70 years of age, we have naturally slowed down. Nevertheless, we remain determined to render service on a regular basis. We humbly beg you to bless us that we continue to serve the Vaisnavas with love and affection.\n\nWe both look forward to having your association next month at the Festival of Gratitude at Govardhan ECO Village on 7 December 2025.\n\nIn gratitude, we remain, your eternal servants,\nChandra Caitanya das\nPrema Vilasini devi dasi\nLondon (UK)"

From the very first moment I heard your voice�soft yet thunderous with love for Krishna�I knew my life had found its true direction. Your every word, every glance, every smile has been a shower of nectar upon the barren field of my heart.\n\nI remember your tireless preaching in the early days�travelling from village to village, city to city, sometimes with fever, sometimes without proper rest�yet never compromising on your sadhana or your love for Srila Prabhupada�s mission. You taught us that devotion means to *live* for Krishna, not merely to speak about Him. Your life is the living Srimad-Bhagavatam�each chapter a lesson in surrender, each verse a call to love.\n\nEven now, at 75, your enthusiasm remains undimmed. You rise before dawn for mangala-arati, chant with tears in your eyes, and preach with the fire of a young brahmacari. Your journeys across continents, your care for thousands of disciples, your personal touch with every soul�these are not duties to you, but expressions of your spontaneous love for Guru and Gauranga.\n\nMaharaj, you have shown us that *bhakti* is not a ritual, but a revolution of the heart. You taught us to see Krishna in the eyes of every living being, to serve with humility, and to chant with longing. Your laughter melts material bondage; your silence speaks volumes of Vraja-prema.\n\nI am painfully aware of my countless shortcomings. I have failed to follow your instructions with the seriousness they deserve. My chanting is distracted, my service inconsistent, my heart still entangled in maya. Yet you never withdraw your mercy. Like Lord Caitanya with Jagai and Madhai, you embrace the most fallen.\n\nOn this sacred day, I beg only this: *Please never give up on me.* Let me remain forever a speck of dust at your lotus feet. If I have any good quality, it is only your mercy reflected. If I have any hope, it is only your grace.\n\nMay your divine health be protected by Sri Sri Radha-Gopinath.

You bring light to our lives and show us how to live a life of devotion, even in difficult times.

May Their unlimited and most precious blessings eternally flow through you to touch many, many more souls and inspire them to devote their lives to the mission of Lord Gauranga.\n\nGurudev, your life�s journey has been most inspiring and unparalleled. Your unflinching faith, unshakable determination, unlimited sacrifices, unbelievable austerities, boundless compassion, and above all, complete surrender to the Lord while seeking the essence are most amazing. You have always made yourself accessible to one and all without any discrimination, often while sacrificing your own health and comforts. Your energy and enthusiasm to preach and to give yourself completely to the mission of Srila Prabhupada is exemplary. Your loving dealings not only with your godbrothers and godsisters, senior devotees in the movement, neophytes, but also with every other living entity that comes in contact with your Holiness are most inspiring. You inspire everyone around you by personally living the teachings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, especially epitomizing the verse that you often quote as the very fabric of devotional service: 'trnad api sunicena taror iva sahishnuna, amanina manadena kirtaniya sada harih'.\n\nGurudev, you have so lovingly and graciously given us your mercy through your nectarian instructions, through the wonderful community of devotees, and through your most invaluable, yet most rare, personal association. We are grateful to the community of devotees that helps to keep us anchored, preventing us from going astray. But we earnestly and patiently wait for an opportunity to have your personal association to humbly serve you personally in order to recharge our spiritual journey.\n\nGurudev, despite the most precious opportunity that you have given to uplift our consciousness, we continue to falter and struggle with material sense enjoyment at every step of life. Our intense conditioning is always clouding our existence and pulling us back away from the real purpose of life. Our stubborn mind repeatedly ignores this precious opportunity and forces us to succumb to its desires. Please accept our most sincere apologies for any offenses committed knowingly or unknowingly at your lotus feet.\n\nGurudev, by your special mercy and the blessings of many devotees, including my elder brother, Gauranga Sundar Prabhu, I have been allowed to be of some insignificant service at the annual Barsana Eye Camp over the past many years. The opportunity to serve the Brajvasis in various capacities in the outpatient and inpatient wards, as well as in cataract operations, is most invaluable for an insignificant and unqualified soul like me. I am eternally grateful and sincerely pray that your mercy allows me to humbly serve them to the best of my abilities under the guidance of senior devotees in the future as well. May I always be reminded of your instruction that this special service is actually the most invaluable opportunity to clear my own cloudy, conditioned, and polluted material consciousness.\n\nGurudev, here in Singapore, we are blessed to have a very special congregation of devotees which include disciples of many exalted spiritual masters in Srila Prabhupada�s movement, as well as many of our own godbrothers and godsisters lovingly and co-operatively serving Sri Jagannath, Baladev, Subhadra Mai at the Gauranga centre under the guidance of HG Devakinandan Prabhuji. We are also so fortunate to have darshan of and an opportunity to hear from many spiritual masters and senior devotees who happen to travel through Singapore. Yet, we earnestly yearn for an opportunity to welcome you to Singapore once again and have your divine darshan, as well as hear from you again in person.\n\nWe once again wish you a very auspicious and glorious 75th appearance day.\n\nWith sincere gratitude, bowing down at your lotus feet,\n\nYour most insignificant and unqualified servants,\nAravind Govind Das, Achyuta Radhika Devi Dasi, Gopal and Govind\nSingapore"

Your life of selfless service continues to illuminate the path for so many wandering souls�myself included�showing what it truly means to live for the pleasure of Guru and Krishna.\n\nI reflect often upon the first time I met you; it still feels as though time stood still. My soul recognized its source�a homecoming beyond words. In that moment, a seed of devotion was planted so deep within my heart that even now, years later, I continue to water it through your instructions, through sdhana, and through serving under your shelter.\n\nThis year, one verse has echoed constantly within my heart as a reflection of your mercy and guidance:\n\n\"te satata-yuktn bhajat prti-prvakam\n dadmi buddhi-yoga ta yena mm upaynti te\"\n (Bhagavad-gt 10.10)\n\n\"To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\"\n\nMaharaja, I experience this verse not as a distant ideal, but as a living reality�revealed through your teachings and through the wisdom you�ve empowered in Kaustubha Das & Raghunath Das Prabhus, whom I am fortunate to have such close association with.

When I am tempted to rely on my own strength, I hear your gentle voice reminding me that true intelligence arises only when the heart is surrendered. You are teaching me that *buddhi-yoga* is not cleverness�it is the grace of divine understanding that flows when the heart is aligned in service.\n\nYour example continues to shape my every endeavor. Through your life, I am learning that devotion is not meant to be performed, but embodied; that spiritual strength is born from softness; that love is the highest intelligence.\n\nMaharaja, I pray to always remain connected to you through service, through the *sangha* of sincere devotees, and through the unceasing remembrance of your compassion and instructions. May I become a transparent instrument of your will, and may every step of my life bring glory to your mission and to rla Prabhupda�s legacy.\n\nWith a heart full of love, reverence, and unending gratitude, I offer myself again and again at your lotus feet.\n\nYour servant of the servant,\nKishori Gopi Devi Ds (from Vermont)"

They are always inviting the devotees for home programs. On festival days, most of the congregation gets involved in some way or other in performing devotional service.\nWe can't really express the great joy we experience trying to follow your footsteps.\nBy seeing your tireless efforts in developing the wonderful congregations like Chowpatty under your care, the projects like the Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Govardhan Eco-Village, and many others, I get amazed in seeing your dedication, care, and guidance you spend on every member, making them feel included in their respective yatras.\nIn order to start my days, the first thing I do after paying obeisances to you, SP, and to our home Deities, is to hear a brief class from SP, from you, or your amazing godbrothers while I prepare the paraphernalia for such home worship.\nIt's just so nectarean to hear from great and advanced devotees like yourself about Krishna katha, that once you take SP�s books and read them, all that has been heard from you resonates clearly, making the contents of it total sense.\nNow, after a break we had in performing temple devotional service, by the kind mercy of our wonderful temple president and the congregation of devotees here in Edmonton, we are making an attempt to please you, SP, and Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha-Govinda.\nIt�s very encouraging to see my dear wife eagerly serving in the pujari department, and my kids immersed in the different activities at the temple, dedicating their different talents to the service of the Lord. Please keep showering us with your kind mercy so we can keep up with the requirements to qualify as an\naspiring servant at your lotus feet.\nLord Krishna says in BG (18-66): sarva-dharmam parityajya, mam ekan saranam vraja, aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah.\nThe last sentence, ma sucah, \"do not fear, don't worry,\" really resonates in the heart of the devotees. Lord Krishna is giving assurance so we can gain confidence that all we need to do is to surrender to Him through the parampara system, very well established and carefully guarded by our acharyas.\nWe pray to the Lord to bless you with health and long life, so we can get your mercy and purify our existence as far as possible to properly serve you and SP.\nYour insignificant servant: Madhukantha das."

Your lectures inspire us to engage in the service of Krishna and the devotees.\nYou also engage all devotees in service.\n\nLast year, you mercifully accepted me as your disciple, a feat made possible only by your causeless mercy.\nYou are very kind to your disciples, but you expect them to practice true devotion.\n\nOn the occasion of this Vyasa Puja festival of yours, I pray at your lotus feet that\nI may faithfully follow your orders and always be in the association of devotees.\n\nYour servant,\nNityagopal Das"

Mercifully, please accept this.\nGuru Maharaj, on the auspicious day of your Vyas Puja, I was just meditating on the causeless mercy which I received from you without any of my personal qualification. I am so fallen & mad that I don't understand the value of what I have received. Guru Maharaj ji, in spite of knowing my so fallen condition, You have showered your causeless mercy upon me; that shows what a great level of compassion You have for us. You are the torchlight of knowledge to show the right path in this darkest material world for me & millions of others. You have such a deep love for Their Lordships, Srila Prabhupada, & for all living entities; it's the greatest hope for me & millions, trillions of living entities. You have given perfect pearls of divine instructions through your divine discourses, but in spite of knowing it, I am miserably failing to follow your instructions due to lack of my sincerity & lack of determination. So, Guru Maharaj ji, I beg strength & intelligence to understand & follow your divine instructions in my life to please you using body, mind, words, & all resources in serving Hari, Guru & Vaishnavas. You are the crest jewel & epitome of all devotion & compassion. Please bless me with selfless & pure love for you & also please bless me to make your instructions the life & soul of my life. Also, Guru Maharaj ji, I am offending holy names, the ultimate saviour, so please give me strength to chant lovingly, attentively, sincerely, devotionally, respectfully in the mood of a servant of servants of your servants. Guru Maharaj ji, as you say, detail in every aspect is a sign of love, so from Kartik Yatra arrangements, your oceanic love manifests for us in so much detail. You & the whole Yatra committee put numerous efforts to give a pleasurable enlightenment in the dham. Also, Guru Maharaj ji, how you have manifested Sri Vrindavan Dham in GEV with so minute details is very inspiring & adorable. This only a true empowered acharya like you can do. Your dealings with each & every Brajavasi & your God brothers is a manifestation of your selfless love & humble service attitude towards them.

I'm very thankful and grateful to you, Gurumaharaj, for everything you have given me. Oh Gurumaharaj, the day I was hearing about your humility towards devotees, your Godbrother, and even towards your disciples, I was shocked. I just say sorry to you, Gurumaharaj, that I'm not able to follow as you say, \"to be humbler than a blade of grass\" due to my lust, anger, and envy. Please forgive me for that, Gurumaharaj, but I promise soon I will become humbler than a blade of grass.\n\nAnd thank you very much, Gurumaharaj, for giving me your personal service in this Mahakumbh, and also thank you very much. By your mercy, I got the opportunity to associate and even did service with many of your senior disciples, and also got to know each other, get to know about you more by your disciples. And the main thing is that you have shown me mercy in the kitchen by touching my shoulder and then my head, and also I got a chance to quickly touch your lotus feet, and after that, I got a chance to take your maha maha prasad and wash your dishes and take prasad with the senior-most Godbrother. I just want to say that this Mahakumbh is very memorable for me because I got an opportunity to serve you. Although many of your disciples want to serve you, you chose me to serve. \"THANK YOU SOO MUCH GURUMAHARAJ.\"\n\nThen your mercy worked like that. When I started coming to the temple, I saw many devotees going to Vrindavan, Mathura, but I couldn't. Even when I chanted 16 rounds for one year, then I thought, \"Now I got a chance to go with devotees,\" but then also I couldn't go. I was literally very sad that a server devotee is going, why am I not going Even that devotee is going who came to the temple after me, who didn't chant 16 rounds also. I was literally very sad, Gurumaharaj. But then, on the day of the Kumbh Mela, I got mercy from you. After that, one week later, a devotee who is serving in the kitchen in sector 6 (Netra Kumbh) finished his service, and he made a plan to go to Vrindavan suddenly. And I literally thought, \"Then all these people will go, and I won't be able to go.\" Then I helped him in shifting his luggage from the mela to the temple, and after that, we made a plan to take a bath in the Sangam with all 5-6 devotees. (Actually, that day, one devotee came from Chowpatty, HG Subal Pran Prabhuji, for some arrangements for his congregation yatra to Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, and Ayodhya. So I was with him from morning till evening in searching for hotels for devotees who were coming in the yatra.) So we took a bath in the Sangam. After that, that devotee told me to come with him to Vrindavan, and I was like, \"How will we go on such short notice\" And he asked me at 8 pm, and the train timing was 11 pm. I told him that my parents were not allowed. So he said, \"I'll talk to them.\" But I knew that my parents were not allowed. But now your mercy started working. I don't know, but after hearing, they simply said okay, and I was shocked. The plan was made at 8 pm, and my parents were ready to allow me to board the train at 11 pm. Now, from that day, I realized, \"Without the mercy of Guru, you can't reach Vrindavan.\"\n\"THANK YOU SOO MUCH GURUMAHARAJ.\"\n\nAnd now you have also allowed me to attend the Kartik Yatra at Sri Govardhan Dham, which was my dream to serve in the kitchen with devotees, dance in kirtan which was led by you, and hear class regularly from you. And now we have also planned to come to your Vyaspuja celebration at GEV, which is called the Festival of Gratitude. And also, after your mercy, I got many services in the temple like Yamuna Aarti and deity worship. Although there are many chaos also, sometimes misunderstandings happen between devotees.\n\nSo I just want to pause here because I want to write many more also, but I think it's too long. I don't want to waste your time. If you are reading this, I just want to say an extremely big thank you to you for everything, and a huge thank you to Srila Prabhupada for giving me you as my spiritual father. \"PLEASE ACCEPT ME.\"\nTHANK YOU SOO MUCH GURUMAHARAJ.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nShashwat"

Right from your childhood, it was clear that while you were in this world, you were not of this world. The qualities of love, compassion, and humility were natural in your personality ever since you were very young. Your deep desire to find the truth led you on a journey, a journey where you not only found the purpose of your life but also helped millions of others find theirs. You faced so many hardships on this journey, including serious dangers to life, but you never stopped or thought of returning because your heart was always taking you to the place where you eternally belong � Vrindavan. Your love for Vrindavan is unparalleled, and this love and compassion have manifested in the form of GEV, giving everyone a chance to access Vrindavan dham in a way they can relate to. Year after year, in a tireless manner, you have been serving to fulfill the desire of your spiritual master, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, to spread the message of Lord Chaitanya, especially in western countries. Despite your health challenges and advancing age, your enthusiasm to share the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu never fades but only keeps growing, which is nothing but a testimony of your love and surrender to your Guru Maharaj. You are willing to give your life and soul to help devotees take up this message very seriously and surrender their lives at the lotus feet of your spiritual master. Every lecture, every instruction of yours is like an expression of your love for your Guru Maharaj and Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. This year's yatra was very special, at the foothills of Giriraj Govardhan. Your love for Vraja dham was easily seen in your kathas, as well as your interactions with Vrajavasis, who love you like one of their own. I want to express my sincerest heartfelt gratitude to you for giving us a tiny part of the love that you have for the dhamas and dhamavasis.\nI am a worthless aspiring servant of yours, and despite my so many shortcomings, I only see hope knowing your infinite compassion for all fallen souls. On this most auspicious day of your appearance, my prayers to the Lordships and Srila Prabhupada are to bestow good health and long life to you so that you keep sharing their love with the world through your instructions, your dealings, and example. I hope to be a speck of dust at your lotus feet with the only desire being to have no other desire but to serve your lotus feet.\n\nYour Aspiring Servant,\nAditya Malhotra\nDelhi"

It appeared as the greatest fortune of my life when you accepted me as a menial servant of your servants, as your unworthy disciple. I shall eternally remain indebted for your kindness, Guru Maharaj.\n\nLast year, on December 27th, after years of waiting, out of your causeless love and compassion, you finally accepted me as a servant. I wish to treasure that day, that moment, forever in the core of my heart. That day, I faced you for the first time ever. I bowed down, hesitant to look right into your eyes, and I offered my vows. While I am sure that you were all cognizant of my wretched, undeserving condition, you extended your hand to bless me with your chanted beads, while HG Radheshyam Prabhu announced my new name - Isvara Mukunda Das. You have always been as worshipable as Bhagavan for me, Guru Maharaj, and HG Radheshyam Prabhu has always been my shiksha guru, the life force in my sadhana bhakti. Nothing could have been more fortunate than to get initiation from you in his presence.\n\nFrom that day on, I am always restless. Your merciful self and my shiksha guru have done such a great favor on me. What do I do to reciprocate How do I satisfy you How do I express my love and gratitude to you, Guru Maharaj My mind is always questioning my servitude to you. I am chanting. I am reading. I am hearing. I am serving with devotees. I am preaching. Everything is an offering for your pleasure, but I lack contentment. After trying to convince me with several philosophical arguments, I am still striving to offer something tangible to satisfy you, Guru Maharaj. Indeed, a serious lack of sincerity and personal purity are undeniable causes for the same.\n\nA child�s innocence remains protected in its dependence upon the father. To please you also, I am utterly dependent upon your kindness. On this blessed day, I beg for the ability and sincerity to serve you, to please you, to satisfy you. I pray at your lotus feet, Guru Maharaj, that no distraction or disturbance may take me away from the association of your sincere servants. Let me remain loyal to your command, my master! Let me be able to fight my own conditionings and lower self with sincerity in sewa and sadhana! Let me never become forgetful of your ultimate kindness upon my lowly self. Let me never bring any disgrace to your glory or ever discourage devotees with my immaturity in dealings and personal conduct. Please protect me from shadowy motivations, Guru Maharaj. Often, the hidden lust for power, recognition, and prestige takes the garb of devotional service. May your divine example and pure teachings be my guiding light across all these dark lanes.\n\nIf it pleases you, dear Guru Maharaj, I beg for the shelter at your lotus feet life after life. Not as a parasite but as an obedient, unpretentious servant of your servants.\n\nOnce again, sincerest prayers for your health, Guru Maharaj. It is true that bodily discomforts do not affect your transcendental self, but it does pain your servants to see you go through any external health challenges just to keep us all motivated. May Sri Sri Radha Vrindavanbihari Ji bestow all of us with your merciful, ecstatic presence for eternity!\n\nYour Unworthy Servant,\nIsvara Mukunda Das"

On this occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja, I want to meditate on two of those: your unflinching loyalty to Srila Prabhupada and your emphasis on collective unity.\n\nThis year in Kartik Yatra, we saw how even some of the early disciples of Srila Prabhupada were expressing their gratitude to you for being instrumental in their lives in deepening their connection with Srila Prabhupada. This is a testimony to how you are a perfect follower of Srila Prabhupada. I have heard that in early days, Srila Prabhupada had instructed you to learn deity worship from HG Jananivas pr. When Srila Prabhupada received two instructions for his spiritual master, he created ISKCON and BBT respectively to fulfill those instructions perpetually. In one of your lectures in Kartik Yatra, when you mentioned how HG Jananivas pr is head pujari of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Temple, Chowpatty, I was thinking how you have also done something similar in pursuance of your Guru's order. On this day, Maharaj, I seek your mercy and empowerment so that I can remember, meditate upon, and follow your instructions to the best of my capacity and become your worthy disciple.\n\nWe have repeatedly heard from you the importance of staying united in the service of Srila Prabhupada. Indeed, in today's age of quarrel, hypocrisy, and disagreement (as Srila Prabhupada writes in his purports), this is going to be our most important weapon against Maya. You repeated this while describing the lila where Varun deva's servants had wrongly captured Nanda Maharaj. The vrajbasis, anxious at the shore, were united like one family. And you said, \"In a devotee community, when we say 'us' or 'we', it means we are all together, honoring and serving and respecting each other to serve Krishna. This is the meaning of keeping Krishna in the center of our community and relationships.\" Gurudev, I beg at your lotus feet, may I get strength to keep aside my false ego and cultivate a genuine service attitude towards my superiors, equals, and juniors in the mood of a humble servant of a servant.\n\nBefore the initiation ceremony of my wife, Sundari Vishakha devi dasi, in Chowpatty temple in 2012, in HG Gauranga pr's pre-brief, he mentioned how one who receives shelter of a bonafide Guru is very fortunate; one who gets to hear from such a Guru is more fortunate; and one who gets to repeatedly hear from such a Guru is most fortunate. Maharaj, I pray at your lotus feet that may I get the sincerity, desire, and determination to hear from you repeatedly and take shelter of your vani.\n\nDear Maharaj, on Srila Prabhupada's disappearance day, you ended your class by saying, \"On this day, we can remind ourselves what is important to us. Otherwise, we get distracted by so many fears and temptations of Maya.\" On this most auspicious day of your 75th Vyas Puja, Gurudev, I seek your mercy and empowerment to be able to overcome my fears and temptations and dedicate my life more and more to become a better sadhaka, better sevaka, and better sainika in the service of Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas. Thank you, Maharaj, for so patiently guiding us and showing the way for our ultimate welfare.\n\nYour aspiring servants of your servants,\nVyas Acharya das and family (wife: Sundari Vishakha devi dasi, brother: Paavan Nitai das, sister-in-law: Radhika Ruchi devi dasi, mother: Sudha Lakshmi devi dasi, father: Krishna Krida das, and children: Pradyumna, Parth, Prahlad, and Radhika)."

It is your causeless mercy that you have given shelter at your lotus feet to this rascal. Although I am an unworthy and useless disciple, still your ahaituki kripa is inconceivable and unlimited. It is impossible for even Lord Ananta to describe your glories with His unlimited hoods and mouths, so what to speak of this one tiny, insignificant fool disciple Still, I will try to share an infinitesimal drop of your glories from an infinite ocean.\n\nGurudev, your vaani have everything. All the secrets are there in your divine lectures and kirtan. The more I hear, the more it increases my love and understanding about what I have received, the highest thing in this whole cosmos. Truly, Gurudev, you are always present in your lectures and kirtans. Thank you for this special mercy and thank you for revealing the CC and SB to us. Again, Gurumaharaj, thank you, and thank you, because everything is there on those recordings. We just have to sincerely and earnestly hear you, and through them, the service attitude, humility, and approach to the Holy Name come.\nGurumaharaj, you have thousands and thousands of disciples who are so capable and sincere, and other thousands of disciples who are aspiring from you. All of them are senior and worshipable, and all are better than me. But still, I do not know why you have allowed me to be your disciple. There is no doubt; it is your causeless mercy. During this Govardhan yatra, you gave me something so special and inconceivable that I cannot even dream of it. I am afraid to share it here, but you allowed me to do that service. I do not know why, Gurumaharaj, although I do not even know how to do that service. Certainly, it is your causeless mercy, and I will be eternally grateful for this mercy and will never forget this vapu seva which I got. Thank you, and thank you.\n\nGurumaharaj, I am trying to be sincere, I am trying to be humble, I am trying to be selfless, I am trying to be simple. But Gurumaharaj, it is impossible for me unless your causeless mercy comes. Currently, I am like that insignificant, filthy, and dirty worm in the stool who wants to go so deep in sense gratification in this material world. And honestly, Gurumaharaj, I am stuck in the illusion that I will find happiness in it, and now I am always looking for name, fame, and prestige. Please, Gurumaharaj, please help me to come out from it.\n\nGurumaharaj, I have increased my vow of daily hearing your lecture to 50 minutes and daily reading Srila Prabhupada's books to 50 minutes. I do not know, Gurumaharaj, how to truly read Srila Prabhupada's books and take shelter of your lectures. Please help me so that I can honestly and genuinely hear your lectures and fully follow your instructions without any deviation. Gurumaharaj, I want to be always loyal to you, and whatever things may come, I always try to seek only through your vaani. Please bless and allow me. Gurumaharaj, I want to come back to Godhead, but unless I please and serve your instructions, this thought of going back doesn't really attract me. The only desire that comes is to go and humbly and menially serve your instructions and serve Srila Prabhupada's disciples and their disciples and make it my life and soul.\n\nGurumaharaj, you have given me some special devotees in my life. I am so happy and feel so secure in their association, and I am so thankful for that. Many times, I feel so close to you through them. And at the same time, I pray to you that please always keep me in the association of such sincere and humble devotees, and please, and really please, help me so that I could never displease and offend them and always serve them in the mood of a servant of a servant.\n\nThank you, Gurumaharaj, and from my core of my heart, thank you for everything.\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances!\nYour insignificant and unworthy servant,\nAtmarama Gauranga Das"

You have dedicated your whole entire life to Srila Prabhupada and his mission, and you continue to serve him and, while doing so, move millions of hearts. Mine happens to be one of those.\n\nI am still clueless what I'm trying to say � maybe this is my way of reaching out to your lotus feet. Thinking of serving Krishna is a far-fetched reality for me.

But in my heart, I'm already your menial servant, and I will always try to remember your words and follow them to benefit from your true association and live a life that is favorable and pleasing to you.\n\nI will strive for perfection in each of my services and strive to serve and please all the Vaishnavas and preach this glorious mission as much as I can with all the ability I have. You would love to see the qualities of humility and tolerance in your servant; I can't cultivate them on my own, but I will surely beg to attain them, and beg that this verse, �td api suncena taror iva sahiun, amnin mnadena krtanya sad hari,� is the foundation of my life. I might fail, but I won't ever stop trying to chant attentively in the right mood.\n\nI don't trust myself enough to promise all this, but I can say that I will try my best.\nI have nothing else to offer, Maharaj Ji, please accept this.\nPlease accept me.\n\nYour eternal servant."

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your holy lotus feet.\nRecently, I gave a brahmachari class at Sri Sri Radha Kunjabihari temple where we discussed the four symptoms of envy: comparing, competing, complaining, and criticizing. Later, a thought came to my mind that you desire strongly that all your disciples become pure devotees in this very life and go back home, back to Goloka Vrindavan. For that, we, disciples, need to be free from envy, which has those four symptoms. So, in the beginning itself, before accepting anyone as your disciple, you ensure that they are considerably free from envy by being free from these four things. How do you ensure this By not giving diksha immediately! As the years pass by, a candidate will compare himself with his other devotee friends, who will take initiation from some other gurus in ISKCON. He needs to become free from envy by not comparing himself with his friends. He cannot compete with them, as he is not initiated; he cannot complain to his counselor or seniors. He cannot criticize anyone. Even if he does that, he cannot get initiation immediately. Thus, by allowing five to ten years to pass by, you ensure that the candidate is free from envy to a great extent. Excellent technique, Guru Maharaj, you are a genius indeed!\nAlthough Guru Maharaj, you initiated me in 1998, I am not yet free from envy, so please shower your more intense mercy upon this fallen soul and purify me quickly. I can only repeat the words of Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur:\ngurudeva!\nkp-bindu diy, koro� ei dse\ntpekh ati hna\nsakala-sahane, bolo diy koro\nnija mne sph-hna\nGurudeva, give to this servant just one drop of mercy. I am lower than a blade of grass. Give me all help. Give me strength. Let me be as you are, without desires or aspirations.\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for your unlimited kindness upon me. There are no words with me to thank you enough!\nYour fallen disciple,\nSundarshyam das.\nISKCON Pune, NVCC.\n11th November, 2025."

But your life is filled with examples. In every situation, you were looking for the essence behind it. Your friend's untimely death because his car skidded�you pondered about the uncertainty of life. Proposal from Irene�you contemplated the path led by great souls throughout history. Just sitting on the bank of the Ganges, you learned so much, without a single lecture or class, because of your hunger to see the essence behind it. Deadly passage of Istanbul, one night with a mongoose�just by reading that incident, one can feel horrified, but you were so grateful to the mongoose for teaching you patience. After one month of fasting, when you were about to break your fast, one monkey jumped and took away everything. A few peanuts fell, but another monkey came and not even a single nut was spared. Anyone can feel frustrated at such an incident, but you saw such a beautiful lesson: Material acquisitions are like peanuts in comparison to the spiritual treasure. How in material life people are lying, crying, and dying for a few of those peanuts� and there are endless examples in \"Journey Home.\" Every situation became an opportunity to deepen your spiritual wisdom and strengthen your connection with Krishna. Thank you, Guru Mahrja, for teaching by your example how to look for the essence in every situation. I beg at your lotus feet to bless me with strength to cultivate such spiritual vision, so that I don't get carried away by external situations but can seek the essence, learn the lesson, and gratefully thank Krishna in every situation.\n\nys,\nAdishyam Das"

You are an ocean of mercy, a storm of blessings, and the very embodiment of humility, compassion, and unconditional love.\n\nOnce, when Srila Ramanujacharya asked Kuresh to take darshan of Sri Ranganath Swami, Kuresh replied, �I have already taken darshan, for my Ranganath stands before me.� In the same spirit�not out of imitation or pride, but from my heart without duplicity�I can humbly say that you are my Radha-Gopinath.

Just as you once told Srila Prabhupada, �My life is dedicated to you,� I too wish to dedicate this entire life to your service. Krishna has kindly given us a little freedom, but today I offer even that freedom to you. Everything I have is already yours; now I have nothing left to call my own.\n\nI may not yet know Sri Sri Radha-Gopinath directly, but I know the path of Guru Parampara that leads to them. My only wish is to follow your footsteps and the footsteps of all our acharyas, until the day I attain Radha-Krishna prema.\n\nGurudev, I have committed many aparadhas, but I am not hopeless. I only beg for your mercy to purify me and help me become a true devotee. Your qualities are divine and beyond imitation, yet I pray for the strength to reflect even a drop of your compassion and humility in my character. You are a valiant soldier of His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada, and every action of yours reminds the world of his instructions and his mission.\n\nPlease keep me always under the shade of your lotus feet. I hold tightly to them, for they are my only refuge.

Without it, I cannot survive even a moment.\n\nO Gurudev, I thirst for just one drop of your mercy. You know all my weaknesses�my lack of taste for japa, my absence of seva-bhava, and my deficiency of love for Sri Sri Radha-Gopinath. But one thing I possess gives me hope�my unbroken faith in you. I know that by sincerely surrendering to you and striving my best, one day I will attain everything.\n\nI promise to try my utmost to chant my sixteen rounds with full attention, to serve consciously, to remember you and Radha-Gopinath in all my actions, and to remain sensitive and harmonious with all Vaishnavas. I will do my best to please my authorities, avoid prajalpa, and stay away from anything that may displease you or hinder my bhakti.\n\nWhatever offenses I have committed in the past, I beg for your forgiveness at your lotus feet.

My humble prostrated obeisances at the lotus feet of the most worshipable Radhanath Swami Maharaj.\nMy first opportunity to meet Maharaj happened because of my brother, Rohini Tanay Das, who was a brahmachari at Govind Dham, Nigdi. Due to cancer, he left for the Bhagavat Dham on 2/3/2011. A person absorbed in Krishna consciousness does not consider death to be important; he feels joy, knowing he is going back to his real mother and father. I learned from him how to say this and how to face intense pain with a smile.\nOn the 14th, during the Pran Pratishtha of Sri Sri Radha Radhagovindaji, we were standing in the temple when Phulsangi Mataji met us. She asked, �Did you meet Maharaj� We said, �No� how can we meet him� She then held my hand and, cutting through the crowd, took us to where Maharaj was, because he was about to leave. �Come, I will take you to meet him,� she said.\nAll of us followed her to the place where Maharaj was standing. When she told Maharaj, �These are Rohini Tanay�s parents, sister and brother,� Maharaj embraced my father tightly. That moment was unforgettable. Even before that, through Rohini Tai, I had already accepted Maharaj as my Guru and had heard so much about Maharaj from Rohini Tanay. After seeing him personally, I was overwhelmed � on one side, the grief of my brother, and on the other side, the satisfaction of receiving the direct darshan of my Guru Maharaj. No one spoke anything; everyone was speaking through their eyes.\nFrom that day on, I decided that Maharaj would be my Guru. Later, while standing in the prasadam line, someone placed a photo of Maharaj in my mother�s hand. She gave the photo to me saying, �What will I do with this photo You chant on beads, you keep it.� At that moment, I understood that everything was Krishna�s arrangement. I took the photo, and since then I have been sharing every happiness and sorrow with Maharaj. In many unseen ways, he has guided me, and the result of that is that I am trying to follow the verse from Maharaj�s many lectures � the verse from Chaitanya Shikshashtakam: �Trinad api sunichena, taror iva sahishnuna�� Although I am not qualified, I am offering my efforts to such a divine Guru like Maharaj.\nMany difficulties came, but Maharaj helped me remain steady and patient in bhakti. May Maharaj be blessed with a long and healthy life, and may he, full of compassion and mercy, always remain joyful for the sake of all devotees.\nIf anything wrong or inappropriate has been spoken out of enthusiasm, kindly forgive this servant."

All glories to you, and all glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nOn this sacred occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja, my heart overflows with gratitude and remembrance. I am reflecting on those golden days of my childhood at the Matunga program, when you would shower everyone with your warm, affectionate hugs. Those moments were filled with a sweetness and purity that words can hardly capture.\nI still remember how lovingly you would tap or punch my forehead. It always felt like a �reset button� that instantly cleared all my worries. And when you would wrap me in your saffron shawl, though nothing else was visible, it felt as if I was completely protected, sheltered under your love and care.\nAs children, we didn�t realize the immense fortune we had of being in your presence, receiving your blessings. We were too absorbed in our little games of cricket, not recognizing that the greatest treasure of our lives was right before us. Now, as I look back, I realize how precious those moments were, a golden opportunity that I did not value enough then.\nI also feel deeply grateful for the mercy you have showered upon my parents and sister. Whatever little spiritual inclination and values I have today are only because of the association and guidance you have so kindly given to them. You have not only transformed their hearts but also given our entire family a purpose and direction centered around Krishna. The care and compassion you have shown to them over the years is something I can never repay.\nOver the years, so many things have changed in ways I could have never imagined. This year�s Kartik Yatra I attended after 11 long years, which felt like a forgotten blessing returning to life. There was a time when I couldn�t even think of missing a single Yatra, and would attend all Sunday programs in a year at the temple, and now, even to attend one in a year feels like a rare and precious gift.\nToday, I feel deeply unfortunate to be living away from your heart, Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji, and to be deprived of your direct mercy. Yet, as you have taught us, I continue to have faith that somehow, by following your instructions, I may be of some use in Srila Prabhupada�s divine mission. Your teachings, your example, and your compassion constantly inspire me to stay steady on the spiritual path and not to deviate, no matter how challenging life becomes.\nI am also very grateful for the kindness and inspiration you have shown to my wife, Kirti Sundari Devi Dasi, and our daughter, Vrindapriya. Whatever little harmony and spiritual strength we have in our family is purely by your grace. You have given us the understanding that family life can also be centered around devotion, service, and gratitude. I pray that our home may always remain connected to your lotus feet and that we may serve your mission together with sincerity and humility.\nWe hanker for your darshan like the chataka bird hankers for the pure raindrops from the sky, with the same intense longing and hope. On this auspicious day, I sincerely pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji to bless you with strong health, vitality, and endless strength to continue spreading the divine message of Lord Krishna, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Srila Prabhupada to the world.\nAnd, Gurudev, I have one small, childlike prayer: please, at least once a year, bless me with one of your loving hugs. That single embrace has the power to dissolve all my suffering and remind me that I am forever under your shelter.\n\nAwaiting for the drop of your mercy and that loving hug,\n\nYour eternal servants,\nKumar Sundar Das, Kirti Sundari Devi Dasi, & Vrindapriya"

Please accept my most humble obeisances in the dust of your divine lotus feet.\n\nIt is a great pleasure and honor to have this opportunity to write an offering for your 75th year of most auspicious presence on this earthly plane. Writing an offering for you is like showing a lamp to the sun; though we know that our feeble attempt is bound to fall short, still the attempt to glorify and remember you is so joyful and enlivening that we cannot desist from it and are drawn to try.\n\nDear Maharaj, no words can properly glorify your deep, powerful, and impactful personality or properly express the impact that you have created in empowering, cajoling, and inspiring so many of us to pursue the only goal that will actually satisfy our parched souls - humble and loving service to the Supreme Divinity.\n\nI am very grateful for your presence amongst us in this time and age when the influence of Kaliyuga is permeating very thick and deep in our lives with powerful forces attempting to distract, deviate, and degrade from meaningful purpose to sensual gratification driven by profit-driven enterprises through smartphones, social media, and similar forces. Amidst all of these disruptive forces, your presence is a soothing calm for us, your disciples and well-wishers. It enables us to fight against these opposing forces (within and without) and, following in your footsteps, continue with a firm determination towards the only goal that will quench our eternal thirst.\n\n\"If you don't have anything in your life that you are ready to die for, you have nothing worth living for.\" This statement of yours has become a guiding light of my life, and it encourages me every day.

One among them that you have so amazingly exemplified is the unworldly example of cooperation, service, and taking everyone together in service to Srila Prabhupada. Your heart-warming qualities, deeply affectionate and humble comforting nature, and well-wishing empathy for others make you attractive and endearing for one and all - not only your disciples and students but also your godbrothers, seniors, other Vaishnavas from all sampradayas, and even those who may not be directly interested in spiritual life but are just onlooking bystanders. No one whose path has crossed you can resist the attraction to your pure personality, your child-like innocence and laughter, your deep sage-like composure, and your harmless, unimposing, yet profoundly powerful personality full of love and compassion for others and completely in alignment with the revealed instructions.\n\nOn this auspicious day, I would like to thank you for all the mercy that you have bestowed upon me directly through all the arrangements that you have made and the devotees whom you have inspired and instructed to act for others' welfare. The most recent and important devotee among them is dear Adi Gadadhar Prabhu, who is most attached to you and in whose person we can feel the impact of your love and in whose association, we feel the warmth of your devotion and compassion.

So, you always show how to be in the mood of a servant of the servant, and with humility, you are so eager to serve. I am eternally grateful to you, Maharaj, that you have accepted someone like me as your disciple.\n\nWhen I read your *Journey Home* book, I came to know how determined and tolerant you are to find Krishna and to find a genuine spiritual master in your life. Your journey to India also taught me how, in every situation, we understand that there is something to be learned and how to always see the hand of God in all situations of life.\n\nYour taste for chanting of the holy name is something that I always aspire for. You always carry your beads wherever you go and, without wasting any time, you are constantly chanting.\n\nPlease bless me, Maharaj, so that I can get some of your divine qualities like empathy, tolerance, and compassion for others.

Although I am unqualified to even try to describe your ocean of glories, but remembering your causeless mercy upon this insignificant servant, I will make a humble attempt. Maharaj, your life is a perfect example of how to be a perfect disciple. Although you are a self-realized soul, you never miss hearing from Srila Prabhupada even a single day. Your deep love and affection for your spiritual master reflect in your every word and action. You have given great importance in restoring and renovating places related to Srila Prabhupada�s pastimes. Starting from the renovation of Srila Prabhupada�s birthplace at Kathaltala, his first meeting place with Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur at 1, Ultadanga Junction Road, to the renovation of 26th 2nd Ave in New York, where Prabhupada started this movement, all these indicate how deeply you want to establish Srila Prabhupada in each and every devotee�s heart. This teaches me how I should strive to glorify you and Srila Prabhupada with all my actions.\n\nLike a true acharya, you always teach by your own example. You teach us how to strive for being a true servant of the servant of those who are genuinely serving Krishna. The way you deal with every single living entity shows your intense love for Krishna. You have deep love and attachment to our previous acharyas as well. Hearing about Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His associates from your lotus mouth acts as a shower of nectar in my dry heart. During the 2004 Bangladesh yatra, you gave a 6-hour long lecture on the life of Srila Narottam Das Thakur Mahashaya. Maharaj, I can never forget that lecture. After hearing the glorious pastimes of Narottam Dasa Thakur, Srinivas Acharya, Narahari Sarkar and other exalted Vaishnavas from your lotus mouth, when we visited Srikhanda, Jajigram and Katwa earlier this year, it was spiritually extremely nourishing. Recently I was hearing a lecture by HG Vraja Vihari Prabhu where he was mentioning that the primary thing you expect from your disciples is to have deep absorption in hearing and chanting. You always want us to focus on quality rather than quantity. I beg forgiveness Maharaj that I could not meet your expectations so far. Please bless me Guru Maharaj so that I can please you by sincere sadhana, by serving the Vaishnavas, co-operating with them in every endeavor and striving for pleasing Srila Prabhupada and Krishna with all my actions. I pray for your good health. May the whole world keep on getting your divine mercy through your vani and vapu like this.\n\nYour humble servant,\nAnanta Vallabha Das"

You gave your very best, in every situation, gratefully accepting with humility, all kinds of tribulations that came your way.\n\nUnderstanding Shrila Prabhupad�s heart, you have given us what he had envisioned to establish in society. Schools based on Vedic culture, Vrindavan in the form of Goverdhan Eco Village, Bhakti Vedanta Hospital, the Bhakti Vedanta Hospice, midday meal programs, and so many other schemes, where, along with the body, the soul is also nourished.\n\nYou have shown us by your example, how one should surrender to the will and instructions of one's spiritual master.\n\nWhere preaching is concerned, you have actually expanded the concept of preaching to extraordinary dimensions, through your disciples.\nRight from establishing the counseling system for the devotee community, conducting valued education classes in schools, preaching to the youth, preaching to the corporate sector, preaching in villages, preaching internationally, preaching on social media... today ISKCON has become a household name, thanks to your visionary thinking and efforts in that direction.\n\nYou have given us the essence of Scriptures through your books and lectures, and these are our real shelter as we navigate ourselves through life�s difficult turns.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I have received so much from you in terms of spiritual wealth, much, much more than I can ever repay in this lifetime.\nI have so many shortcomings and am most unqualified in so many ways.

You travelled to every corner of India. During that time you met different types of Gurus, each shining with their own light of knowledge. At such a young age you spent time with all kinds of Gurus, whether happily or painfully, but you never accepted anyone as your Guru; you neither disrespected anyone nor pointed out anyone's mistakes. You respected everyone from the heart, saw their good qualities, and learnt something or the other from them.\n\nBut when the time came, you chose Shrila Prabhupada as your Gurudev. And from then till today, you are following his instructions; the ideal of how to become a devoted disciple is before us. You not only loved Srila Prabhupada but you also give so much respect to his disciples and your God brothers and God sisters that they too feel overwhelmed while receiving your respect and honour.\n\nGurudev, you are a storehouse of love and humility. You give the same love in abundance to living beings like us. That is why today we all are here. You keep showering your love on us and you become very happy seeing us happy.\n\nGurudev, a small example is when you take us on a Yatra, you make arrangements for our every happiness and at the end of the day when you conduct Hari Naam Sankirtan in the pandal, you cry out to Krishna, and we just shout after you. But not seeing any of our shortcomings, you become very happy, and seeing that, we also feel very happy.\n\nGurudev, in today's Kalyug, whoever makes someone a Guru, the Guru keeps changing. But on this holy day, give me a drop of your Guru loyalty and devotion as alms, so that till the last breath of my life, I remain dedicated to your lotus feet and remain engaged in service under the guidance of the devotees.\n\nsakti-buddhi-hin, ami ati din, koro� more atma-satha\nThank you very much\nYour unworthy servant\nKrishna Leela Devi Dasi."

I am always inspired by your deep humility, especially the pastime where you wrote \"das\" in a register where others mentioned their positions.\n\nLast year was wonderful. I was humbled by how you used us as instruments to bring so many more souls to the mission. I could clearly see the hands of Krsna and intelligence being supplied by the parampara to take right decisions, and many innovations and on-ground decisions in our outreach, and 8 boys have agreed to stay in VOICE.

This is because of your caring and loving nature, ecstatic kirtans and wonderful lectures; the beautiful glance and attractive smile of Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji and the wonderful devotees trained by you, that people are attracted to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Temple.\nIn the early years, you visited homes of devotees, brought devotees together in pandal programs, which was a regular feature on Saturdays, taught devotees to dance in kirtan and immersed them in the holy name and in katha. It is our good fortune that you chose to be in India.\nI love to read your quotes; there is so much to learn from these simple lines. I am just making a mention of some of them:\n\n1. All virtues have their origin in gratitude.\n2. Actual gratitude is the symptom of humility.\n3. A happy devotee is the best preacher, and better than that is a temple full of happy devotees.\n4. Definition of love is the capacity to forgive endlessly.\n5. With faith, you can see the invisible, you can believe the incredible, and you can receive the impossible.\n6. Gold is the most malleable because it has the least resistance. If we reduce our resistance in Krishna's service, the current of Krishna's mercy will easily flow through our hearts.\n7. Caring for each other, with patience, tolerance, and humility, is part of what is meant to walk a spiritual path.\n8. Before we judge others, we must remember that the faults we perceive in them are likely to be the effect of circumstances, the psychological response to trauma, abuse, rejection, heartbreak, insecurity, pain, confusion, or disease.\n\nThe last quote, which I have mentioned, shows how keenly you have observed and deeply studied human nature, and how very compassionate you are.\nThank you, Maharaj, for your mercy, compassion, and kindness.

Through your life of unwavering surrender to Srila Prabhupada and your deep love for Krishna, you have illuminated the path of bhakti for countless lost souls, including myself.\n\nYour every action reflects selflessness, humility, and an unending desire to serve. You have shown that spiritual life is not merely a set of practices but truly a journey back to our real home � the eternal abode of Lord Krishna.\n\nAs a housewife and mother navigating family responsibilities, I constantly draw strength and inspiration from your teachings. You have taught us that every act of service, however small, becomes an offering of devotion when done with sincerity and full consciousness of Krishna.\n\nYour compassion, endless patience, and personal example of living for others have been my guiding light.\n\nYour humorous yet deeply impactful way of communication always touches hearts. Once, when a devotee said he could not attend yatra because he did not have �leaves� from his office, you lovingly handed him some dry leaves and said, �Here are the leaves.�\nSuch simplicity, warmth, and wisdom reflect your divine nature � teaching profound lessons with a gentle smile.\n\nYour surrender to Srila Prabhupada and complete dedication to Lord Krishna constantly remind me of the true purpose of human life � to serve the Lord and His devotees with love and devotion. You have transformed hearts not merely by your words but through your personal example of purity, forgiveness, and deep spiritual insight.\n\nOn this sacred occasion, I pray for your continued health, strength, and divine presence so that you may keep inspiring the world with your matchless compassion.\n\nPlease, Guru Maharaj, bless me that I may follow your instructions faithfully and serve in a way that brings even a small happiness to your heart and contributes to Srila Prabhupada�s glorious mission.\n\nWith deep gratitude and affection,\n\nYour insignificant servants,\nNimisha Agrawal\nMukund Agrawal (Son, 10 yrs.)\nIshaan Agrawal (Son, 8 yrs.)"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaja,\nIn one of Raghunatha Dasa Gosvami�s most extolled prayers to his Guru Maharaja, he says,\nnama-srestham manum api saci-putram atra svarupam\nRupam tasyagrajam uru-purim mathurim gostavatim\nRadha-kundam giri-varam aho radhika-madhavasam\nprapto yasya prathita-krpaya sri gurum tam nato� smi\n�I am fully indebted to Sri Gurudeva. Why He has given me a profound conception of the holy name of Krishna which\ncontains the phenomenal sound which contains the highest form of thought, aspiration, ideal, and everything. The name\nKrishna is enchanting and most sensational�the sum and substance of everything.\n\nAnd then he says, �He has given me service of that great radiant savior, the son of mother Saci, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu\nwho is like a golden mountain standing and magnanimously emphasizing the stupendous lilas of Radha and Krishna. And\nGurudeva has brought me to the lotus feet of Mahaprabhu�s most intimate assistant, Svarupa Damodara, who is the\nrepresentation of Lalita devi, who is the most favorite friend of Radhika.\n\nThen he has got me in connection with Sri Rupa, who was ordered to distribute the most fascinating kinds of devotional rasas�\nRaganuga bhakti. Raghunatha Dasa Gosvami further says, then by his grace I have achieved the association of Srila Sanatana Gosvami\nwho adjusts our position in relation to raganuga bhakti and gives us �Sambandha jnana.�\n\nThen he says, �Gurudeva has given me Mathura Mandala where Radha and Govinda have Their most intimate, loving, and most sweet\npastimes. Everything animate and inanimate helps me in my remembrance of Radha and Govinda. All this I have received from my\nGurudeva. By living in Vrindavana with the Vrajavasis, I am becoming acquainted with their association and their feelings of love for\nKrishna. By the grace of Gurudeva, I have become acquainted with Radha Kund, the favorite place of Radha and Govinda for their\nmost intimate pastimes, and this great Govardhana. He has given me hope that one day I can eternally render Them service, so\nI bow my head with all my respects to the lotus feet of my Gurudeva.�\n\nSo, if we are conscious of all these spiritual masters, then we have approached our Gurudeva properly.\nKrishna says, �Those who try to worship Me directly are not real devotees. Real devotees are those who are devoted to My devotees.\nWe can see Mount Everest from afar. But to approach Mount Everest, we must pass through so many closer mountain peaks.\nSo when we say that our connection is with Krishna alone, then we are far off.\nIf we are to actually approach the king, we must approach him through his entourage.\n\nSo, Guru is the divine messenger of immortal hope and joy in this mortal and miserable world. His advent is the most auspicious and\nhappy event.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Sri Rupa and Raghunatha Dasa and the previous acharyas, he is persistently revealing to us the holy\nabode of the Lord and His most loving pastimes with His devotees. We all perceived this during our Govardhana yatra this time.\nIn the Srimad Bhagavatam are beautiful prayers which say that, �The devotee whose heart has been completely cleansed by the process\nof devotional service and who is favored by bhakti devi does not become bewildered by the external energy of the Lord, which is like a\ndeep, dark well. Being completely cleansed of all material contaminations in this way, he is very easily able\nto understand Your pastimes. I therefore beg Your Lordship to bless me by the association of Your devotees who are completely purified\nby worshiping Your lotus feet and are so merciful and compassionate on the fallen conditioned souls. I think that Your real benediction\nwill be to allow me to associate with such devotees.\n\nDear Gurudeva, please allow me to be the servant of the servant of Your devotees.\nThank you very much.\nHis Holiness Radhanatha Swami ki jay!\nJagad guru Srila Prabhupada ki jay!"

Although formal initiation is still quite far away, informally you have initiated me with your instructions a year ago, during the last Kartik Yatra in Mayapur (2024).\n\nYour love towards Srila Prabhupada, all your Godbrothers, all devotees, Vrindavan, and the jivas � whether they are conscious or unconscious � made me relish a drop of nectar from the spiritual world while living in the perishable material world. Your �vani� blossoms my heart with joy and makes me forget the miseries of life, at least for the time being. Your instructions empower me to remain protected from maya and to serve the devotees. My Guru Maharaj, I am very, very indebted to you.\n\nJust now, during this Kartik Yatra of Govardhan (2025), I have received some of your instructions coming in line via some senior devotees. I am striving to live by and implement those instructions throughout my life. I am mentioning them here so that I may receive the blessings of all the Vaishnavas to help me follow them sincerely:\n\n1. Please go deep into chanting, hearing, and service.\n2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Krishna.\n3. Strive to be united as a community.\n4. Practice enthusiasm to share Bhakti - Krishna Consciousness.\n5. Never forget that Bhakti is not about quantity or numbers, but it is about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n\nMy Guru Maharaj, I humbly seek your blessings so that I can follow your instructions throughout my life. As you have mentioned, by following your instructions, I can offer you the best gift on your birthday.\n\nAlso, Guru Maharaj, I am struggling to cultivate the mood of �td api su-ncena taror iva sahiun amnin mna-dena krtanya sad harih�. At present, due to my diseased condition and the anarthas of my heart and mind, I find it difficult to overcome lust and ego. But I have full faith that I have come to the best doctor � one who can cure me and implant the love for devotees and, therefore, the Lord Hari.\n\nI am praying at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Govinda Dev Ji, Srila Prabhupada, and all the Vaishnavas, that they bless you with good health and long life so that your presence and words may continue to purify the millions of hearts and guide them back home, back to Godhead.\n\nOnce again, Guru Maharaj, I offer my deepest gratitude to you and to Srila Prabhupada for giving meaning to this short life.\n\nYour Insignificant Servant\nRanjeet"

How you appreciate your god-brothers and sisters, disciples. How patiently you look into the eyes of all devotees when you walk through the pandal.

Even in this advanced age, you continue to bless us daily � joining the morning programs, chanting japa with us, and offering your deep classes every evening during Kartik Yatra for our spiritual nourishment.\n\nI was deeply moved when I saw Your Holiness absorbed in prayers before Sri Giriraj Ji. That sacred moment reminded me of your beautiful statement:\n\n> �Bhakti means to observe.�\n\nToday, my heart also travels back to 2020, when we had planned to celebrate H.H. Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaj�s 75th Vyasa Puja in Surat. But the world changed then, and we lost his divine association during the pandemic. Though I am your disciple, I was fortunate to have received so many opportunities to associate with His Holiness Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaj. That loss was heavy on my heart.\n\nNow, by the Lord�s mercy, I am again blessed to witness a 75th Vyasa Puja � yours. In your presence, I feel the same warmth and compassion that I once felt with Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaj. Whenever I see you, I remember him; and when I saw him, I often remembered you. Truly, this is my great fortune.\n\nJust as one beholds a ripe mango and instantly remembers its sweetness, juiciness, and taste, in the same way, when one sees you, it is felt that you are filled with pure devotion for Sri Sri Radha-Krishna. And whoever associates with you begins to feel that divine love awaken in their own hearts.\n\nDuring Kartik Yatra, in your presence, my restless heart found calm and fullness that words cannot express.\n\nYet, Maharaj, as I look at the world today, I see so many wars, conflicts, natural disasters, and an endless storm of technology pulling hearts away from Krishna. Everything is becoming refined outwardly, but our inner connection to the Lord is fading. We appear to practice bhakti, yet often without true urgency or dependence on Krishna. Only your shelter, your mercy, can save me from this illusion.\n\nLast year, on 17th September, you kindly awarded me saffron cloth. Please bless me that I may remain truly humble, for I feel that since wearing this sacred colour, some pride has quietly entered my heart � a desire for respect and honour. But you have always taught that saffron is not for prestige, but for service, sacrifice, and dedication to Srila Prabhupada�s mission.\n\nI pray, dear Maharaj, please bless me to maintain the dignity of this dress, to stay far from the traps of lust and honour, and to develop a small drop of real taste for the Holy Name.\n\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for carrying us all with your compassion and patience. May I always remain at your lotus feet, aspiring only to serve.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nAnand Vraj Das"

By your causeless mercy, I am able to chant the holy name, hear Krishna�s pastimes, and serve the Lord.\n\nAlthough I am not able to follow your instructions perfectly, I sincerely try to follow them to the best of my ability. After years of practicing Krishna consciousness, I have come to understand that the life and soul of a disciple lies in following the instructions of Gurudev. I am eternally grateful to you for making the practice of devotional service so easily accessible to everyone�through your lectures, your personal example, your wonderful dealings, your behavior, your loving mood, and your determination to follow Srila Prabhupada.\nI remember during the Puri Yatra lecture you said that the perfection of life is to follow in the footsteps of the mahajanas, the great souls. Srila Prabhupada is one such great soul who came to teach us how to live a life of bhakti�how to eat, how much to sleep, how to keep ourselves clean, how to chant, read, and hear. Practically everything needed to perfect our lives and return home, back to Godhead, was taught by Srila Prabhupada.\nGurudev, you are truly following in the footsteps of Srila Prabhupada, teaching the same principles to all your disciples. You have also created such a wonderful association of sincere devotees, and I am eternally grateful to you for that. By your causeless mercy, not only I, but all devotees, can get association with wonderful Vaishnavas, practice bhakti under their guidance, receive all kinds of help, and progress in devotional lives.\n\nAlthough I have not been hearing your lectures regularly, from this day onward I promise to you: every day, without fail, I will listen to your lectures�for that will be my way of being in your association.\n\nThank you so much for your causeless mercy and blessings.\n\nYour humble servant of servants,\nSri Krishna Govinda Das"

    "Your Offering": "Respected Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your Lotus sweet.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada &\nAll Glories to you.\n\nOn this auspicious day of your appearance, I think or contemplate two of your qualities which really touch my heart. First, your absorption in Krishna � chanting His holy name, speaking about Krishna, doing kirtan, or cooking for Krishna (on the occasion of Govardhan puja in Kartik Yatras or Srila Prabhupada�s disappearance days). And second is your broad-mindedness in serving Krishna and spreading the mission of Lord Chaitanya far & wide.\nYou repeatedly instruct me to always do all the services in great absorption, seriousness & sincerity. You not only just instruct me but personally demonstrate how to do Japa attentively by personally coming for chanting with devotees in the temple hall or in the Pandal during Kartik Yatras. From a material viewpoint, your physical body is quite old (75 years age), but still, you sit on the ground near Tulasi Maharani with your back straight and chant the holy name with great eagerness & attention. This is very instructive to me. How I also should increase my eagerness & concentration in Japa. While speaking Krishna Katha, you always maintain the balance of narrating the pastimes with great details at the same time giving lessons at appropriate times with appropriate stories or day-to-day examples. You become so much absorbed while giving a lecture by your sitting posture with a straight back & not even drinking water for hours together.\nRegarding the second quality of being broad-minded in spreading Lord Chaitanya�s movement. Although you are always focused on reaching new people through various outreach programs, you also have a keen concern for maintaining the spiritual & devotional aspects in cooking for all the devotees (I heard that you personally taste & check all the preparations), attending to the needs of Varishtha Vaishnavas, children, matajis, grihasthas, brahmacharies, foreign-bodied devotees, other sampradaya devotees & maintaining the cleanliness of the premises where our programs are held. You personally visit all the departments and supervise & give instructions for improvement in a gentle and non-pressurizing way but a persuasive way. You are also a silent fundraiser. Without applying pressure on your disciples, you inspire them to donate voluntarily and happily.\nI pray at your lotus feet that may I imbibe these qualities more in my personal life and come up to the standard which you expect from your ideal disciple to exhibit.\nYour unworthy disciple,\nRam Nitai Das, ISKCON NVCC, Pune."

But I am always thinking of how I can serve there. I will take a vow that I will restart the service very soon.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, a humble request: please take care of your health. We need your guidance for many, many years. I will pray to Lord Narsimhadev to always take care of your health and pray to Lord Shri Radha Vrindavan Bihari to shower all their mercy and give you so much strength that you develop GEV in a much, much bigger way and deliver many, many fallen souls.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I am an insignificant soul, entangled with so many material things, knowingly or unknowingly making many mistakes and many offenses.

This is a special 75th birthday; however, you always say that we can please you by practicing Krishna consciousness, by wearing the verse of �Trinad api sunicena�� and a proper service attitude to all people in this world. Thank you for your easy accessibility through your vani � association, which will not just give one liberation from this material world but infuse one with �Krishna prema�. As mother Devahuti laments for not utilizing the association of Kardama Muni, which gives liberation from material bondage, I am reflecting in my life that I am getting so many opportunities to associate with yourself and other devotees; however, I am not utilizing those opportunities but am just attached to how I can take care of my parents, wasting so much valuable time which cannot be gained by any amount of wealth. As you always say, time is so precious, and the moment we waste without the association of devotees and glorifying Krishna cannot be brought back at any cost.\nMy only desire in life is to please you and your representatives by service and be an instrument in some way or other in the mission of Lord Chaitanya. Please bless me on this most auspicious day to have this consciousness throughout my life and not get diverted to material conditionings.\nThank you very much for showing us through your example to be in Vrindavan consciousness always. How you used to meditate on Vrindavan pastimes before honoring prasadam, how you keep the bus party van name as �Vrinda-van,� you created Vrindavan forest in a dumping yard and Gowardhan Eco Village, which is nondifferent from Vrindavan. Last weekend, one mataji from Mumbai came to GEV and she wanted to visit Barasana temple in Vrindavan forest, and after visiting Barasana temple, she got very much satisfied, and her lifelong dream came true. Thank you, Maharaj, for showing your personal care for every person on earth to uplift their consciousness towards Krishna.\nI will pray towards Krishna for your long and healthy life.

I missed getting the garland from you as my mother-in-law suffered a mild heart attack at that time, and so we rushed to our modest hotel on Grand Road! I was really very low and sad! It was my first Yatra with you, Gurudev, and also my first time at Jagannath Puri!\nI was very nervous, too, thinking how I would manage for the next few days, and suddenly there was a knock on my hotel room door!\nWhen I opened the door, you were standing there with two other Brahmacharis! I was so shocked that I forgot to pay my obeisances to you! Then I got to know you wanted to take a bath, and I was the only devotee in that hotel at that point in time! I gladly welcomed you into the room!\nAfter your bath and when you were ready to leave, you gave us the garland and also a very big, special smile! All my nervousness and sadness vanished immediately, and the rest of the Yatra went off very well! My mother-in-law also recovered quickly, attended the Yatra without any further problem, and thoroughly enjoyed participating in all the kirtans, hearing all the classes, and enthusiastically visiting every place/temple/kund wherever you, Gurudev, made us visit!

King and Dylan�s strains.\n\"Within You, Without You,\" he would sigh,\nGeorge�s sitar opened the sky.\n\nHe heard the cry of Old Man River,\nFelt the blues in his young heart shiver.\nFrom Johnny Rivers' soulful plea,\n�Look to your soul��thus turned the key.\n\nAt fourteen years, he walked the halls\nOf Deerfield High with hidden calls.\nBut classrooms could not hold his mind �\nThe world was vast; truth undefined.\n\nTo Florida�s warmth his journey led,\nBut not for leisure, fame, or bread.\nAt Miami Dade, he felt the fire,\nA restless spark, a sacred desire.\n\nHe left the West, he crossed the seas,\nThrough trials, jungles, and disease.\nAt every turn, his soul was tried �\nYet grace unseen was by his side.\n\nAnd then at last, he found his home,\nNot built by hands, not carved from stone �\nBut nestled in a cowherd�s sacred land,\nWhere dust and love go hand in hand.\n\nHis heart embraced the Vraja ways,\nThe Brajvss� love, their simple praise.\nFor every cow, and bird, and tree �\nHe weeps in Vndvan�s memory.\n\nHis hands so soft, his vows so strong,\nIn japa's depth he dwells lifelong.\nHis sdhan, a blazing fire,\nHis humility � never to retire.\n\nAmong godbrothers, hand in hand,\nHe bows with love, he helps them stand.\nWith folded palms and lowered eyes,\nHe sees their glories, never tries\nTo rise above � he stoops to serve,\nWith all the honor they deserve.\n\nO Gurudeva, kind and wise,\nYou see the soul beyond disguise.\nFor beast or man, for foe or friend,\nYour compassion has no end.\n\nYou showed us how to live so plain,\nWith little need, no selfish gain.\nWith barefoot grace and monk�s attire,\nYou teach renunciation�s fire.\n\nWith folded palms, this prayer we raise,\nTo glorify your wondrous ways.\nPlease let us serve with heart and soul,\nAnd walk behind you, toward the goal.\n==================================================\n\nThis year, we reflected many times on your strong sdhan, your inconceivable humility, and the way you love each living being without discrimination. Just hearing about your attachment to the Brajvss, and your love for Vndvana, awakens something dormant in our hearts.\n\nPersonally, Guru Mahrja, this year you carried me through a difficult time in my professional life. You guided me from within, even though I didn�t know what to do. Because of your teachings and example, I chose what I now clearly see was the right path � the Krishna conscious path, not the selfish one. Without your mercy, I would have acted unwisely and suffered much more.\n\nOn the devotional front, you gave us a gift beyond anything we could imagine. The humble space where we�ve been doing outreach � singing krtana, discussing Bhagavad-gt, building bridges with curious souls � became blessed by your divine presence. You came personally, led us in a most powerful krtan, and even gave second initiations there. Guru Mahrja, this was your love manifest � completely causeless � and we pray to never forget it.\n\nWith folded palms, we beg your blessings to continue this service. Please allow us to expand this American-born outreach, to carry rla Prabhupda's message to every corner, heart to heart, soul to soul.\n\nWe don�t know how long we will live, or how many chances we will get. But we pray that for at least one full decade, if not more, we may continue this seva under your guidance � not for name, not for numbers, but as an offering of love to your lotus feet.\n\nWe place our lives at your lotus feet, praying only that we may always remember your instructions, serve your mission faithfully, and remain your eternal servants � life after life, birth after birth.\n\nWith love and gratitude,\n\nyour servants,\nSundari Lila devi dasi and Sri Kumara dasa"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nLast October you accepted me as your servant in Srila Prabhupada�s mission, offering me the name Kalindi Gopi devi dasi.\nI would have liked to be your Hanuman, but I quickly realized that I�m not even a squirrel nor a spider� I�m just a speck of dust that some merciful devotees put in a place to serve in some tiny way.\nYour mercy is like an ocean without bottom and without shores, and in this aspect, you are so similar to your beloved guru maharaj and founder Acarya of Iskcon, His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada.\nYou received your first initiation via letter, and as far as I know, you didn�t have so much *vapu* association with him, but nevertheless, you served him with all your life and soul, and you are still serving him, inspiring other souls to follow his footsteps back to Godhead.\nYour disciple Anubhava mataji said that we are very fortunate because you are offering us the possibility to serve you in separation.\nInitially, after initiation, I was overwhelmed by sadness. Then, thanks to the mercy of my parents, Karuna Caitaya das and bhaktin Paola, and my *shiksa* guru Bhaktya Labhya prabhu, I started to perceive your presence in my daily life. I never felt so much love, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this opportunity.\nYou are such an extraordinary example and a reservoir of all good qualities that being connected with you gives your disciples the possibility to tune into your love and devotion. You are so present through your *vani* form and also through the sweet memories of all your reciprocations that you kindly offer. And you are reciprocating also now, that you are thousands of kilometers away from me, teaching me that spiritual love can transcend every oceanic distance that reduces itself to the water contained in the hoofprint of a calf.\nSrila Prabhupada, during one of his last days on this planet Earth, said to his disciples: �It is my duty to increase your love for me.� You are also doing this with all of us disciples. But not to keep this love for you. No, you are nourishing and increasing our love for you only to offer it to Srila Prabhupada and to the Lord.\nSo you are a transparent medium, and loving you, we can learn how to love Krishna. What an extraordinary service, Maharaj, you are offering to the Lord. I have no words to thank you; I just want to offer my life to your lotus feet. You are healing me from envy during your every *kirtan*; you gave me two best friends and a lot of extraordinary devotees to learn from and to serve; you definitely saved my life.\nPlease, continue to accept the grape and the pear with ghee that I offered you after the initiation *yajna*: it was so insignificant as a gift, but you, in order to encourage me, accepted it as something very precious.\nYou preach with every gesture you do. Your *Krishna-katha* are appreciated by thousands of devotees, and yet you are so humble as to wash the dishes of the devotees. You are giving me the strength to continue my service here in Torino, allowing me to gradually add Krishna in my life.\nI hope to make you happy, Maharaj.\nMy life is yours; please make me dance.\nI also pray that Sri Sri Radha Gopinath will always protect you physically, mentally, and spiritually.\nYour insignificant and grateful servant,\nKalindi Gopi Devi Dasi"

I don�t know how I became so fortunate to have you as my spiritual master; it is definitely not due to my qualification, but purely your compassion and mercy.\nI still remember seeing you for the first time at Sadhu Sanga 2024. Your glance was like beaming moonlight falling upon fallen souls like us, soothing and uplifting them. It was a magical moment for me. Getting your association in the presence of Kalachandji was another divine experience of my life, and ever since then, I had accepted you as my spiritual master.\nYour sensitivity towards devotees truly touches me�the way you reciprocate with each and every soul, irrespective of their background, is amazing. This reminds me of another event at Sadhu Sanga 2025, where you were so humble, sitting on the ground with your godbrother, while devotees were hovering around you, eager to have your daran. I happened to come and offer my obeisances, and as soon as we rose, you were directly glancing at us�showering your blessings through your sparkling eyes and compassionate smile. That moment showed how personally you reciprocate with everyone.\nYour mercy has also always been seen through your disciples. Somehow or other, they have consistently helped me move forward with proper guidance, reminding me to stay focused on what is truly important�the essence of everything: to please Krishna.\nI am eternally indebted to you, Guru Mahrja, and to our whole Gauya parampar for giving me this gift of Krishna consciousness and a family in which I can practice it. May your lectures and instructions always guide and nourish me on this journey. And may I always act in a way that pleases the devotees, you, rla Prabhupda, and r Krishna.\n\nWishing you a very happy and blissful 75th Vysa-pj, Guru Mahrja.\n\nYour servant,\nPreetiGopik Dev ds"

    "Your Offering": "75th VYASA PUJA OF GURU-MAHARAJ - HH RADHANATH SWAMI\n\nDear Guru Maharaj,\nKindly accept my humble, prostrated obeisances unto the dust of your lotus feet. All glories to your divine personality. All glories to Sri Guru & Gauranga. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa-Puja ceremony, I wish to write a few words of glorification of your exalted personality and also to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude for your mercy and compassion on this fallen, conditioned soul.\n\nDear Guru-Maharaj, your life is a life of sacrifice and austerity. As we read in your book, �The Journey Home,� the incidents and the near-death experiences that you endured to find your true calling are really mind-boggling. Once you found your path, your inner journey on the path of Bhakti began. We hear from you and also from the devotees how you practiced Bhakti in New Vrindavan in utmost austere conditions. Your complete surrender to Srila Prabhupada was exhibited by your full submission to the authority, without any complaints or fault-finding. You truly followed the mood of being a servant of the servant. Krishna extracted the price from you, and you humbly and successfully paid the price. You won the heart of Srila Prabhupada, the Guru Parampara, and ultimately Krishna, who all rewarded you with great preaching success in America and then in Mumbai, where you developed a great devotee congregation centered around Radha Gopinath temple. Many with high degrees like medicine, IIT grads, and big businessmen, etc., surrendered their lives to your mission in pleasing Srila Prabhupada. Another landmark success was achieved under your leadership by the development of Govardhan Eco Village (GEV) � a beautiful farm on the outskirts of Mumbai. This was created to attract foreign tourists who can experience spirituality in the lush, serene atmosphere and also be inspired to live a Vedic lifestyle of simple living and high thinking. Your book �Journey Home� was a great success, and then your second book, �Journey Within,� became a New York Times Best Seller through the efforts of all disciples and well-wishers. Needless to mention your wonderful and joyful yearly Yatras to holy places, which we all eagerly look forward to participating in every year. This year, about 12,000 devotees attended, and I was completely astonished by how smoothly it was conducted and also by your inspiration, how so many devotees served in various services, especially the kitchen. Your Yatras bring out within our hearts the feelings of humility and gratitude for what we are receiving, and by seeing the devotees' tireless service attitude, our hearts melt.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, you are the personification of Vaishnava seva, Nama ruchi, and Jiva doya, which you live by every moment. The most important aspect of Bhakti is Hearing, and your wonderful classes are full of your deep, profound realizations, hearing which my desert-like heart is nourished and becomes joyful. Hearing your classes keep me focused towards the goal amidst so many distractions.\n\nThank you so much, GuruMaharaj, for all the wonderful gifts you have given, and I pray that I always remain in the association of your sincere disciples and be inspired to follow your instructions and live up to your standards and expectations that you have set for all of us.\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your 75th birthday, we all pray to Krishna for your good health and long life and great success in your mission to please Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour insignificant servants of the servants of your glorious servants,\n\nGovinda Sundara das\nPrema Vinodini Devi dasi\nLalitha Sakhi"

This is the ultimate goal of our existence, and to achieve it, we seek your blessings, Gurudev.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to you, Gurudev, for allowing us to receive your association and instructions through your lectures and activities. Though we have not personally seen Srila Prabhupada, we see how enthusiastically you follow the instructions of your spiritual master. We feel truly fortunate to witness our own spiritual master following his Guru with such love, sincerity, and integrity. This inspires us to follow you with the same devotion and spirit.\n\nEvery day we are realizing the goal of our lives more deeply, and through this realization, our spiritual happiness increases with each passing day.\n\nGurudev, you have made us truly rich, for Srila Prabhupada says that real wealth is not material but spiritual. You have enriched us immeasurably in spiritual life.\n\nWhen we look at people in society suffering under the three modes of material nature, we realize how merciful Srila Prabhupada and you have been in placing us on the higher platform of *bhakti-yoga*. We are profoundly grateful for this gift. We remain committed to serving you and Srila Prabhupada until the last breath of our lives, in the humble mood of the servants of the servants. Please bless us, Guru Maharaj. \n\nIn 2017, while on duty, I lost vision in my left eye. My mother, Amal Bhakti Devi, who is now 94 years old, has been bedridden since then. Because of her condition and my partial loss of vision, it became challenging to go out regularly for *seva* and spiritual programs. I could not neglect her care, which created a dilemma for me. So, at times, I stayed home to care for her while Swarup Shakti Devi Dasi attended temple programs, and other times, we switched roles. I began searching for a place near our temple, where I could take care of my mother and also engage in temple *seva*, serve the Vaishnavas, and attend programs to stay in the association of devotees. By the mercy of Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Behari ji and Madan Mohan ji, your project \"Govardhan Kunj\" was announced, and by great fortune, I received an allotment there. This has provided us a wonderful opportunity to care for my mother at home while also engaging in *seva*, attending temple programs, and having the company of devotees.\n\nAt the time of the project�s inauguration, that is *Vastu Puja*, you addressed us with just two words � \"Welcome home!\" At that very moment, we felt sheltered and realized that this truly is our spiritual home.\n\nThank you for everything, Guru Maharaj. Please bless us, Gurudev, so that we can serve our mother and all devotees with proper consciousness, in the mood of humble servants of the servants.\n\nYour humble servants,\nSanatan Pran Das and Swarup Shakti Devi Dasi"

My life has become transformed by coming in contact with you. You are distributing love of God far and wide, giving people the actual happiness they are looking for. You are a living Bhagawat. Your lectures touch the heart and answer all questions. You give wonderful insights on deep spiritual matters with your great realizations. I want to be the servant of your servants eternally. You teach this principle in your lectures, very mercifully. You extend yourself so much, in spite of health problems, just to distribute Krishna consciousness, out of love and compassion. Your heart is filled with bhakti. Krishna says, \"Bhaktya Mam abhijanati.\" You practice and teach this, how we should engage in loving devotional service with great determination and sincerity.\n\nYou kindly teach the principle of\nTrnad api sunichena\nTaror api sahisnuna\nAmanina manadena\nKirtaniya sada Harih\n\nYou always focus on chanting Hare Krishna Mahamantra very sincerely, from our hearts, serving Vaishnavas, and making the order of Guru as life and soul.\n\nI am a fallen fool Guru Maharaja. The dust of your lotus feet is the only hope.\n\nYou are inspiring people all over the world to chant and sing Hare Krishna. In America, so many clubs and societies are chanting Hare Krishna. They come to India also for visits. You have inspired so many of your disciples and other devotees to wonderfully spread Krishna consciousness all over the world.\n\nBy so many examples, you showed the power of unity, love, and cooperation, with Krishna in the center, with Prabhupada and Guru's service in the center.\n- By your inspiration, Chowpatty devotees unitedly distributed maximum books in the December Marathon.\n- Kartik Yatras. They are historic; such yatras are never seen before, as far as I can see. Over 12,000 devotees, many hundreds from foreign countries, Russia, USA, Africa, etc. First-class feast prasadam cooked for everyone for around 8 days. Over 150 buses for visiting holy places. Excellent management. All devotees chanting, dancing, and many crying out of ecstasy. They pay attention to so many details, due to their bhakti, to make devotees comfortable. You show how we should serve Vaishnavas. You are very dear to Lord Krishna and Prabhupada.\n- Govardhan Eco Village. You showed how a Krishna conscious community should be: simple living, high thinking. Millions of devotees visit there and find peace of mind and connect with Krishna.\n- Devotees from Chowpatty are very big donors for TOVP and Prabhupada's places in Kolkata.\n- Your disciples are humbly leading so many projects all over the world.\n\nChowpatty is a small temple with a big number of devotees with very big, compassionate hearts.\n\nYou kindly teach that a devotee should not hear criticism of another devotee or Lord, and should never engage in politicking. These destroy the devotee community and the faith of devotees.\n\nAnd you teach that we should serve under the ISKCON Authorities; that's how we please Guru and Srila Prabhupada.\n\nPlease bless that I can become your loyal servant of servant.\n\nYour servant\nAkash Khandelia\nISKCON Ujjain"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nThis year I have had the fortune to read both The Journey Home and The Journey Within. Devotees generally read this in the very beginning of their Bhakti. Some even before that. But it took me well over 3 years, and reading Bhagavad Gita and many Prabhupada books, to be able to read it. And as I read them, I could understand and unravel what HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj is all about:\n1.\tBhakti: Having travelled to so many countries and tested so many religions/paths for self-realization, and choosing Bhakti as the highest path is a testimony for everyone that we need not go and explore what is there in the other paths, just follow the highest path of devotional service as given by the Acharyas. The Hare Krishna Maha Mantra was revealed to you by Mother Ganga, is another example of how God revealed the correct path for you.\n2.\tVrindavan: I had the fortune of visiting your eternal home, Sri Vrindavan Dham, this year for the first time on your Annual Kartik Yatra. I could realize that you are the real Vrajavasi who made Vrindavan your home, carried it in your heart, and spread it to the world. I could realize that you remember the exact details of each and every place in Vrindavan, and by your deep meditation, you have replicated this very Vrindavan in GEV. I�ve been 3-4 times to GEV, but now I can truly appreciate what GEV is and what it means for you. By your mercy only, people who don�t know about Vrindavan, or are not interested in it, get the opportunity to visit Vrindavan at GEV and get a very good spiritual experience. I now understand why the board at the start of the Vrindavan forest says that it is meant to �remember Vrindavan in separation�. Your stay in Vrindavan was the turning point in your life, and this became the turning point in the lives of all those whom you came in contact with.\n3.\tHumility and Service: Your mood of �td api su-ncena taror iva sahiun amnin mna-dena krtanya sad hari� is the highest mood which a person can have. Just like all the Vrajavasis, the Gopis, Srimati Radharani, the cowherd boys, Govardhan, all just aspire to serve Krsna in the mood of servant of servant, you too have the simple desire to serve all devotees in that mood. Despite ill health, you have been travelling far and wide, just so that you can serve the fallen conditioned souls and bring them closer to Krsna.\nI pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, Sri Sri Gaur Nitai, and Srila Prabhupada for your good health. Although I am unqualified, I beg your mercy to help assist in whatever small way I can to serve you and further the mission of Srila Prabhupada, to serve in the mood of the servant of the servant of the servant of the devotees. Even if I am not like the service and the circumstances I am in, please provide me the strength to endure everything and use me as an instrument in your service.\nYour aspiring servant,\nVarun Padav"

May I always remember your instructions, remain grateful for your mercy, and strive to become a worthy instrument in your hands.\n\nMay Guru Maharaj, Radhanath Swami, always be blessed with perfect health, boundless joy, and endless inspiration.\n\nHare Krishna\n\nAt your lotus feet,\nYour insignificant servant,\nAnuradha Priti Devi Dasi\nDublin, Ireland"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nOn this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, I am humbly attempting to offer a few words in your divine honor.\nThank you, Gurudev, for descending into this material world to deliver fallen souls like me, lost in the darkness of ignorance and illusion. Your compassion and mercy are beyond the capacity of my words to describe.\nFor a long time, I thought that you began taking care of me only from the day I formally took shelter of you. But now I realize how mistaken I was. You have been guiding my path, watching over me, and preparing my heart for your shelter long before I even knew of your divine presence.\nHow truly fortunate I am to have come under your merciful guidance. May I always remain your humble servant, sincerely striving to follow your instructions with faith, sincerity, and devotion.\nThrough the medium of your devotees, you have always guided and molded my spiritual journey with great care and love.\nYour journey as a nineteen-year-old youth�risking everything, even your life, to find your beloved spiritual master and your Lordships Sri Sri Radha-Krishna�is a glorious example and a life lesson for me.\nTrnd api suncena taror api sahiun Amanin mnadena krtanyah sad harih\nGuru Maharaj, you are the living embodiment of this third verse of the ikakam. You constantly remind us, through your words and actions, to remain humble in every situation of life, in every seva, and in all dealings with devotees. You have always taught us to keep Krishna in the center of everything we do.\nYour profound lectures on the r Caitanya-caritmta are my lifeline. You narrate each pastime with such depth, detail, and devotion that it reflects your deep love for Mahaprabhu. Even with my limited understanding, I have noticed that you always connect every Hari-katha�even Krishna-lila�to the teachings and mood of Lord Chaitanya.\nOn this sacred day of your divine appearance, I sincerely beg for shelter at your lotus feet. I know I am still far from becoming your worthy disciple. I need to strengthen my sadhana and strive to imbibe genuine Vaishnava qualities within my heart. At present, my heart feels hard like a rock�lacking compassion and filled with selfish desires. Without your causeless mercy, I have no hope of transformation.\nTherefore, Gurudev, I beg you to kindly continue to shower your mercy upon me, as you have always done, so that I may gradually purify myself and one day become a true servant of your mission.\n\nYour aspiring servant of the servant of the servant of the servant,\nMounika Seeram"

It was a very amazing experience again this year during Kartik Yatra. Last year I couldn�t come, so it was almost like attending Yatra after two years. I was so touched again by your mesmerizing classes.\nI would like to highlight some important qualities which touched my heart from your Krishna katha, expressed through the \"GURU VANI\":\n\nG � Genuine Enthusiasm and Ever-Fresh Krishna-katha\n\tYou always narrate classes with a lot of enthusiasm.\n\tYou have been narrating these pastimes for many years, yet every story and pastime feels new and fresh each time for you and you narrate it as if you are narrating it for the first time. This shows how pure Krishna-katha is always ever-fresh and never boring, unlike mundane material topics which fade with time.\n\t\nU � Unalloyed Pure Devotional Focus\n\tYour classes are truly based on pure devotional principles, with no tinge of any mixture, as rmad Bhgavatam says �dharma projjhita-kaitavo �tra.�\n\tFocusing again, again on trinad api sunichena - humility, dasanudas - becoming servant, na dhanam na janam na sundarim - aspiring for pure devotion.\n\t\nR � Respectful\n\tYou are always very respectful to all your godbrothers and godsisters, although you are speaking to many thousands of devotees.\n\t\nR � Rigorous and Long-Lasting Nectar\n\tYour classes are long and detailed, as rmad Bhgavatam says �drgha-satrena.�\n\tThey act as the real medicine for the dirty hearts of Kali-yuga souls like me.\n\tYou sit straight and speak for many hours with complete absorption and focus.\n\tOn the contrary, I keep looking at the clock, which reveals my lack of taste. \n\t\nU � Unparalleled Sweetness of Words\n\tThe words you use are divine and sweet; anyone who hears them falls in love with Krishna. Once HG Caitanya Charan Prabhu was appreciating your Journey Home book and said you never wrote it in an instructive way but as the journey of a person, gradually guiding people on the right path.\n\tThis madhura-vaca is another feature of a pure devotee, whose words touch hearts and transform lives.\n\t\nV - Vibrant Devotion\n\tYou are not just instructing us to develop taste for chanting and hearing Krishna-katha but you are a living example of it, you practically demonstrate it through your own example. You practically demonstrate the genuine taste for Krishna-katha. It is not artificial at all.\n\tEvery class you give is filled with energy, emotion, and deep devotion. You show us that hearing and chanting about Krishna is the real happiness of life.\n\t\nA � Absorbed and Analytical Depth\n\tWhile narrating pastimes, you lose track of time � a sign of your deep absorption in Krishna-katha. You never try to cut short pastimes; you go deep into them and fully immerse in Krishna-katha.\n\nN � Nourishing\n\tml hay kare sei bja ropaa\n\travaa-krtana-jale karaye secana\n\t\t�When a person receives the seed of devotional service, he should take care of it by becoming a gardener and sowing the seed in his heart. If he waters the seed gradually by the process of ravaa and krtana [hearing and chanting], the seed will begin to sprout.\" \n\tYou are not only giving us the seed of bhakti but nourishing it through right hearing and kirtanam.\n\nI � Illuminating Guidance and Instruction\n\tYour classes are both sweet and nectarean, yet at the same time they act as medicine through many instructions and shake us and awaken us. You so compassionately expose our anarthas, helping us see and overcome them.\n\nMaharaj, I seek your blessings and prayers that I may make your instructions the main guiding light for my practice (�guru-mukha-padma-vkya cittete koriy aikya�) and practically live by your teachings, always remembering your divine example in relishing Krishna-katha.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nTamal Govind Das"

    "Your Offering": "My Most Beloved Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my prostrated obeisances at your lotus feet.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada, Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga.\n\nIn the month of January this year, my mother was facing some health challenges and was hospitalized. During those days, I found myself constantly brooding over our situation, lamenting that I did not have the means to help her as I wished. In that state of helplessness, I began praying intensely � even yearning to become wealthy � forgetting what my real aspiration in life should truly be. Honestly speaking, Guru Maharaj, I confess that I do have the habit of praying like this at times.\n\nOne day, while I was in the hospital, in one of your lectures which I was hearing you narrated a pastime that touched and instructed my heart deeply. It was exactly what I needed to hear at that time, and I had never heard that pastime before. You spoke about a poor South Indian Dravidian brahmana who was living in such abject poverty that his relatives and society had abandoned him. He was extremely thin and sickly due to starvation, unable to obtain even his daily food. Overcome by hunger and despair, he went to Jagannatha Puri and stood before Lord Jagannatha, praying that if the Lord did not make him wealthy, he would end his life. The next day, he came again before the Lord and vowed that if Lord Jagannatha did not make him wealthy within seven days, he would end his life.\n\nThree days passed, yet nothing changed. Again, he approached the Lord and repeated his threat, giving Him four more days. But even after that, his condition remained the same. Finally, in utter hopelessness, the brahmana went to the ocean, resolved to end his life by drowning.\n\nAs he was about to enter the water, he suddenly beheld a majestic personality emerging from the sea � so vast and resplendent that the sight left him speechless. As this divine figure approached the shore, His form gradually became smaller, apt for this age. Filled with awe and curiosity, the brahmana approached him and tried to speak, though initially, the personality gave only brief and distant replies. Eventually, as the brahmana poured out his heart about his misery and intention to end his life, the personality became compassionate and told him that the only solution for his suffering was to see the smiling face of the Lord.\n\nThe divine personality then revealed himself � He was Vibhisana. He said, \"I am going to take darshan of the Lord. You can come along.\" And they walked towards Totagopinath temple where Lord Caitanya was with His associates. The brahmana was astonished and said that Lord Jagannatha, the Lord of the Universe, resided in the temple, but where were they going. Upon seeing Vibhisana, Lord Caitanya became filled with joy and affectionately called Him near, seemingly ignoring the poor brahmana. The two conversed lovingly, and during their exchange, Lord Caitanya told Vibhishan that this other brahmana who was sitting a little distance away and he spoke loud enough so that that brahmana could hear him. 'He's starving. He's suffering from terrible poverty and he's been rejected by everyone. Why It is due to his past sins. Whatever comes upon us is due to our own karma. And this fool, he is blaming God for his miseries. That is the condition of people in this world today,' Lord Caitanya said, 'They want to blame God for what they have brought upon themselves. And whatever good they get, whatever successes, they want to take the credit and forget Krsna altogether. Is this not the situation of people in this world Whatever goes wrong, why is God doing this to me And whatever goes right, see what I have done. But the pleasures and the pains, the happiness and distress that comes upon us in this world, it is all the reactions of our past karma. We are responsible. But this miserable soul is simply blaming the Lord. Not only blaming the Lord, but he has come to Jagannath Puri to harass Lord Jagannath. To make ultimatums to Lord Jagannath. But I tell you, Vibhishan, you should save him. And you should give him immense glory.'\n\n'As you say, my Lord,' said Vibhishan. Lord Caitanya said, 'Bring him back to South India and give him great wealth, real wealth.' Vibhishan offered his obeisances and they walked out. And the brahmana walked out with him.\n\nThat brahmana, he asked Vibhishan, 'Who was that Who is that sannyasi giving you orders, calling you Vibhishan And that order he gave you, very nice, but who was he giving you that order' And Vibhishan said, 'You are such a fool. That was Lord Jagannath.'\n\nThe brahmana said, 'You told me you were going to bring me to Jagannath and you just brought me to the sannyasi's house and you didn't even go to Jagannath's temple at all.' He said, 'You're a fool. That is Lord Jagannath. He has assumed the beautiful golden form of Sri Gauranga Mahaprabhu to give what no other incarnation has given, pure love of God, the greatest wealth.'\n\nSo the brahmana, he said, 'That's Lord Jagannath, so humble, so kind, so merciful. Please bring me to him. Bring me to him.' So Vibhishan came back. And Lord Caitanya asked, 'Why have you returned' And he said that this brahmana wants to say something to you.\n\nAnd the brahmana with tears in his eyes fell at the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya and surrendered and said, 'I am such a selfish person. I am such a fool. I'm diseased and I was asking you for a diet of food that was only going to increase the miseries of my disease. And I was not willing to ask you for the proper medicine. You are the supreme physician. I am an ignorant soul. But now I have come to take shelter of your lotus feet and accept the real medicine that you have given.'\n\nSri Caitanya Mahaprabhu told him, 'Whatever your karma may be, don't mind the happiness and distress because even if you have wealth that does not in any way guarantee that you will not suffer as much as a poor man, and even if you're poor, that does not mean you will not enjoy as much as a rich man. That is the way this world is. So tolerate both happiness and distress, which will come by their own arrangement. And fix your mind on the Lord and take the medicine of the chanting of the Holy Name. And you follow in the footsteps of Vibhishan and he will give you the greatest wealth, the wealth that your heart is longing for, and what is that wealth The purushartha siromani, the greatest of all treasures, the treasure of love of God, Krsna-Prema.'\n\nWhen I heard this pastime from your lotus lips, Guru Maharaj, it shook me deeply. I was amazed and humbled by its perfect timing. Through your vani, you rescued me from my self-centered desires and reminded me of the true purpose of life � to serve, to surrender, and to depend upon the mercy of the Lord. You gave me solace when I needed it.\n\nSince that day, this pastime has remained engraved in my heart. It continues to inspire and guide me whenever worldly anxieties arise, especially concerning money. I am endlessly grateful to you, Guru Maharaj, for giving me shelter through your divine vani.\n\nI pray that I may continue to hear your instructions attentively, purify my heart, and in some small and insignificant way, be of service to my Godbrothers and Godsisters who are sincerely assisting you in fulfilling the mission of Srila Prabhupada. Just as the brahmana received the mercy of the Lord through the association of Vibhisana, I too pray that I may always remain in the association of sincere Godbrothers and Godsisters � which is, in truth, your mercy. In their association, may I transform my heart for good and learn to serve with genuine humility.\n\nAt your lotus feet,\nYour insignificant son,\nCaitanya Purushottam das"

I came across your small talk... so ideally, you were the first face of ISKCON for me. I really liked your humility, Maharaj. I didn't know your name at that time.\n\nI later joined the Gurgaon ISKCON center and temples. After some time, COVID started, and centers and temples were shut down. At that time, through the Hare Krishna channel, I got connected to one Prabhu from GEV who was giving online classes. He was your disciple. Until then, I had heard many lectures in ISKCON, but when that Prabhu used to give lectures, it was really very heart-touching. I appreciated him once, and he said that it's my Guru's words which I am repeating.\n\nI inquired about his Guru, then for the first time, I got to know your name. When I checked the photograph... it was you... the same person. Maharaj, in a nutshell, I am completely sure if an egoistic soul like me can be surrendered to anyone, it is only you. You are the only one in whom I can never find any fault. Your actions speak more than your lectures... in any tough situation, I contemplate how you would react and then I react in a similar way.\nMaharaj, I am humbly waiting for the day when I can receive initiation from you. My name is already on the list, and I pray for your mercy that you kindly accept me whenever you feel it is right.\n\nMaharaj, I have sincerely examined my heart, and I feel a deep natural surrender and connection only with you. I do not feel this way with anyone else. Therefore, I am simply waiting with faith and patience for your guidance.\n\nMaharaj, I love and revere Srila Prabhupada deeply, and it is my heartfelt desire to remain within ISKCON under his shelter. At the same time, I do not want to take initiation from someone toward whom I cannot offer complete surrender. This is why I am placing my hope at your lotus feet.\n\nWhenever you decide is best, I am ready to follow your instructions. Kindly shower your mercy upon me.\n\nI have revealed my honest heart to you. I know I am way below your expectations, but you are like Krishna to me, so I wanted to say only the truth without any filter. Kindly save me.\n\nAlso, I have a deep desire to serve you. Kindly engage me in your service.\n\nYours sincerely,\nRomil Mehla"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nSrila Krishna Das Kaviraj Goswami mentions in Sri Caitanya Caritamrita quoting the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya (13.2):\n\nako phala tvda-darana hi\n tano phala tvda-gtra-saga\njihv-phala tvda-krtana hi\n su-durlabh bhgavat hi loke\n\n��My dear Vaiava, seeing a person like you is the perfection of one�s eyesight, touching your lotus feet is the perfection of the sense of touch, and glorifying your good qualities is the tongue�s real activity, for in the material world it is very difficult to find a pure devotee of the Lord.��\n\nOn this very auspicious occasion of your 75th vyasa puja, it is my great fortune to have the opportunity to express my gratitude for your unlimited kindness and grace upon me.\n\nAt each moment, you only desire to please Srila Prabhupada by making arrangements for all devotees to taste the nectar of chanting the Holy name and hearing the Holy fame of the Lord, to develop loving relationships with other devotees and to be eager to share their good fortune with all others. All the projects, processes, and initiatives are aimed at fulfilling this purpose alone. I remember that once when someone asked about \"what is important projects or people\", you very kindly replied, \"People are important, but what will they do without the projects\" In essence, you have always established the projects in a 'devotee nourishment-centered' way, and thus the projects have become a source of benediction for millions of devotees to offer their loving services to Sri Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas.\n\nOne such miracle which I recently witnessed is the Kartik Yatra at Sri Govardhan. Although I have been a part of yatra participants or even the management team to some degree for the last several years, it is only this year that I was wonderstruck at your extraordinary genius in making this a LIVE experience of the spiritual world for all of us.\n\nI am amazed at how the senior-most members of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath temple and GEV are actively involved in organizing the Kartik yatra to ensure that your vision and legacy is transmitted without any loss. HG Shyamanand pr, HG Sanat Kumar pr, HG Gauranga pr, HG Baldev pr, HG Vasudev pr, HG Hare Krishna pr, HG Nand Dulal pr, HG Sundarvar pr, and several other senior brahmacaris are totally absorbed in taking care of minute details to make it a memorable experience for all members. Although they have enormous responsibilities and other services, they still keep yatra services at the topmost priority for your pleasure.\n\nI am not able to get into micro details of each department which functions during the yatra, but I wish to express my gratitude to you for creating the extremely rich culture and mood of Vaishnava seva at all levels. Not even once did I find any kind of breach of etiquette or raising of voice, or criticism, or fault-finding, or even disagreement in the entire process of organizing and managing the yatra. Differences of opinion have been dealt with in a very cordial way without any kind of offensive speech or action. I also saw the same quality of absorption, appreciation, and meditation on pleasing the Vaishnavas being passed down to the incharges of different services and departments. Each incharge has been meditating throughout the year to improve the quality of their offering to the Vaishnava community, and this is the very essence of spiritual dealings in the spiritual world. Be it Kitchen, Senior Vaishnavas� prasadam serving, Pandal maintenance, Bus arrangement, Plate washing, Prasadam transferring and serving, Cooking, Chapati Making, Festival cooking, deity worship, Dham visit, Kids Zone, Accommodation arrangement, guests care, drinking water arrangement, registration, health care, stalls, sound system, waste management, or any other seva, every involved devotee had absolutely great absorption in executing it for the exclusive purpose of pleasing yourself and all the participating members. Thus, even an average devotee could get an experience of what the spiritual world would feel like. By your very thoughtful arrangement of cooking bhoga on firewood stoves by hundreds of devotees, everyone cried with real tears in their eyes in the Holy Dham in the most auspicious month of Kartik.\n\nOn my own accord, I do not have any capacity to practice the process of Krishna Consciousness properly or to serve the devotees in the right consciousness. However, by your own causeless mercy, you have appointed HG Radheshyam prabhuji as my caretaker, mentor, and master, and by his kind mercy and empowerment, I am engaged in some services for your pleasure. On this very auspicious day, I pray for your good health and well-being and humbly beg for a drop of mercy to live by the principles of humility, tolerance, and respecting all without expecting any respect. This is the only foundation based on which anything else I do can please your heart.\n\nThank you very much for revealing the spiritual world through GEV, Kartik Yatras, your absorbing lectures, your vibrant kirtans, your loving dealings with your god brothers and god sisters, and your very dedicated and devoted disciples.\nYour humble servant,\nRevatipati Das"

The sight struck me profoundly.\n\nThat moment revealed your heart � your total absorption in service to your Guru and the Lord. It showed how your every breath, every thought, and every moment is centered on glorifying the Lord and nourishing your disciples. That single vision became a lifetime lesson for me on what true dedication, focus, and humility mean in bhakti.\n> yasya prasdd bhagavat-prasdo\nyasyprasdn na gati kuto 'pi\n\n�By the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the mercy of Krishna;\nwithout his grace, there is no means of advancement.�\n\nGurudev, your mercy is my only hope. Your presence brings shelter in chaos and clarity in confusion. Your words awaken faith and your example teaches what no book can convey � the essence of love in service.\n\nOn this auspicious celebration of your 75th Vysa-pj � a diamond jubilee of divine compassion � I pray to remain ever under your shelter.\nMay I carry your instructions in my heart and manifest them through my life.\nMay I serve your mission, however small my capacity, with sincerity and devotion.\nAnd may I never forget that every drop of spiritual fortune in my life flows from your lotus feet.\n\nThank you, Gurudev, for showing the world that real greatness lies in humility, and that the highest knowledge is love.\n\nYour eternal servant,\nKrishnaprakash Das"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept our humble obeisances! All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\nWishing you a very happy and blessed Vyas Puja & Appearance Day! We are fortunate that we are witnessing this celebrated day in our life with you.\nI do not have the right words and may not have the right disposition to express my gratitude towards you; nonetheless, I am very happy to speak, even though through broken words, in your glorification and for my own purification.\nI had heard in one of your classes, where you said that we all should know how fortunate we are! You further mentioned that we should know that we are not fortunate for what we are, but we are fortunate for what we have been given, and that makes our good fortune. I was highly taken aback with such profound understanding and wisdom!\nSo, yes, we are indeed very fortunate and our good fortune is due to what we have been given by Krishna, i.e. your association (having you in our life) or more benevolently by your acceptance of us under your merciful shelter.\nbrahma bhramite kona bhgyavn jva, guru-Krishna-prasde pya bhakti-lat-bja\nAll living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe, and one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Krishna, and by the mercy of both Krishna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.\nLike Srimati Radharani accepted that small jackal who was crying, burning due to the fire, you accepted us who were burning in the fire of the material world, with your care, compassion, and loving-kindness.\nI really cannot fathom my good fortune of having got an opportunity to come in contact with a pure devotee of the Lord like you. Now when I look back, it only amazes me. I did not even know proper English, so I could not fully understand the first lecture I heard from your lotus mouth, and since I was afraid of speaking in English, I would not come near you physically, but my sustenance and nourishment have only been through your lectures, classes, kirtans, and your divine vani. Somehow, forcibly, I got hooked to your lectures/classes when I used to extract few droplets/lines out of them to share with others (as daily morning Nectarean Mellows e-mails), and as I used to hear/record your classes for iskcondesiretree uploads, it nourished me more and more, and I started understanding and relishing the classes and instructions as well as the profound wisdom contained in them.\nIt has been a long journey and at the same time, maya is very strong, so I still need your mercy to get purified in order to come to the platform of true humility, tolerance, and cooperation, the principles you enumerate in your classes.\nWe seek your blessings and mercy that one day we can truly imbibe the teachings of Lord Chaitanya and Srila Prabhupada to perfect our existence in a way that may please you, Srila Prabhupada, and our exalted Guru Parampara.\nThank you for accepting us, and we endeavor to remain as servants of your servants.\nRasamrita Das & family (Naambhaav Mataji, Madhuri Sakhipriya Devi Dasi, Kishori & Gauranga), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nOver the last couple of years, I have been listening to your lectures with more regularity and more eagerness than ever before. As part of my service to Sri Sri Radha-Kalachandji, I am now regularly scheduled to give Srimad-Bhagavatam class, and I feel deeply grateful to be able to repeat even a drop of what I have heard from you.\n\nSome of the teachings that have settled deepest in my mind and heart this year include:\n\n� Why Lord Chaitanya chose Ishvara Puri as His guru�because of Ishvara Puri�s unparalleled humility and his willingness to perform the most menial personal service for his own spiritual master. This teaches us that a spiritual master�s true qualification is not their learning or eloquence, but their loving service to their own guru. Your unwavering dedication to Srila Prabhupada�your life of service, sacrifice, and loyalty to his mission�constantly reminds me what real discipleship looks like.\n\n� Gratitude requires humility�that we are only grateful for things we feel we do not deserve.\n\n� Real advancement happens when we serve even when we don�t feel like it. When the mind wants to �do something else,� but we choose Krishna anyway, that is the moment we truly take a step forward on the bhakti path.\n\n� Remember every good anyone has done for you, and forget the rest.\n\n� If we want Krishna�s forgiveness, we must forgive others�be mindful of how many lifetimes of offenses we have committed before being given even the smallest spark of bhakti.\n\n� Grihastha life as a partnership�that Krishna conscious marriage should not be something we merely tolerate due to vows, but something dynamic, alive, and centered on service to Krishna. When husband and wife help each other advance, their home becomes an ashrama, a place of purification.\n\nOne teaching in particular touched me very deeply. In a 1990 Q&A session in Mumbai, you told the story of your days in New Vrindavan�when you were getting only a few hours of sleep, working constantly, and had almost no time for reading. You described how you would rush your prasadam, then force yourself to read while walking quickly and reading aloud just to stay awake. Because you approached the Bhagavatam with such eagerness and sacrifice�tapasya�you learned more during those difficult days than at any other time. You taught that Krishna reciprocates not with our intellect or memory, but with our sacrifice, our earnestness, and our hunger to understand even one line of His message. That one story changed the way I approach my reading, my hearing, and even my attempts to teach.\n\nThank you, Maharaj. Your words continue to guide me, challenge me, and steady me. I pray to develop a fraction of your hunger to serve Srila Prabhupada and the Vaishnavas in this lifetime. I know that I am a fool, an imposter, and have no qualification to speak on the scriptures, but whatever little I am able to share in classes is only because of what I have received from you. Please bless me to always listen with eagerness, to practice with sincerity, and to serve Sri Sri Radha-Kalachandji and the devotees in the spirit of the teachings you have given.\n\nYour servant,\nManjari Gopika"

One must give one�s life and soul to please the Lord, the spiritual master, and the Parampara.

This has left a deep impression on us.\n\nOn this landmark 75th Vyasa Puja, we know you have blessings for all your disciples and the entire world, yet we feel unable to fully reciprocate.

All glories to Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga.\n\nIn Srimad-Bhagavatam 5.14.38, it is described that this material world is full of misery. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada writes that the miseries of the conditioned soul are relieved by the association of pure devotees. That�s why devotees of ISKCON should become pure devotees so that they can give a chance to people to associate with pure devotees. This is topmost philosophical work.\n\nWe are also suffering in the material world, but fortunately, we got the association of HH Bhakti Rasamrita Swami, who brought me to your association. One thing I have observed in both of you is that both of you are pure devotees. Your association is my only asset in spiritual life.\n\nI pray today that I may remain in the association of pure devotees and become servant of servants.\n\nYours servant of servant,\nDinabandhu Das"

I have always longed to write something for you that truly satisfies my heart. I remember, in every class, you begin by describing the glories of Srila Prabhupada and end with the same. This simple yet profound practice inspires me deeply.\n\nYou are a role model for generations after generations. Each step you take, each caution you exercise, becomes an inspiration for millions. Your guidance is a great blessing on the path of bhakti. I am forever grateful and indebted to you for showering such grace. By your mercy, if I may not get the wonderful dearest guru maharaj in my life, I am not sure where I would be. I am so, so, very, very grateful and indebted to you that you showered so much grace. Only by your grace and, of course, my beloved Gauranga Prabhuji�s grace, and there are so many wonderful Vaishnavas, by your grace, I got so many devotees around me to inspire my bhakti life.\n\nYou once shared that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur Prabhupada told Srila Prabhupada in their first meeting: the world will change socially, politically, technologically, but the soul remains eternal. Srila Prabhupada taught that we are not these bodies, and our nature is to serve Krishna. You exemplify this by living bhakti sincerely, caring for every devotee as a parent.\n\nYour classes are a medicine for my consciousness, curing envy with love, hatred with care, chaos with calm. Like a jaundiced patient needing sugarcane juice, I am still trying to recover from my envious mentality by hearing your divine wisdom classes every day without failure. Your classes and your teachings are the ONLY way, dear guru maharaj, for me to develop attraction to your guru, sadhu, sastra, and the holy names of the Lord.\n\nThank you so much, dear Guru Maharaj, for being my role model, my life, my soul, my heart, and my everything. I love you <3\n\nI wrote one beautiful poem for you � a just small liner �\n\nHard to cross the endless ocean of the material world,\nWaves of greed, storms of desire surge around the inner world.\n\nBut when we take shelter of Your lotus feet,\nEven the deepest seas turn into shallow streams.\n\nWith Your grace, steers the chanting boat,\nEvery soul sails to Krishna�s coast.\n\nI pray to Radha Madanmohanji and Radha Vrindavan Behari and Sri Giriraj Govardhanji for your super good health and wellbeing.\n\nThank you very much, Maharaj, for accepting me as your servant of your servant of your servant.\n\nTrying to be your servant of your servant,\nShuddha Naam Das"

I will offer it to Their Lordships, praying that They accept this small offering made in your name and remembering your great love for sharing Krishna Prasadam with all.\nI have no qualification on my own, Guru Maharaj.

Whatever little fortune we possess in spiritual life is only because of your causeless mercy and the mercy of Srila Prabhupada, who sent you as his empowered servant to spread the message of Krishna consciousness with such love, humility, and compassion.\n\nWe are utterly unworthy, yet you have accepted us as your own, overlooking our countless shortcomings. Just as the sun never discriminates while shining upon all, your mercy too flows unrestricted � reaching even the most fallen. The more we try to understand your magnanimity, the more humbled we become, realizing how small, insignificant, and dependent we truly are before your divine heart.\n\nThis year�s Kartik Yatra at Govardhan was especially memorable and spiritually uplifting. It reminded us so much of the Pune Yatras, where for hours together you would lead soul-stirring kirtans and share nectarean Krishna-katha that melted our hearts. Your presence transformed the holy dham into a living embodiment of love for Krishna.\n\nWe were deeply moved on Srila Prabhupada�s Disappearance Day, when you sang those heartfelt bhajans with tears in your eyes. Every note carried the weight of your devotion and gratitude to Srila Prabhupada. Witnessing you offer your heart and soul to our Param Guru, we were inspired to pray � �When will we develop even a fraction of such deep love, surrender, and gratitude toward our spiritual master� Truly, Gurudev, you have shown us what it means to love in separation, to serve in gratitude, and to live in remembrance of one�s Guru and Krishna.\n\nDuring the Annakut celebration at Govardhan, our joy knew no bounds when we saw you personally appreciating every devotee and every dish lovingly prepared for Giriraj Govardhan Ji. Your affectionate glance uplifted everyone; your words of appreciation encouraged even the smallest efforts. We aspire, by your mercy, to one day develop that same genuine appreciation for devotees � seeing every devotee as a precious servant of Krishna, just as you always do.\n\nWe are also profoundly grateful to you, Gurudev, for gifting us the divine opportunity to serve in the Bhaktivedanta Hospital and to be part of such a wonderful congregation of devotees. You have shown us that true service is not merely a duty, but an offering of love to the Lord and His devotees. We pray for the strength, humility, and purity of heart to serve this mission with the same sincerity and dedication you embody.\n\nYou have also mercifully entrusted us with the responsibility of serving as counselors for the devotees of Mumbai and Konkan. This is indeed your special mercy upon us. Yet, we know that without imbibing the spirit of �dasa-dasanudas� � the servant of the servant of the servant � our service will remain incomplete. Therefore, we beg you, Gurudev, to bless us with the mood of genuine humility, to serve without pride, to guide without superiority, and to always remain your faithful instruments in spreading Srila Prabhupada�s mission.\n\nEach day, when we reflect upon our lives, we realize that every ounce of spiritual transformation, every spark of devotion, every moment of peace and purpose we experience � all originate from your mercy. You have not only shown us the path but also walked beside us, patiently guiding, correcting, and encouraging us at every step.\n\nGurudev, you are like a divine touchstone � whoever comes in contact with you becomes spiritually transformed. Your words illuminate the dark corners of our hearts; your example inspires us to strive for purity; your prayers shield us from maya�s allure. You are truly the compassionate heart of Srila Prabhupada�s mission � ever forgiving, ever inspiring, ever loving.\n\nWe offer our dandavat pranams again and again at your lotus feet, praying only for one thing � that we may remain forever in the shelter of your divine instructions, serving you and your devotees life after life, with sincerity, humility, and gratitude.\n\nMay our hearts always remember your smile, your kirtan, your words of wisdom, and your unwavering faith in Srila Prabhupada and Lord Krishna.\n\nWith deepest gratitude, love, and surrender, we remain �\n\nYour humble and aspiring servants,\n\nShyamkund Das\nBhadrapriya Devi Dasi\nJanakipriya\nBrajanand\nGopika\nand all our Counselees and Congregational Families"

You have shown me the path of Bhakti and meaning to my life.\n\nI came in contact with ISKCON in 1992.\nBeing merciful and compassionate towards college students, your request to Brahmacharis to do college preaching � my college (SIES Sion West Junior College) was first � Radhanath Prabhu (now Srila Bhakti Rasamrita Swami Maharaj) started coming to our college. He took our care like spiritual parents & introduced us to you, Maharaj.\n\nHe started arranging programs at Mr. Murlidhar P. And Adikeshav P.'s house. I was impressed by your speech � your clarity about God, dedication to spiritualism, and strong desire to spread Krishna Consciousness in youth, college students.\n\nIn 1995 I was selected for initiation. I was scared about initiation because my parents were unaware of my Krishna Consciousness and how I would deal with them. I said to my Shiksha Guru that I don�t want to take initiation...\nThat day I went home and I was deeply thinking about initiation. I came to a decision that I should take initiation.\nNext day I came to Radha Gopinath temple and I heard your Bhagavatam class. I wanted to say to you that I want to take initiation, but I was worried that my name must have been canceled from the list. I was roaming around your room. You saw me and said, �Do you want to say something�\n\nI said yes. I told you all that had happened at home, how I had decided to take initiation. Then you asked me, �How old is your father� I said, �47 years.� You just laughed and said, �I am also 47 years; I am your spiritual father.�\nYour name is not canceled.\n\nI am very thankful to you that you have accepted me as your spiritual daughter.\n\nYou are very concerned about me.\nYou guided me in the proper way at the proper time.\n\nIn 1996, I went for Navadvip Mandal Parikrama as a doctor. There, one grihastha devotee told me to come to Mayapur and stay with them � they needed an allopathic doctor.\n\nAfter coming, you asked me how was seva. Then I told you about this. You said, �You be here.�\n\nWhen we shifted to Parbhani, you wrote a letter that you are going for a different mission.\n\nIn 1997 at Parbhani I got a dream that you had come to my place, giving darsana. I had made arrangements for everybody. You said, �I will come one day; make nice arrangements.�\n\nNice arrangements are preaching, and since that time, we have been preaching and assisting your mission.\nI am praying at your lotus feet for serving in Srila Prabhupada�s mission as a servant of servants.\n      .      \nYour Insignificant servant\nSarveshwari devi dasi"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna dear Guru Maharaj, Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet. All glories to you. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nLove is the last word in transcendence. To love means to serve, and to serve means to please. Genuine love is a desire to please without any selfish motivations. The true object of love is Krishna, and Sri Radha is the abode of all love. Being the eternal servants of Sri Sri Radha Govinda, we have the innate need to love and to be loved. Prema pumartho mahan � the highest goal of life is to revive our dormant love for God. Beyond philosophical conviction or scriptural understanding, it is love that invokes the surrender of the heart. One who experiences even a glimpse of a drop of true love for God is overwhelmed with unlimited gratitude and develops a desire to surrender his whole existence for that love.\nDear Guru Maharaj, it is by your mercy and teachings that I finally realized what I was always seeking � genuine love. I�m sincerely grateful, for you have brought me closer to this divine treasure of love for God. You surrendered yourself to the unconditional love of your spiritual master, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. Submerged in an ocean of gratitude for his unconditional love, you have spent every moment of your life in service to his mission unconditionally. Whenever you speak about Srila Prabhupada, your heart erupts with love and gratitude for Srila Prabhupada. You have bestowed your unconditional love upon us, although we are undeserving in every way. You�re doing so much to shower your love upon us. Kartik yatra is a deep illustration of this unconditional love. Your words calmed the storms of doubts and questions raging in our hearts. I heard an incident from HG Vraj Bihari Pr. A boy from the slums of Mumbai, who was very uncivilized, harsh, and ill-mannered due to his unfortunate past and conditions, was transformed in heart by your loving embrace and developed a genuine trace of love for you in his heart. In the same manner, I was an egoistic, narrow-minded, and self-righteous person with no understanding of the purpose of life. But your love has transformed my hard heart, and I have developed a tinge of desire to love you, through which I can love Sri Sri Radha KrishnaChandra someday. I�m eternally indebted for your unconditional love. I wish and pray to forever remain in the shelter of your love, in the shelter of your divine grace.\nLove is very personal. In your offering to Srila Prabhupada on his disappearance day, you said, �If one surrenders to the vani, one gets the association of vapu in the heart � a very deep, personal association.� Without your personal association, there is no hope for my spiritual life. Please bless me so that I approach your vani with the right attitude and personally worship your lotus feet in my heart always. Only a heart fertile with gratitude can recognize and appreciate love. I sincerely wish to cultivate this quality of gratitude so that I can receive your love and strive to reciprocate. I know that the only way we can reciprocate your mercy upon us is to live your teachings � to serve the mission of Srila Prabhupada in the mood of servant of the servant and sincerely take shelter of the holy names. I must admit my weak faith, insincere attitude, and ungrateful heart. On this most auspicious day of your Vyasa-puja, I commit myself to sincerely practice this most glorious path of devotional service to Sri Sri Radha Govinda. Please bless me so that I can execute this desire of mine. Please bless me so that I can serve with unconditional love, without any reservations or malice in the heart. Please bless me so that I can sincerely serve as an instrument of your dear servants, who have brought me to your shelter.\nDear Guru Maharaj, I�m praying for your good health every day. I cannot imagine what would�ve happened to me without your gracious presence in my life. I always yearn to serve under you. I always long to be in your divine association.\nIn deep separation from your lotus feet,\nYour eternal servant,"

Actually, you had once mentioned in one of your lectures that a true devotee of the Lord celebrates the birth of Krishna every moment, since Krishna gets born in his heart every moment. Similarly, we aspire to glorify with all gratitude your presence in our lives every moment, considering every moment to be a milestone moment. Your impact in our daily lives, for whatever one does, has been influenced by your positivity through both vani and vapu. All answers to every possible problem, query, and understanding are embedded in your lectures. These lectures are a one-stop solution or a universal key to open the doors towards spiritual clarity, which can, of course, be implemented as successfully for material aspects too.\n\nMaharaj, it certainly will not be out of place to say that you really �walk the talk�. As a matter of fact, you more than exemplify your teachings through your actions and dealings with all kinds of people. In all these years, we have seen you giving equal mercy and blessings to people irrespective of their caste, creed, economic status, etc. My father, a few months before passing away, did mention that what he saw at Ratna Manjari�s and Priyavrata�s wedding was a pinnacle of genuine love and blessings that they got from the devotees, which was priceless and that no billionaire could have acquired it with all his money. He continued saying that it all converges to your Guru Maharaj.\n\nYour �simple love sacrifice� for bringing the public at large, and especially devotees, closer to the Lord can easily be compared to a biological parent nurturing a child with total affection and a similar level of sacrifice. The only difference is that a parent nurtures two or three kids on an average at one time, while you do thousands.\n\nWe have to just find out at our end how to fully give our hearts to you, even if it is a fraction of what and how you have submitted it to your spiritual master.\n\nWe seek your blessings and prayers for all of us and thank the Lord profusely that He has bestowed into us such a big fortune, personified as H.H. Radhanath Swami, our beloved Guru Maharaj.\n\nYour servants,\nNikunja Behari Das\nRadharanipriya Devi Dasi\nPaavani"

HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj is a true inspiration for everyone, and there are a lot, or maybe endless things to learn from him. I connected to ISKCON Chowpatty in 2019, and every year whenever Maharaj visited the temple, getting his association or even a glance of him felt like a very short period, but this year it was something special. For the very first time, by the mercy of Radha Gopinath, I got the opportunity to attend Maharaj's Kartik yatra, and those seven days were the best days of my life. Every day, getting his association through lectures and kirtan was an eternal bliss. Through his lectures, I got to know there are so many things on which I need to work on myself. Maharaj's teachings on being kind, tolerant, and compassionate towards everyone teach me that even if situations may not be favorable, and there might be differences in opinion while dealing with devotees, our behavior and actions should be very humble. If not, then at least trying to be neutral in such situations is very important. In the yatra, I remember during the Govardhan Annakut festival, when devotees were preparing bhog for the Lord, and it was so, so smoky everywhere, but still, Maharaj came towards each and every devotee. It was such a sweet gesture, and I felt so blessed and fortunate that we are under the guidance of such a great soul who has so much compassion for everyone. I am really grateful that Radha Gopinath has chosen me, and I am a part of this beautiful family. HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki jai."

Dearest Maharaj, you have so many amazing disciples, and I really want to serve your dear disciples in their service to you and Srila Prabhupada.

Whatever little I know about love and surrender, I know through you and want to develop and cultivate it more and more. Thanks again.\n\nYour eternal servant,\nAnanga Kishori"

As this year in the month of May, I got Brahmin initiation by your and my senior devotees' blessings.\nI wanted to tell you that at Laguna Beach temple, I am still learning the pujari seva and I am learning to dress deities. Every time when I dress them, I feel like they are getting ready by themselves. Sometimes Nityananda Prabhuji plays with me; sometimes he hides his bracelets, sometimes his earrings. It is such an amazing experience. I just feel like I should not be in a hurry. I am trying to do the service in a mood of servant of the servant.\nThis year, one big thing happened with me: I got an opportunity to do the 12 am *arati* on the night of Janmashtami. I don�t feel myself eligible for this, but because of the mercy of senior devotees (Ananda Gopika Mataji (my shiksha guru) and our temple president Tukaram Prabhuji), I got this opportunity. I am very thankful to them and Krishna and you.\nGuru Maharaj, I am trying not to commit any offense to Vaishnavas. Thank you, Maharaj, for accepting me as your disciple.

All glories unto you, to Srila Prabhupada, and the entire Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya which you tirelessly represent.\n\nIt is said that the disciple couldn�t ever possibly repay the debt that he owes towards the spiritual master, but it is on occasions like these that he at least makes an insignificant attempt by contemplating and voicing his gratitude.\n\nGuru Maharaj, this year, I have finally been formally connected to our parampara due to your mercy. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I have been waiting for nearly eight years to undergo initiation, with many instances of almost attaining it, but then circumstances changing at the last minute.\n\nI will admit that for the last five years, after my time in the Mayapur Gurukul, I had felt my spiritual consciousness and faith wane, struggling to maintain the same level of enthusiasm and dedication as before. With certain revelations and retrospection of the institution of the Gurukula, as well as witnessing an underlying weary or disengaged attitude towards devotional service from some of my closest gurukul friends, as a result of said revelations; I too felt cynicism and jadedness creep in my heart where simplicity and conviction should be.\n\nStill, I held on to my japa and the four regulations, for I knew that if I let go, things would only drastically worsen. I also wanted to maintain a baseline of spiritual purity because I still hoped to receive initiation from you, Guru Maharaj. How could I shamelessly beg for you to accept me if I didn�t meet the minimum level of commitment My hope to be one day accepted and ultimately become of service to you was a source of sustenance to my malnourished bhakti creeper.\n\nIn essence, Guru Maharaj, I am so very grateful that you have accepted me as your formal disciple. I plan, hope, and pray that I can do something significant for furthering Srila Prabhupada�s mission. Knowing that I have your blessings, it all seems more possible. I apologize that I have rambled on about mainly myself. On this holy day, I should be glorifying you and your divine qualities, yet somehow I ended up talking about myself. I promise that I�ll do a better job next year and every year after that.\n\nYour humble servant,\nGopal Candra Dasa"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n\nMaharaj, today on this auspicious 75th appearance day of your Vyas puja, I can show my utter gratitude at your lotus feet for showing incomparable compassion on a fallen soul like me.\n\nMaharaj, I have been hearing your lectures, and your each lecture is again and again emphasizing on cultivating the pure devotional service which is unconditional, unmotivated, pure love for Lord Hari.\nYou are yourself a representation of pure devotional act. I have seen you, Maharaj, during a New York Snan Yatra this year where you had come to the temple in New York and there were a lot of devotees engaged in carrying out Jagannath Snan Yatra. I was able to see how Jagannath, Subhadra, and Baldev were getting Abhishek and everyone was just engaged in watching that, but Your focus was just Radhakrishna and that shows the pure devotion and utter focus on Vraja Bhakti which you carry in your heart. You did not want to see Dwarkadish Krishna as Jagannath when you can see Radha Krishna in front of you.\nYour mood of devotion is not evoked by Krishna's greatness but by the pure love you have for Krishna as He is. Just like the Vraj Gopis ignored Narayan and just asked where is Krishna, or when Radharani and the Gopis saw Krishna as King of Dwarka during Kurukshetra did not accept Him as king but in their hearts prayed, \"You are the same Shyam Sundar,\" they said, \"and we are the same gopis�but the environment is different. Here, you are majestic, royal, formal. We miss the Shree Krishna who used to steal butter, who used to play the flute in the forests of Vrindavan. Please, come back to Braj with us.\" Same way you are highly focused in seeing Krishna in Vridavan mood, then as Dwarkadish Krishna in Jagannath form.\nTo unlock this Vraj Bhakti, you have been emphasizing the \"key\":\n \n   \nOver and over again. Thus, I am able to see how you are taking us all towards Raganuga Bhakti where love for Krishna is natural and not motivated through following of Shastra injunctions.\nI also thank you, Maharaj, for blessing us with various services here in ISKCON Vadodara and your mood of keeping Krishna�s pleasure first, helping us move on with our service in spite of great difficulties, as we know even with all the difficulties, if we are able to get a small smile on Krishna�s and Radha�s face, that�s success. We found from nowhere Gauranga Prabhu calling us to start Madan Mohan Thali, and we were able to insignificantly serve by providing inputs for the same. And meeting you was just unimaginable reciprocation we could have had.\nI pray that we always remain in the service of Srila Prabhupada�s mission and able to serve you and please you by keeping Krishna�s pleasure first, then our own agenda or pleasures. I pray if I had committed knowingly or unknowingly any offense to your lotus feet, please forgive me, considering me an insignificant servant at your lotus feet.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nNimai Nitai Das"

When I heard about the struggles of your life in your audiobook 'Journey Home', I was at home, and devotees were calling me. The thought immediately came to my mind that when you had found the association of devotees after so many difficulties and struggles, I should not lose this golden opportunity that was coming to me so easily. Thank you so much for guiding me and giving me faith in bhakti.\n\nYour katha is like the current of life for me. If your katha were not there, perhaps the chariot of my devotion would have remained stuck in one place, like a chariot without wheels. No matter how many difficulties come into my life, your katha has that magic that makes me stand up again. Just as a traveler wandering in the desert feels satiated even by a single drop of water, your katha works in my life in the same way.\n\nThe way you focus on the essence of bhakti in your lectures, especially on the mood and attitude with which one should serve, is something I have never heard anywhere else.\n\nMaharaj, during the Kartik Yatra, I saw the magic you have, where all devotees are always enthusiastic to serve. No one serves grudgingly; everyone serves lovingly. Everyone is busy encouraging each other. It was very inspiring to see the values you have imparted to the devotees and the excellent culture that has been established through them.\n\nMaharaj, I have not had much personal interaction with you in my life, nor am I so fortunate. However, I feel a connection with you from many, many lifetimes. I know full well that I am a very fallen, lowly, and sinful soul, always engrossed in sinful activities. It is definitely only by your mercy that I am able to perform whatever little devotion I can.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I am in extreme need of your mercy; otherwise, I do not know when I might lose this opportunity as well. Please accept me as your duly initiated disciple.\n\nMy prayer at your lotus feet is that for the ocean of love that is in your heart for Krishna, Radha Rani, the Acharyas, and Srila Prabhupada, may even a single drop of it arise in my heart. May this heart, which has been a house of garbage for lifetimes, become purified, and may the Lord manifest fully within it. May I have respect and loving friendship for the devotees in my heart, and deep respect for the spiritual masters.\n\nI am currently at a phase in my life from where this life can turn me in any direction, and Maya devi is trying her best to trap me in her illusion. I humbly pray to you to please give me your blessings, accept my prayers, and protect me.\n\nMay I always remain grateful to you and never even have the thought of leaving your lotus feet.

Guru Maharaj, you are changing me as a person, you are changing my desires, and giving me a vision to see this world and all relationships within it. My journey with you started through the \"Journey Home\" book, which had such a profound impact on my heart, as if I had been searching for your shelter for so long.\nLike a mother feeds an infant, you are nourishing me daily with your vani, with the devotees' association I have got, and with the love I am experiencing amongst devotees, which is actually your love coming through them. Thank you, Guru Maharaj, for giving shelter of Radha Gopinath to this struggling soul. You have accepted me as I am. By your mercy, you allow me to be part of your yatras, where I can really relish Krishna consciousness. Like a loving father, you take care of all the details, but most importantly, you give us Krishna. You dive deeper into our consciousness and make us cry and long for Krishna, to call out for His mercy. I feel so grateful and secure in your shelter. I am so far from Krishna, but you have held my hands so tightly and are daily encouraging me to walk towards Him. Guru Maharaj, you are so absorbed in Vrindavan consciousness that it has manifested through your heart as GEV and Radha Gopinath temple. You are my treasure, Guru Maharaj, given to me by Shrila Prabhupada. You have given and taught me so much: the loving, intimate, and selfless dealings among devotees, the culture of hearing and chanting, the mood to always remain a servant of others, and to only long and pray for pure love, for pure devotional service. This is so rare, and by some divine causeless mercy, I have got this rare fortune to be connected to you, to belong to you. What more can I pray for I have got the touchstone. My only desire is that I may become a medium to give pleasure to you, to serve you with my life and soul.\nOn this auspicious day of your divine appearance, I want to seek your blessings.\nGurudev, give me the strength to practice your teachings in my life, even if they seem very heavy, even if they seem impossible in my current state of consciousness. Give me the longing to desire to make your desire my own. Give me the patience to accept myself with my conditioning and tolerate others with their conditioning.\nGive me the strength to practice in my character the ideals you hold so sacred, which by your loving compassion you are teaching me through your words and actions.\nI don't deserve to be called your disciple if I don't strive to practice what you teach me. I have a lot of conditioning, a lot of ulterior desires, but I know they don't define me. I am your daughter and will eternally be. That is the truth.\nSo, Guru Maharaj, change me, change my desires, and let me only long for pure devotional service. Make me hanker to serve others, to pray for them before I do for myself, to think of their spiritual growth before mine, to love without expecting, to live with gratitude, a life of surrender to your lotus feet, and use my life and make me an instrument to preach the glories of the holy name to everyone.\nI know I am very far, but I know you have been holding my hands for so long and will keep doing that. Just don't let me leave those hands which have fed me, nourished me, and patted my back whenever I have fallen. You have been the witness of all my lows, of all my anarthas no one knows about, still, you have not left me. This is true love.\nGurudev, make me like this: to love everyone without judging.\nI am trying and struggling daily with the hope that you, Shrila Prabhupada, and my beloved Radha Gopinath will be proud and very pleased with my struggles one day. With that hope that I am yours, I am not an orphan. I belong to you; give me the strength to practice what you have taught for my whole life and for eternity.\nThank you, Guru Maharaj.\nI am forever yours!\n\nYour daughter,\nHarshita"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nI want to express my deep gratitude to you for everything you have done�not only for your disciples, but for the entire world. I am just an insignificant jiva, yet by your compassion you have given me purpose.\nI still remember the first time I met you in New Vrindavan nearly twenty years ago. All I recall is that you seemed to be glowing, and within my heart I felt an instant attraction. Every devotee knows this feeling upon meeting you. My attraction only grew as I began listening to your lectures. Again and again, at moments of doubt or confusion, the very lecture I heard would give me the answer I was seeking. You have taken on the burden of delivering me by giving me your shelter. Like a compassionate tree, you overlooked my faults and disqualifications and offered me the shade of your lotus feet.\nI have tried my best to follow the instructions you gave at the time of my initiation, though�as a conditioned soul�I have at times fallen short. I pray for the service that will help me assist you in your mission of serving His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.\nBy hearing your lectures, I have taken up the service of book distribution. Though I am not naturally a good speaker or salesperson�and not even a very qualified disciple�I have found great meaning in this service. It has inspired me to read Srila Prabhupada�s books more deeply so that I may answer questions and better share his teachings. My love for reading Srila Prabhupada�s books has grown because of your guidance.\nAlthough we have met only a few times, and even then from some distance, I always feel your presence through your instructions and your lectures. I pray that, birth after birth, I may be blessed with the opportunity to assist you in your service as the servant of the servant of the servant.\nBy your causeless mercy, I was fortunate to attend the last two Yatras. I cannot imagine the immense planning and labor that goes into arranging them so that thousands of devotees may gather together. Your humble and prayerful mood is the ideal all your disciples aspire to follow. In the footsteps of Srila Prabhupada, you have given everything for the upliftment of the world. Nothing we do can ever repay the causeless mercy you show to fallen souls like myself.\nEven though I am full of faults and anarthas, you have given me shelter. In the prayerful mood of Lord Brahma, I beg that you kindly empower all of your disciples for service, protect us from pride, and keep us sheltered from deviation from the path of devotional service. Guru Maharaj, I owe everything to you. I pray that I may become a small, menial instrument in your service to Srila Prabhupada.\nYour unworthy servant,\nVisvanath das"

When I look at my life, I feel deeply what you wrote in The Journey Within:\n�The grace of the guru is the greatest gift in all of creation.�\n\nWithout your causeless mercy, we would remain lost in ignorance, wandering endlessly in the cycle of birth and death. Your teachings have given us direction, purpose, and a gateway to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord.\n\nBy your divine compassion, you have placed us under the shelter of your extraordinary disciples like HG Radheshyam Prabhu, whose guidance continues to shape our efforts here in Seattle. Following their example, more than sixty youth have now been trained in the teachings of rla Prabhupda � and many more are being touched each year.\nWhen I see the God-family here cooking together, serving together, guiding retreats, and working unitedly for the youth, I remember your words from The Journey Home:\n�Real love is expressed through service.�\n\nThis service connects us to you even from afar. Though we are geographically distant, your presence is felt in every devotee who engages in your mission.\n\nThis year holds a special place in our hearts with your visit to Seattle after nine long years. All the God-brothers and sisters came together as one family to serve you. For me personally, the most unforgettable moment was receiving you at the airport and speaking with you about the Seattle ytr. You lovingly inquired about our temple services, the youth programs, festivals, HG Hari Vilas Mahrja�s health, and even about my own family and service.\n\nWhen I mentioned the youth preaching at the University of Washington, your appreciation and encouragement settled deeply into my heart. As you often write:\n�Encouragement is the nourishment of the soul.� (Journey Within)\n\nI was nervous, overwhelmed, speaking with a pounding heart, but that intimate exchange is etched eternally in my memory. I was especially amazed by your careful attention to every detail, every moment of your schedule � a silent lesson in how a true servant of rla Prabhupda remains fully absorbed in service.\n\nI am also very grateful to our Seattle God-family for allowing us to host your Vysa�pj gathering in our home. Your visit filled our house with a spiritual atmosphere that we will never forget. When you spoke to us about the topic, �How to Please the Spiritual Master,� your message pierced our hearts � reminding us of rla Prabhupda�s mood, and echoing what you expressed in The Journey Within:\n�The spiritual master is pleased not by what we do for ourselves, but by what we do for the mission of his Guru.�\n\nThis is your vision - seeing every opportunity as a chance to serve rla Prabhupda. My prayer at your lotus feet is simple:\nMay we serve you in the way that you most want to be served in your service to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nMay we carry forward your mission with sincerity, unity, and dedication.\nAs you write beautifully in The Journey Home:\n�When we live for a higher purpose, every moment becomes sacred.�\n\nOn this sacred day of your Vysa�pj, I pray at the lotus feet of r r Rdh�Gopntha that They bestow upon you long life, health, strength, and the continued ability to uplift the hearts of countless souls of this world.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nBraja Kripa Dasa, Mohini Sundari DD, Tulasi Priya, Manjari Priya"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Gurudev,\n\nPlease accept my obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nNowadays I�m aligning myself to follow your teachings with more emphasis on Vaani than Vaapu. Once Govind Prabhu said Guru Maharaj is someone for whom you don�t have to die for or give your life for. He meant that he is not a leader of a mission where you have to give up your life. He is a teacher. This understanding took me time and now I have realized that I need to understand your message and follow that. Your emphasis on cooperation and how Krishna consciousness is NOT a game of numbers is coming to my limelight. I want to please you and Krishna.\n\nFrom a cooperation front, it�s not only with devotees and the temple, but also with family members and relatives. It�s definitely a challenge, but I want to exercise with your blessings and mercy.\n\nMahavishnu Maharaj was sitting in a corner in a temple in London and reading Srimad Bhagavatam. He was unnoticed. Simply absorbed. Not wanting any recognition. He was simply relishing Srimad Bhagavatam.\n\nFollowing that, Gurudev, I�m seeking your blessings to simply be absorbed in Krishna, not seeking any recognition of any kind, and only to improve my love for Krishna.\nI�m trying to follow your teaching of not judging anyone. Behind each person, there may be a story of abuses, bruises, difficulties which only Krishna knows as the personalized localized super soul. Gurudev, I love you and want to love you more and more.\nI want to hear more and more of your teachings and be a good student.\nI�m grateful for the association extended to us in Mumbai. With the nuclear family model, it�s working out well for our emotional support. We have highly mature counselors who truly care for us to please you and Krishna.\n\nBless me to get more opportunity and mindset to spend more and more time to the point of whole day and night where I can be absorbed in Krishna. Content, intent, and result to all be aligned to please you and Krishna. I need your blessings for the same. Also, I request you to initiate my daughter Rasika Ranganathan, who is a Gopal's Garden student, and bless my son Jaydev Ranganathan, who is in 3rd standard in Gopal�s Garden, to lead a responsible life with LOVE for Krishna. I also beg your blessings for the good health of my son Jaydev Ranganathan and my wife Ayodhyarani devi dasi. With all the good health, we should be able to serve you better and better.\nWith your prayers, we got Jaydev Ranganathan, our son, in BhaktiVedanta Hospital while serving there.

Though you have given clear and simple instructions to keep Krishna in the center of our lives, to serve the devotees with love, and to be an instrument in Srila Prabhupada�s mission, we often fail to follow them. Our mind becomes distracted, our heart becomes lazy, and we forget the purpose of life.

We are pursued by the three modes of nature�the boys symbolizing our lust, anger, and greed�who pelt us with anxieties and beat us with the stick of repeated birth and death. Finally, we fall into the pit of illusion, surrounded by the flames of samsara, burning with regret, fear, and unfulfilled desires�utterly helpless.\n2.\tThe Fire Is Our Existence\nThe blazing fire around the pit is the samsara-davanala�the all-consuming forest fire of material life. From within that pit, our cries for help are weak and distorted, just like the jackal�s painful howls. We cannot save ourselves.\n3.\tLalita Sakhi Is the Guru\nJust as the jackal�s cry reached the merciful ears of Srimati Radharai, our sincere�though feeble�prayers reach you, Gurudeva. You, as Lalita Sakhi, respond to our cries, dispelling the boys of material attachment, extinguishing the fire of suffering with the cool water of your instructions, and lifting us from the darkness of ignorance. Your compassionate glance alone purifies our hearts and fills them with hope.\n4.\tTransformation Through Service\nThe jackal did not become a lion or a swan; she was transformed by mercy into an eternal attendant in Radha-Govinda�s pastimes. Likewise, you teach us that spiritual transformation does not lie in becoming great scholars or powerful preachers, but in embracing our humble position as servants of the servants�finding joy in assisting the Lord�s devotees and delighting in the service of Sri Sri Radha-Govinda.\nGurudeva, just as the jackal was uplifted by the merciful glance of Srimati Radharai, we too�though distracted and undeserving�are being rescued by your compassion and guided by your kirtan. You are personally leading us from the darkness of selfishness into the light of selfless devotion.\n\nWe pray that, like that jackal, we may gain the humility to bow before the devotees, to receive their merciful glance, and to be eternally engaged in the loving service of Srimati Radhika.\nWe have no qualification, no devotion, and no love�but we have your mercy. Please allow us to remain, always, in the mood of that jackal: helpless yet hopeful, unworthy yet uplifted, forever aspiring to be the humble servants of the servants of Srimati Radharai.\n\nThe Soulful Call of Your Kirtan\nWe also wish to offer our heartfelt gratitude for the kirtans you led during the Yatra. They were not mere melodies but divine invocations�soulful calls that pulled our distracted minds toward the Lord. We were reminded of the pastime of Srila Prabhupada in Tompkins Square Park, where through three hours of kirtan he opened his eyes to find hundreds of souls gathered�the holy name itself having awakened their dormant devotion. Similarly, your kirtans are spiritual lifelines; they purify the atmosphere, exhilarate the heart, and connect us to you, to Srila Prabhupada, and to Sri Gauraga in shared transcendental joy. Through them, we feel inspired, grounded, and eager to serve Sri Guru and Gauraga.\n\nYour insignificant servants,\nNavin Gopal das, Swamini Radhika Devi dasi, and Ishwari"

    "Your Offering": "My most humble and heartfelt obeisances at the lotus feet of His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj. Gurudev, on this sacred occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja, my heart is overflowing with emotions that are difficult to express in words. Your divine life, your compassion, your humility, and the unconditional love you shower upon every soul inspire the deepest gratitude within me. Yet, with trembling words and a prayerful heart, I attempt to place my feelings before your lotus feet.\n\nMy spiritual journey truly began on the 5th of October 2024, the day when I first received your divine darshan at Govardhan Ecovillage. That blessed moment transformed something within me in a way I had never experienced before. Your serene presence, gentle glance, and the quiet strength of your love awakened an indescribable attraction in my heart. From that very moment, an earnest desire to one day be accepted as your disciple silently took root within me. That day marked not merely a meeting�but the birth of a new longing, a new direction, a new life.\n\nLast year, I received only a few sacred moments of your association. Even those brief interactions left a deep and lasting impact on my heart. But this year, by your causeless mercy and by the love of the devotees, I was blessed with the extraordinary fortune of spending seven full days in your divine company during the Kartik Govardhan Yatra 2025. Those seven days were not ordinary days; they were divine blessings that cleansed, nourished, and uplifted my soul. Your profound teachings, your heart-melting kirtans, your affectionate glances, and your boundless compassion created a transformation inside me that words cannot fully describe. Each moment in your presence felt like receiving new life. Your association dissolved confusions, quieted anxieties, and filled my heart with devotion and hope. In your presence, Gurudev, I realized that you are not only a teacher�you are the embodiment of pure love, humility, compassion, and Krishna consciousness. Your life itself is a scripture that guides, elevates, and purifies all who come in contact with you.\n\nIn preparation for your Vyas Puja, I took a heartfelt vow to read your sacred autobiography �The Journey Home� three times. Every page of this book reveals the depth of your devotion, the sincerity of your heart, the courage of your spiritual search, and the divine grace that protected and guided you. Reading it does not merely inspire me�it reshapes my inner world. It strengthens my longing to walk the sacred path you have shown, and it fills me with reverence for the journey you undertook for the sake of seeking God.\n\nMy time with you in Vrindavan also remains one of the most precious gifts of my life. Your presence there felt like a gentle breeze carrying the sweetness of Krishna�s eternal abode. The kirtans you led, filled with bhava and devotion; your narrations of divine pastimes; your compassion toward every devotee�all these experiences touched me so deeply that I felt my heart melting and transforming from within. Being in Vrindavan under your shelter felt like entering a sacred space where the soul remembers its true nature.\n\nGurudev, I confess that I am still immature in my spiritual practice. I have many shortcomings and weaknesses. Yet despite my imperfections, I approach your lotus feet with sincerity and a longing for shelter. It is not by my qualification, but only by your causeless mercy that I may someday become worthy of being accepted as your disciple. This is my deepest prayer�that I may serve you with sincerity, follow your teachings with humility, and dedicate my life to your mission. Please bless me with the strength to walk this path steadily, with devotion and gratitude in my heart.\n\nYour 75 years of divine life have brought guidance, love, and Krishna consciousness to thousands of souls around the world. I am one among those souls who has found direction, purpose, and meaning because of your mercy. Your presence is a lamp that illuminates countless lives, and I feel eternally grateful for the light you have brought into mine.\n\nOn this sacred day of your Vyas Puja, I pray from the core of my heart that your health remain strong, your life continue to shine with divine radiance, and your compassion flow forever upon all the souls seeking shelter at your lotus feet. Gurudev, may my life become an offering to your mission. May every breath of mine remember your kindness. And may I always remain your servant.\n\nYour aspiring servant, your aspiring disciple,\nPrathamesh Digambar Adhav"

I am not attempting to be humble, but that is the true story. Having you in my life is a true privilege for me.

But you very well clarified in your fifth instruction about what will please you.\n\nAlong with that, the other four are very important. You have already shown all those qualities by inspiring a large Chowpatty community, and your service attitude to please Srila Prabhupada is not a hidden secret.

    "Your Offering": "Please accept my humble obeisances, Maharaj.\nThe first book that I received when I came to Krishna consciousness was �Journey Home�. Surprisingly, it was my birthday, and I would say this is the best gift I have ever received. You take us through different levels of religion and spirituality through your own journey in your book. You finally take us to the ultimate platform of Vraja Bhakti. You are a true Vrajavasi, as evident in your deep attachment to Sri Vrindavan Dham. You have given us Vrindavan in the form of GEV. Vrindavan in your heart has manifested outside as GEV. Your constant emphasis in lectures is pure devotional service of the highest standard. You are a lover of Krishna, and you want us to also love Krishna and be happy.\nMaharaj, you very much emphasize two qualities: humility and gratitude. Your every lecture begins by expressing gratitude to the audience. You teach us how grateful we should be to Srila Prabhupada for the hardships he has taken for uplifting us. You teach us to be grateful to everyone who is helping in our service to the Lordships. Almost in every lecture, you speak about humility, �trnad api sunicena.� You don�t speak it but live by it; it is your life and soul, a personal instruction from your spiritual master. You write your designation, not a sanyasi, but a servant in the record book of GEV. As Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur would say, �daso �smi� to his disciples when they would pay obeisances. Maharaj, you don�t consider devotees who are serving you personally as your servants. One person wanted to give something to Maharaj. He asked, 'Can I give it to your servants' Maharaj replied, 'You can give it to them, but they are not my servants.' In the Satsang program in 2023 at Pune with HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj, HH GKGM gave a lecture for more than an hour, and you then spoke for 15 minutes, and that too only about the glories of HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj.\nMaharaj, you want ISKCON to be a united family. The culture of love and devotion that you have created at ISKCON Chowpatty is adored throughout the ISKCON world. You have given so much inspiration to devotees to remain united through lectures, through yatras. The Kartik Yatra is the most awaited time of the whole year for all the devotees who seek shelter and inspiration in you.\nWe are very, very thankful to you, Maharaj, for giving us HG RSP. Because of HG RSP, we got connected to the glorious movement of Srila Prabhupada and were saved from the perils of the material world. We are very fortunate to receive this opportunity to serve in the mission of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. We pray to you, Maharaj, to accept us as humble servants at your lotus feet. May we be able to serve in the mission of Srila Prabhupada lifelong.\nYour insignificant servant,\nKamal Kishore Upadhyay"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna\nRespected Maharaj\n\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada\n\nThis is our first offering to you Maharaj after initiation, which happened last year on December 27. We feel more connected to you and Sri Guru Parampara, praying daily on the beads you had kindly chanted upon. Although there is a deep sense of satisfaction for myself, yet, I feel sad for the devotees who missed initiation, which was scheduled for the next day. So many devotees who were much more qualified than me should have received shelter, at least before me. They were waiting for the next day.\n\nYet there is a positive aspect too. By Srila Prabhupada's grace, so many devotees are\neager to surrender to chanting of the Holy Names. The preaching is increasing, and thus ISKCON as a society is also growing! And I feel very grateful for the efforts you have put in, from the very beginning of accepting Krishna Consciousness to the advanced age today�we always see you tirelessly serving Srila Prabhupada and his divine instructions.\n\nTaking so much effort, every single year you have taken Kartik yatra for all of us. This one festival of coming together, leaving aside (as much as possible) all our worries and anxieties over petty issues of life, and taking our time for pure Krsna Katha and seva to devotees, is a panacea for continuing us year after year. Hearing from you, we understand how easily we forget the most basic principles of Krishna Consciousness! But it is to our great fortune to be reminded by the words emanating from your lotus mouth. My only wish is to have my consciousness purified by these words and instructions.\n\nGuru Maharaj, in trying to serve in our respective teams, we are also now getting exposed to more and more of the organizational side of ISKCON. Unfortunately, long gone are our days when we were new, thinking everyone to be a pure devotee. Now every single incidence and every involved devotee no longer feels perfect, either within the team or across various teams and various leaders. The issues we face within our team are still overcome, thanks to the able guidance of our seniors, who are following your footsteps. But now, growing up in society, there are more organizational challenges being faced with other teams.\n\nThis year (the third time in three years) we see a similar situation evolving, where all our efforts are put on toss for some little misunderstanding or underlying emotions against us. As a team, we have suffered various setbacks earlier, and only by the causeless grace of the Lord were we able to come out of these. Yet repeated failures, born not directly out of our mistakes, are deeply saddening. And as we understand, this is because of the material attachments which these leaders bring into devotional service: attachments like possession of money and land, ruling over followers and properties, and needless to mention, strong non-KC attachments for wife, children, and family.\n\nIt is certainly because of my imperfect vision towards devotees. And the very reason I am pointing this out is because these issues exist within my very self. Swearing on our beads, I don't share this to complain, Maharaj, but only for the reason that a child can cry to his parents. And also, because these setbacks make devotees go through enormous pain. Please pray for these of your crying children, Maharaj. We need strength to carry on following your footsteps. Attachment to your lotus feet is certainly the perfection that will fulfill all our desires. For not only are your lotus feet our shelter, but they have shown the path to walk on the thorny roads of this material world. We have faith; if we stick to the example you have led, we will one day be able to please Sri Sri Radha Krishna.\n\nMaharaj, I feel the need of your blessings, mercy, and prayers even more than ever. On this auspicious occasion of Sri Vyas Puja, I also beg for forgiveness for the countless offenses I have committed at your lotus feet. Please save us from the very anarthas that we are realizing in ourselves. Please award us the service to Vaishnavas.\n\nI also pray to always feel this dependence upon you every moment and aspire forever to serve your lotus feet.\n\nYour servant"

You have totally influenced me with all your qualities. Your simplicity, humility, foresight, lectures, and knowledge on the shastras, answers to questions, everything is so exemplary that not only me but anyone who meets or hears you once will be a fan of yours. So elaborating any of the qualities is like showing a lamp to the sun.\n\nSince we are not so fortunate to see you often, the one thing which we get abundantly is your vani. I have been listening to your classes for years now. Every lecture is a masterpiece in itself. There is so much clarity and depth in the subject that even a fool like me is able to understand the message and outcome. You pour out your heart in every lecture to make it so easy to understand for us. I wonder how much pain you take to prepare for the classes so that it is easily understandable to all of us. When we speak to other disciples of ISKCON Gurus, they also have the opinion that the way you explain the subject matter in your classes is unparalleled. Particularly when you speak about Gaur Lila, it goes to a different level. Your classes on the life and pastimes of Gauranga Mahaprabhu are not lectures; they are live commentaries. In Mahabharat, Sanjaya was given divya drishti to see and describe the Kurukshetra war. I am sure you have been empowered with the same divya drishti by Prabhupada and Guru parampara to look into the past in the time of Gauranga Mahaprabhu. The way you describe every minute detail is unbelievable; it cannot happen unless one is physically present there. It seems you can talk endlessly for hours and days on the life and glories of Mahaprabhu. More than that, every time we listen to the same lectures, there is some different realization which we might have missed the last time. Please bless me so that I can increase my taste in the holy name and be able to serve in the mission of Prabhupada.\n\nWe pray to Radha Madhav to bless you with good health so that we are able to have your association and listen to the nectarian lectures in the decades to come.\n\nYour aspiring Servant,\nSumanta Ghosh"

When Srila Prabhupada teaches us, he explains that we cannot see Krishna with our material eyes. And now I understand�out of His mercy, Krishna sends the Guru into our lives so that through the Guru we can feel His presence. Still, even then, we are not able to truly see you as you really are, but whatever little we can perceive is only by Krishna�s kindness upon us.\nThat is when I realized why the Guru is said to be Krishna. Earlier, I could not understand this�I just accepted it out of respect but never felt it deeply. Now I feel it�Guru is Krishna, and you are my Krishna.\nI�m sorry, Maharaj, but when I feel for you, I even understand the real meaning of some Bollywood songs�for example, �Tera mujhse hai pehle naata koi, yun hi nahi dil lubhata koi.� \nYour appearance day is very special for all of us.

I never imagined that I would ever believe in all this, but when I experienced it, I realized�it is pure magic.\nYou have showered so much mercy on me, Maharaj�more than I could ever expect. You have given me far beyond what I deserve�like putting a diamond in the hands of a beggar.\nNow it is my turn, Maharaj. Please bless me so that I can somehow pay back your mercy by walking on your path, always respecting you and everyone else, becoming a good person, and practicing bhakti sincerely. I am not able to do much on my own, but with your help, I know I can.\nI often think to myself�will I ever be able to repay the mercy that you, Srila Prabhupada, and Krishna have given me Will I ever be able to practice bhakti properly Sometimes I worry�what if I make some mistake\nMy mentor once told me that anyone who comes to bhakti, anyone who comes close to Krishna�even if they get distracted or go far away�eventually returns. Krishna Himself brings them back. And because people say that the Guru is Krishna Himself, I feel the same about you. If I ever wander away or become weak, you will bring me back to the right path, won�t you You won�t let me get lost, right You will bring me back to you, back to the path of bhakti.\nI know I trouble you a lot with my prayers and persistence, but what can I do�nothing happens without your mercy.\nMaharaj, I sincerely pray that Krishna blesses you with strong health, long life, and unlimited protection. So many people receive mercy, guidance, and hope because of you�including a sinful and fallen person like me.

On this occasion, I pray to Guru Parampara and Their Lordships and Srimati Radharani to keep you in good health for many, many years to come. And because of that, we will have the opportunity to listen to your instructions from your lectures and Nectarian Harinam Sankirtan every day.\n\nAlso, I pray at your lotus feet that, by your divine arrangements, I may be saved from any mistakes, deficiencies, and Aparadha while doing service in Srila Prabhupada's Mission. Guru Maharaj, please bless me to do the service in the mood of Dasanudas.\n\nYour Insignificant Servant of Servants,\nPrem Nityanand Das"

    "Your Offering": "Please accept my humble obesiances, dearest Gurudev.\nHare Krishna, dearest Gurudev.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nAll glories to you, Sri Gurudev, and all glories to Sri Gauranga.\nMy Vyas Puja offering to you, dearest Gurudev 2025.\nI am not qualified to write truly!\nBut will try to share a few words with you.\nTo dearest Gurudev,\nHappiest Vyasa Puja to you�\nHappiest Krsna conscious appearance day to you, �r Guru Caraa Padma��(�The lotus feet of our spiritual master are the only way��)..Hare Krishna to you, Hare Rama to you, Hare Krishna to you, dear Gurudev, Hare Rama to you, �lots of dandwat pranams at your feet..\n\n� When a desire of a pure devotee comes true�!!!\n\nWhen a desire of a pure devotee comes true, it makes wonders. Since many years, Gurudev, you had a desire to have Kartik Yatra to Govardhan, but due to lack of accommodation, it did not happen. The best yatra ever had, and this year it came true by your blessings. Not even a drop of rain we faced for 7 days, though it was raining in Vrindavan and Mathura. Govardhan was above our heads, truly as it was during Lord Krsna's holding Govardhan. Seven days, seven nights, the Govardhan lila happened; it was the same for us, just because of you, beloved Gurudev. Fortunately, I had an opportunity to come for the yatra. Please bless me; till my last breath, may I get a chance to attend all your Kartik Yatras, your association may I get, I may learn to serve, and always be part of the solution. Also, Gurudev, I could have such a great spiritual opportunity, full of blessings and mercy, to be in dham for Kartik Yatra 2025. A word, \"thank you,\" is very small in front of your infinite blessings and mercy. We really love you.\n\n� Thanking you from the bottom of my heart�!!!\n\nWith a very happy heart, I would like to thank you infinitely for the Kartik Yatra 2025 at Govardhan. Luckily, my room was near Govardhan. Every morning, while coming towards the pandal, the first darshan would be of Govardhanji. Then, after offering a lamp to him, I would head towards the pandal. It would be so inspiring. After Mangal Aarti, Tulsi Aarti, and Japa session, I could get your holy association japa, and then we would go for the temple darshan in the morning. Short class, then evening your lectures would be so enlivening that I would feel it should never stop. Huge number of devotee association, blessings of great senior disciples of Srila Prabhupada, also yours was full mercy of Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. Many times, I have seen and observed, you love everyone truly, especially I have seen that you have so much love, respect, and care for your god brothers and sisters. Please bless us; may we have the same between our god brothers and sisters. Every yatra is full of learnings. Please bless, Gurudev; may it keep coming like the mercy may continuously flow on us.\n\n� Your mercy truly guarded us�!!!\n\nIt was raining in Mathura and Vrindavan. Full 7 days, but Krishna truly held the umbrella for all of us for all 7 days of the Yatra!!! Like He held it during Govardhan lila (Govardhan Giridhari, Krsna holds Govardhan for 7 days and nights to protect his devotees from Samvartaka clouds�pralaya clouds sent by Indra. Indra couldn't identify his boss, Supreme Krsna. Such is the power, potency of the beloved Lord, Yog Maya of Supreme Krsna). By your grace, we didn't even get rain while returning back home to material life.\n\n� Causeless mercy in the form of a golden chance.!!!\n\nI am very happy to know that this year, by your causeless mercy, all got a chance to write offerings for you on this special day of your �Vyasa Puja� and it was announced that the temple RGM community will be compiling *Vyas Puja Book* as an offering for you, dear Gurudev, on *75th appearance day* of yours, where in devotees can send their Vyasa Puja Offerings to you through this Google form, https://forms.gle/BSdYwzEHx66nxTdf6.\nI am not qualified to write, but I want to wish you and thank you for everything on your special day, so I grabbed this opportunity.\n\n� Wish to share what inspired me the most from your spotless class�!!!\n\nGurudev, recently I heard one of your old lectures where you mentioned about how a king's haunted daughter's body, a ghost left the movement. Ramanuja Acharya kept his feet on the girl's head; immediately the ghost left her body, never to return. I was very inspired to hear how when pure devotees even touch, it can make wonders. Your recorded lectures are often discussed. I draw inspiration from them, and a compilation of your own, full of nectar lectures, which is available in the tape named Kathamrita Sindhu, which is a collection of your teachings. Really, this tape made my life. Being in a situation, it got the better, best way, which taught how to always remember Krsna, never forget Krsna. Thanking you and Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, I could get a chance this birth to hear such a systematic creation, that is this tape. Really thankful for this Kathamrita Sindhu. Please keep compiling the same in the future; may we get a chance to hear all your past, present, future lectures, at least at one place after Sri Sri Radha Gopinath temple. That's this kind of tape, Rg Media�Kathamrita Sindhu (Nectarean Ocean of Hari Katha) Vol 1, Theme-wise Collection of Audio Classes, which has 1300+ audio, 3000+ hours. Everyone may get a chance to hear. All your lectures, kirtans, bhajans, especially kalikukkura, holy name chanting, the best, infinity stars for it. Few years ago, I really had a strong desire to have something like Srila Prabhupada tape; your lectures to be in it. Finally, it's here. Similarly, Gurudev, whatever I had in life, have in life, will have in life is your mercy, your credit for which I wish to thank you infinitely. Please keep your mercy always. Lots of love, respects, obesiances to you, dearest Gurudev.\n\n� Your mercy truly keep it continuously. Please bless, Gurudev�!!!\n\nPlease bless me as this inborn talent, like I can sing bhajans, kirtans. In our counseling meetings, devotees' homes, or earlier in our kirtan melas, different big institutes, sometimes I get to do leading kirtan seva. Everyone praises me. At that time also, till the date, it's your blessings and Sri Sri Radha Gopinath's mercy completely that I was given a chance to serve. Doing nothing, I got all praises. You know, Gurudev, once I was at a very famous institute, in the presence of the owner and everyone connected to them, where many dignitaries were also present. We had to show our unique talents. So, at that time, I sang the bhajan \"Ohe Vaishnav Thakkura Dayara Sagara.\" Before it, I just prayed at your feet, and before I began, I shared a few spiritual thoughts to make them a little comfortable with what I was going to do, along with the name of Srila Prabhupada and the band The Beatles. Everyone there was dancing in the kirtan. They were shouting, \"Once more, once more!\" They felt it was unique, never heard such slow, then fast dancing beats, kind of a song which I played with kartal and a plastic chapli (cymbal). They praised me like anything. A small token of a gift I gave them, Sri Sri Radha Gopinath's photos and prasad. At that time, I was missing you because all I got was your blessings. Other talents, intellect, and much more, everything. I may not be proud and always remain humble. All this should help me grow in Bhakti and preaching mission. This may add betterment for preaching the mission. Please bless, may I use my everything in the service of the Lordships, devotees, your service, Gurudev, also get the devotee qualities which will help me more in Bhakti, go closer to devotees, Krsna, then finally the place which is full of bliss, full of eternity. Please bless; let me be able to do something for the mission of Srila Prabhupada and the society. Begging your blessings.\n\n* A small sweet poem for you, dear Guru Maharaj *\n\n**At your lotus feet I bow, O master kind and true,**\n**Through every word and gentle smile, Ka�s mercy flows from you.**\n**You teach us how to chant with love, to serve with heart and grace,**\n**And by your boundless compassion, we glimpse the Lord�s sweet face.**\n**O guide of my wandering soul, please keep me near your side�**\n**In your shelter lies my fortune, in your footsteps, all my pride.**\n\nLots of love, obesiances at your feet. May your mission complete and flourish forever.\nHarekrsna dandwat pranam, dearest Guru Maharaj.\nGurudev, yours and only yours.\nPlease forgive me if I spoke much or beyond my limits.\nKeep your blessings on me, my family, forever grateful to you.\nYour servant, your daughter, your unworthy disciple,\nSneha Gopi Devi Dasi."

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krsna dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my most humble obeisances.\n\nOn this very auspicious day of your Vyasa puja, I wish to express my gratitude and love to you for everything you have given me.\n\nThis Kartik yatra to Govardhan had been unforgettable for me, as you rightly wanted it to be. Though only for two and a half days, the times spent with you and our greater Vaishnava family gave me much to cherish and value.\n\nAs yatra is the only time I get to meet and hear directly from Your Grace and other senior devotees and my counselor, I especially value this yatra a lot.\n\nI saw yourself and the seniors extending to such incredible limits. I feel insufficient in reciprocating to your compassion. But there is a desire to share it on to others, as what I have received from yourself is so nourishing and satisfying to the soul.\n\nA wonderful interaction that I see as your mercy was HG Gauranga Prabhu's class during Apsara Kund visit. Prabhuji was explaining how a disciple's relation with the Spiritual Master goes beyond the limits of this limited lifetime. So the disciple should be ready to tolerate and persist beyond lifetimes. That day, by your mercy, I dedicated all my future births also at Your Lotus Feet. I beg you to accept me as your property eternally and engage me as you wish.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, as an aspiring disciple, Your ideals and principles like humility and Vaishnava seva are fit for a perfect devotee, and I see that I am light years away from your expectations. But I promise to strive and work hard to be your worthy servant. Other than Your blessings due to your causeless mercy, I don't see any other way it could actually happen.\n\nAs an extremely sick patient requires most attention from the doctor, similarly I beg for your grace and blessings, as my condition is very fallen. Other than my desires and life, I don't have anything else to repay you. I am eternally grateful to Srila Prabhupada for having given me in your care.\n\nThank you very much dear Guru Maharaj,\nAspiring to be your humble servant,\nKrishna Priya"

Your smile feels like a cool breeze to my existence and has the ability to heal wounds.

Please have mercy. I don't know how to approach Krishna and Radharani, or I don't feel any love for them. But I know you feel love for Them, and through you, I can feel it someday.

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna dear Maharaj! Please accept my humble pranams!\n\nMaharaj, I am writing my heartfelt feelings to you without much thought because when you talk to your dear ones, you do not calculate things in mind and write officially! I am just trying to say a few simple words to express my gratitude.\n\nLast year, very mercifully, you took me also under your divine shelter despite being unqualified unlike all your other disciples. This reminds me how Lord Chaitanya gave mercy to most unqualified candidates also. I have no spiritual background, neither do I come from a devotee family, nor did I ever attend any Hari katha before coming into ISKCON. But still, carrying forward Srila Prabhupada�s compassion, you are giving shelter to many souls.\n\nInitially, I was not sure how to know who my spiritual master is. I always thought he should be the one with whom I can personally meet and discuss and take instructions. Otherwise, how will He know my struggles, strengths, weaknesses, etc. And that seemed like a far possibility with you, Maharaj. And that still remains the reality today as well. But while interacting with some of your disciples who are senior to me, I realized how you are always deeply connected with all your disciples who are committed to their vows. How you are personally involved in their lives and blessing them although they are physically very far from you. There are innumerable such pastimes to list a few. You gave hope to Vrindavan Prabhu when he wanted to end his life, saying that You need him. You took care of some disciples, [mtjs] like a loving father. You arranged for some very eager devotees who were financially incapable of joining yatras. You personally prayed for a young [mtj] disciple who just got initiated by you and immediately after that met with an accidental death.\n\nMany such instances made me realize that the connection is always very strong from your end. It is the disciple�s responsibility to connect by following the instructions given in classes and initiation vows sincerely. But for doing that also, I need your blessings, Maharaj. I need blessings to chant for your and Krishna�s pleasure, to read and absorb Srimad Bhagavatam and Chaitanya Charitamrit, to hear your kathas and imbibe the essence in my dealings. I remember how in one class you said, �Hearing means willingness to follow.�\n\nYour words, �Every situation is an opportunity to remember and surrender to Krishna, and it is Krishna�s divine arrangement to bring us closer to Him,� give me faith and determination to face all the situations and adversities that come on my way. Maharaj, on your Vyas Puja day, this unqualified disciple has nothing to offer to you except a promise that I am trying hard to follow your instructions with the hope that one day I will please you and my life will be perfect! To share my deepest desire with you, Maharaj, I really want to serve you in fulfilling the mission of Srila Prabhupada to spread the glories of devotional service to the best of my capacity. I seek blessings and empowerment to become a little instrument in your hands if you so desire.\n\nBegging for your mercy always,\nYour insignificant disciple,\n�Priti Radha Devi Dasi"

I met Maharaj at Indore airport about 1 year ago (in September) and only for a period of 10-15 minutes. That day, with His loving and compassionate glance, He blessed me with so much mercy. In that moment, I realized that there is something so different about Him that I have never felt for anyone.\n\nHe is so merciful that despite me not being an initiated devotee, He has made His presence felt in my life so many times. He has given me faith that He is always listening to me and watching over me. Despite His mercy, I fail every day in executing whatever insignificant service I am doing for Krishna. And despite me failing, He still makes His presence felt in my life. How glorious is His mercy.\n\nI don�t know what Srila Prabhupada, Sri Sri Panchatattva, and Sri Sri RadhaShyamsundar have planned for me. But I pray and desire that I may be able to attain the shelter under the most auspicious lotus feet of Dear Maharaj. And as His disciple, serve the Vaishnavas in the mood of the servant of the servant of the servant of the lotus feet of Krishna.\n\nYour servant, a fallen soul aspiring to serve Srila Prabhupada�s mission,\nKrishni Tiwari"

    "Your Offering": "Respected Guru Maharaja, Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\nAll glory to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to Sri Sri Guru and Gauranga.\n\nGuru Maharaj, you are a sincere follower of Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nSo, there is a verse from SB, which glorifies the Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu but you are a sincere follower of Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu so it applies to you also\n\ntyaktv su-dustyaja-surepsita-rjya-lakm\ndharmiha rya-vacas yad agd arayam\nmy-mga dayitayepsitam anvadhvad\nvande mah-purua te cararavindam (SB 11.5.34)\n\nIt states that Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave up his beautiful young wife and all opulence which are aspired by even heavenly demigods and which is very difficult to give up. Similarly, you are born in America and have opulence, but you gave up opulence which is aspired by many people.\n\nBeing cursed by a brahmana, Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave up family life and took Sannyas. Similarly, you don't want to take sannyas, but by the divine arrangement of the Lord, you gave up everything and took sannyas. Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu traveled all over South India to save conditioned souls from the mirage of material happiness. Similarly, you are traveling all over the world to save people from the glittering happiness of material existence. So, I offered my obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a sincere follower of Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nIn Shrimad Bhagavatam, in the Dhruva Maharaj section, there is a verse that describes the qualities of a devotee who was going back home, back to Godhead.\n\nnt sama-da uddh\nsarva-bhtnura�jan\nynty a�jascyuta-padam\nacyuta-priya-bndhav (SB 4.12.37)\n\nPeaceful persons, equipoised, cleansed and purified, and who know the art of pleasing all other living entities, keep friendship only with devotees of the Lord; they alone can very easily achieve the perfection of going back home, back to Godhead.\n\n1) Peaceful - Guru Maharaj, while you were traveling for searching your inner call, you came across many instances where you had opportunities for sense gratification, but you kicked them. In Kandhar, a woman was forcing you for sense gratification, but you ran away from there and escaped from the hands of her bodyguard. This shows how peaceful you are in the core of your heart.\n\n2) Equipoised - When HG Braj Bihari Prji was preaching in the slum area of Bombay, at that time, a boy used to come for the program, but he was speaking loose language and exhibiting bad behavior. But once that boy came to the temple for a program, and you saw that boy and embraced him, then that boy got totally changed and started coming to the temple and bringing flowers for you. This shows how you see the eternal soul behind everyone and not their external situations.\n\n3) Purified - Guru Maharaj, you chant the holy name intensely, sincerely, and absorbingly, which shows how much purified you are. And not only that, but you are inspiring many people to chant the holy name and serve Krishna, which is the mission of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, which shows how much purity you carry by the mercy of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\n4) Art of pleasing all other living entities - Guru Maharaj, in GEV you kept some restricted area for animals, in which you brought donkeys. Those donkeys first didn't come near you and were fearful, so you told devotees to take care of them nicely. They were fearful because they were harassed so much. When you came next time, then the donkeys were embracing you, and you were happy. That shows that you know the art of pleasing all living entities, including animals also.\n\n5) Keep friendship only with devotees of the Lord - Maharaj, you keep friendship with devotees, and whoever comes in contact with you becomes a devotee or at least starts the journey of spiritual life. Once you went for a program in Scion Medical College, no students came because of a cricket match. Meanwhile, a student came for the washroom and happened to meet you in the seminar hall. Then you dealt with him nicely by asking how the match was going and talking with him for 5 minutes and giving him invitations to Chowpatty Temple. He came regularly and later on became a devotee and then he became your disciple and joined as a full-time Brahmachari servant in the Temple. This is how you make friends with devotees.\n\nThis shows that by taking dust from your lotus feet, we have started the journey back home, back to Godhead.\n\nGuru Maharaj, your life is itself a guidebook for me, so I consider Journey Home as one of the guidebooks for my life. So, I want to mention some incidents from my life where I took inspiration.\n\n1) When I passed out after training for one year in the Brahmachari Ashram, my authority told me to go to the sankirtana book distribution bus, but it was difficult for me because there was no fixed prasadam and location. Then I remembered that your authority gave out a difficult order to do six aartis in a day and at night doing Kirtan, still, you didn't say no. By observing your dedication, I decided to follow my authority, and it was the most blissful experience of my life in the sankirtana bus party.\n\n2) While in the Sankirtan bus, one day we didn't get proper accommodation, so we stayed in an open space with grass nearby. When the next day morning I woke up, one devotee told me not to go this side because he saw a big snake there. So, I was fearful; how can I go for nature's call But I remembered that how once in 1971, when you first visited Vrindavan and while living in Barsana, in one morning you went for nature's call and saw a big snake just ready to bite you. In that dangerous situation, you chanted the holy name with great sincerity, and then the snake went away. By remembering this situation, I could go for nature's call and chanted the holy name sincerely.\n\nThis is how, Guru Maharaj, your life always keeps inspiring me in my devotional service in many instances.\n\nIn one place, I read that the Vani of the Spiritual Master is a constant companion for the sincere disciple. So, daily I try to hear your classes.\n\n1) Once when I came from my job and was taking prasadam in the evening while hearing your class, but I was not happy with the quality of prasadam, so in my mind, I was thinking badly about the cook devotee and offending the Lord in the form of prasadam. But right at that moment, a voice came from your class, 'Don't discriminate prasadam by your material intelligence; after millions of births, we are getting this mercy of the Lord in the form of prasadam.' Then I immediately changed my mind and became grateful to the cook devotee and prasadam.\n\n2) Once, a desire for sense gratification came to my mind, but at the same time, I was hearing your class, so the voice came from your class, 'As soon as you desire to enjoy material sense gratification, all the miseries of material existence start following you.' Then I became alert and tried to intensify my devotional service.\n\nThis is how I could realize that the Vani of the Spiritual Master is a constant companion for a sincere disciple.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I need your Mercy to follow your teachings and instructions, which is a life-long project for me.\nSpecifically, bless me to follow this verse:\n\ntd api su-ncena\ntaror iva sahiun\namnin mna-dena\nkrtanya sad hari\n\nI joined full-time to serve you and Shrila Prabhupada's mission until my last breath, but I am going through some opposition. Please, please, and please give me your mercy so that I can pass these obstacles in my spiritual journey towards the lotus feet of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nI pray at the lotus feet of Shri Shri Radha Rasbhihariji and Gaur Nitai for your good health and your association.\n\nThank you very much, Guru Maharaja, for all the great gifts that you have given us. We hope, someday, we will offer you at least one millionth of what you have done for us. Hare Krishna.\n\nYour Insignificant Servant\nSundar Hari Das"

I was firmly getting immersed in a dark, intoxicating, and bewildering state, not knowing what to do. I was just busy hearing lectures from so-called bogus Gurus who didn't have self-realization. I was thinking this was life � to get intoxicated and enjoy life before it passes by.\n\nBut one day, you came into my dreams after I attended a Sunday feast class and happened to sit right in front of you, by devotees who forcefully made me sit. I had no clue who you were. I had seen you for the first time, and when you were passing by, devotees were bowing down. I also did that because your Lotus Feet were very near to me. We had an eye-to-eye contact, and you gave me a good, smiling gesture. Ever since then, I found Sunday feasts interesting and started a new journey.\n\nGurudev, in today's world, people, men, women, and even small children are addicted to dirty means of engaging their minds and wasting time. And there are bogus Gurus who fuel their so-called desires and end up killing the harmony. When I go back, I feel I am so fortunate, so lucky. What good karma I must have done, or which soul has been so kind to me to give me the fortune of being connected with ISKCON. Ever since I met you, my heart always cries with love and happiness. I think if you weren't there in my life, I would be in the most degraded condition.\n\nEven in today's time, there are many unfortunate souls who don't realize their fall from the spiritual world. They don't even realize where they are heading. And when I see my past, you inspire me with your most beautiful smile on earth today.\n\nI am proud of you, Gurudev \n\nHare Krishna! I pray to the Lord on this auspicious day for your best health and abundance of Krishna Prema.

All glories to Srila Gurudeva.\n\nIt feels daunting to speak of your glories, as I am acutely aware of my own limitations. Anything I say about Srila Radhanath Maharaj seems like �small mouth, big talk��I am not worthy to describe your greatness, for you embody the qualities of a true sadhu whose life is dedicated to serving others. Yet, following my counselor�s advice and seeking purification of my own heart, I offer these words.\n\nYou personify all Vaishnava qualities, and as I reflect on each, I see your perfection in them. In this offering, I would talk about your exemplary leadership�always leading from the front, living every instruction you give. Recently, I heard the top five instructions you shared with your followers on your 75th birthday:\n\n1/ Go deep into hearing, chanting, and service:\nNo one exemplifies depth in spiritual practice as you do. When I chant Hare Krishna, I utter words; when you chant, you invoke Krishna�s presence. Your attention to detail in every service for Krishna�s pleasure is inspiring.\n\n2/ Cultivate the mood of pleasing Guru and Krishna:\nYour life�s purpose is to please Krishna, a commitment evident since your childhood and strengthened after accepting Srila Prabhupada as your Guru. Stories shared by Vrindavan Prabhu in his book to glorify you mention how you delivered lectures and served even in great pain, demonstrating your unwavering desire to please Guru and Krishna.\n\n3/ Remain united as a community:\nYou lead by personal example, caring for your Godbrothers and Godsisters, attending to every need, and serving with your full capacity.\n\n4/ Enthusiasm in Bhakti to share Krishna consciousness:\nThe annual yatras, attended by 10,000�12,000 devotees, are a testament to your enthusiasm and compassion to spread this knowledge. It is very inspiring to see that you are personally overseeing every detail and delivering hours-long classes daily, even at an age when most cannot sit for minutes.\n\n5/ Never forget that Bhakti is about quality, not quantity:\nYou never compromise on quality, infusing it into every aspect of your service, stretching yourself daily to serve devotees selflessly.\n\nGiven my position, I feel unqualified to write these words and am sure I make many mistakes due to my false ego. Please forgive me.\n\nSrila Gurudeva, though I am unworthy, I rely on your magnanimity. Please accept this most fallen servant and shower your causeless mercy upon me, for without it, I have no hope. I am in great need of your blessings and seek your encouragement/push to progress on this path of devotion.\n\nYour fallen servant,\nAmit Tantia"

    "Your Offering": "td api suncena taror api sahiun\namnin mnadena krtanya sad hari\n\nThis verse from Siksastakam truly defines the real characteristics of our beloved Guru Maharaj � HH Radhanath Swami. He is the living encyclopedia of sastras � the personified �Vyakti Bhagavatam�. Still, he is as humble as a blade of grass on the street which does not want any recognition. Guru Maharaj is a true role model when it comes to humility, and he wants his disciples and followers to keep the humble attitude no matter how elevated he or she becomes in practicing Krishna Consciousness principles.\n\nOur Guru Maharaj is transcendental to the three modes of material nature, beyond the bodily concept of life. Therefore, he remains equipoised amidst the dualities of life: happiness & distress, heat & cold, profit & loss, honor & dishonor, etc. He is as tolerant as a tree and preaches the same tolerant attitude to his disciples and followers.\n\nOur beloved Guru Maharaj is ready to offer all respects to others and expects none for himself. He is a true Vaisnava who considers any respect offered to him as a hot potato and does not keep the same to himself. He passes on all the respects to Srila Prabhupada and previous acharyas and ultimately the same reaches to Lord Sri Krishna, Who being the absolute truth, can handle the same very easily.\n\nOnce someone asked the Guru Maharaj why he does not carry any deities with himself like other ISKCON sanyasis. Guru Maharaj replied very nicely, �The holy name is my deity�. Since Krishna�s name and His forms are non-different, Guru Maharaj carries the holy names of Lord Sri Krishna in his heart and chants the Lord�s names constantly wherever he goes. The Lord Sri Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita verse 9.14:\n\nsatata krtayanto m yatanta ca dha-vrat\nnamasyanta ca m bhakty nitya-yukt upsate\n\n�Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.� Our Guru Maharaj, a great soul, is a true personification of this verse of Bhagavad Gita. I offer my humble obeisances on the lotus feet of our beloved Guru Maharaj. JAI GURUDEV!"

The Necessity of Approaching Guru\n\nThe Bhgavatam says:\n\ntasmd guru prapadyeta\njij�su reya uttamam\n(SB 11.3.21)\n\n�One seeking the highest good must surrender to a bona fide guru.�\n\nCompelled by suffering, yet pulled by hope, I came to your lotus feet�not knowing what I needed, but knowing you held the key to everything worthwhile. By your instructions, �reya� began to awaken within me: a dormant longing for eternal service, a desire to love Krishna above all else.\n\nYour words cut the bonds of ignorance, just as the sun disperses morning fog.\n\n 3. The Power of Sadhu-Saga and the Guru�s Instructions\n\nLord Kapila teaches:\n\nsat prasagn mama vrya-savido\nbhavanti ht-kara-rasyan kath\n(SB 3.25.25)\n\nIn your association, your words enter not only my ears but my heart. Your hari-kath intoxicates the soul and awakens a longing for the path of devotion.\n\nBy hearing from you, faith becomes conviction; conviction becomes service; and service becomes love. Thus, as Kapiladeva concludes, raddh, rati, and bhakti naturally arise by serving the devotees.\n\n 4. Only by Guru�s Mercy Can One Approach the Lord\n\nPrahlda Mahrja states:\n\nnai matis tvad urukramghri\nspriaty anarthpagamo yad-artha\nmahyas pda-rajo�bhieka\nniki�cann na vta yvat\n(SB 7.5.32)\n\nWithout the dust of the great souls� feet, no one can approach the lotus feet of Krishna.\n\nIt is that dust�your dust�which has sanctified my life.\nTo be allowed to carry even a particle of your instruction is the wealth of lifetimes.\nBy bathing in that sacred dust, the stains of anarthas begin to fade, and the soul remembers its true identity.\n\n 5. Guru Opens the Door to Liberation\n\nabhadeva teaches:\n\nmahat-sev dvram hur vimukte\n(SB 5.5.2)\n\n�Service to great souls opens the door to liberation.�\n\nFor me, this means that serving you�your instructions, your mission, your devotees�is the only highway to freedom.\n\nYour compassion has opened a door not only to liberation but to something far greater: an invitation to serve in the loving domain of r r Rdh-Krishna.\n\n 6. The Guru as the One Who Awakens Taste for Bhakti\n\nThe Bhgavatam begins its instructions with the foundation of spiritual life:\n\nsyn mahat-sevay vipr\npuya-trtha-nievat\n(SB 1.2.16)\n\nBy serving great souls, one gains taste for Vsudeva-kath.\nIt is by your mercy that the holy name has become sweet, the scriptures alive, and service meaningful.\n\nWithout your guidance, I would still be entangled in the illusions of material identity, unaware of the treasure hidden within the heart.\n\n 7. My Humble Prayer\n\nrmad-Bhgavatam often glorifies the disciple's mood:\n\nyasya prasdd bhagavat-prasdo\nyasyprasdn na gati kuto�pi\n\n�By the mercy of the guru one gets the mercy of Krishna; without it, there is no advancement.�\n\nThis truth resounds in every step of my life.\nIf I have any hope, it is because of you.\nIf I have any strength, it is borrowed from you.\nIf I have any devotion, it is planted by you.\n\n 8. Conclusion � My Offering at Your Feet\n\nGurudeva, on this most auspicious day of your Vysa-pj, I offer:\n\nmy mind�though restless, I place it at your feet;\nmy words�imperfect, yet longing to glorify you;\nmy heart�impure, yet yearning for your shelter;\nmy life�may it be used wholly in your service.\nPlease bless me with:\n\nunwavering faith in your instructions,\nthe strength to follow your example,\nhumility in service,\nand the aspiration to become a servant of your servants.\nMay I forever remain a particle of dust at your lotus feet.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nseeking shelter,\nHarivallabha Dasa and Kumari Devi Dasi"

    "Your Offering": "Date: 14th Nov 2025, London, UK\nDear Gurudev,\nPlease accept my soul-felt obeisances at your lotus feet on this very special occasion.\nI am struggling very badly to comprehend how I could put down my gratitude and even more so your glory in few words!\nKrishna says in the 9th canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam: sdhavo hdaya mahya, sdhn hdaya tv aham, mad-anyat te na jnanti, nha tebhyo mang api.\nWhen I first read this verse during my regular study of the Bhagavatam, with closed eyes the personality that immediately became visible in my consciousness is your brilliantly shining form. You are that perfect Sadhu that I have met after millions of lifetimes in this material world. That you always keep Krishna in your heart constantly is an established fact, but now I know, and I understand fully, that Krishna knows no one else but you.\n\nAny thought of you, your lotus feet, is complete wholeness, and Krishna is fully present in that moment. I always wanted to please you, and for a very long time, this was the main motivation of my existence. But it was you who taught me in one of your Vrindavan yatra classes that the purpose of existence is not to please Guru but to please Guru by pleasing Krishna. Where can anyone in this entire creation find as genuine and authentic a Guru as your kind self!\n\nIn any assembly of Vaishnavas where you are present, envy is at once dispelled by your sadhutva. Enemies become friends, and bullies become sober! You extract the best in everyone, just like the great Mahajans in the Bhagavatam. Not just that, you transform people's hearts and existence. Please, someone explain to me what else is bigger magic How can I even start to glorify your good qualities Where can I start I feel complete lack. Yet, by meditating on your lotus feet, I gain strength. You never like your glorification, yet I embarrass you every time I get your darshan at the airport or when I get to speak to you even momentarily after your classes or on any other occasion. Please take this as my foolish, childish enthusiasm to share the reality of what I am experiencing. I have communicated to you at least on two occasions that you are a magical Gurudev, and every time I asked you a question in my meditation during my morning reading of Srimad-Bhagavatam, or discussed any other difficulty of life with you, you helped me even when you were a million miles away! How do I begin to explain the specifics I saw the embarrassment on your face when I glorified you like this last time at the airport, and while you didn�t dislike my honest statements, you communicated that there are more important things to do. Yet again, I dare to glorify you, knowing very well that you are more pleased not with your glorification but with the service of devotees, the movement, and cultivating Vaishnav behavior. I desire to be conditioned to the glorification of Radha Krishna, Prabhupada, and you, oh beloved Gurudev. And because I want to glorify you, I know I will end up glorifying all Sadhus with sadhutva. Please do not consider this as my offense. I seek your correction, protection, mercy, blessings, and empowerment.\nDear Gurudev, you have given us, your disciples, divine Chakshu to see everything in life as an opportunity to serve Krishna, to see every reversal not as punishment but as an opportunity to learn, a moment to intensify and go closer to Krishna. Instead of now complaining and cursing the situation or the person, I am now able to see inside, see the hand of the Lord in the reversals of my life and the people I deal with. I am able to see the bad things of my own heart.\n     Denial is gone, and Acceptance is the norm!\n      Correction is the focus, as Krishna�s pleasure is the only solace.\nWhere can one find such a compassionate spiritual master who can give eyes to the blind persons of Kaliyuga like myself to actually see!\n   kalau naa-dm ea, purrko �dhunodita.\nYou are the walking Bhagavatam and talking Bhagavatam too! Because whenever I lose the ability to see, you come as the guiding light of the sun in my dreams and sometimes in my awakened state of consciousness. You transcend the via medium to help and guide this conditioned soul.\n\nYou give us vision to see beyond! Eyes not just to see the situation but to see the person! And not just to see the persons but to see their hearts. And not just to see their hearts and situations but to see how Krishna is ordaining everything and helping everyone! And not just to see Krishna�s activities in people�s lives but to actually see His most beautiful form! And not just able to see His most beautiful form but to behold it constantly! Be able to be soaked in it. Be able to appreciate it constantly and be grateful. You gave us the entire whole!\n\nHow can someone not serve such a most compassionate and most magnanimous spiritual master who knows nothing but service of his own spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada, who rests not a moment and is willing to go through all pains for the service of his own spiritual master, who can ask Krishna everything for himself, yet chooses to pray to Jagannath for his disciples and put their well-being and progress first.\n\nSanjaya declares: yatra yogevara Krishna, yatra prtha dhanur-dhara, tatra rr vijayo bhtir, dhruv ntir matir mama. Wherever there is Krishna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality.\nI can with honesty say that wherever there is true remembrance of you, oh Gurudev, wherever there are Sadhus like you or desiring to follow you, there will be Vaishnav qualities, there will be Vaishnav behavior, Krishna will be fully pleased with devotees, and devotees will cooperate with each other, and the movement will stand strong, united, and flourishing. Following your teachings from classes and the guidance of people who follow you gives one the best chance they can get to please Srila Prabhupada and Krishna.\n\nWhen I first met you back in 2010 in Bhaktivedanta Manor, you were seated like a moon on the vyasasan, and like honeybees, devotees gathered around you to drink the honey of your mercy. At that time, I was taking your darshan for the very first time, and I had requested if I could touch your feet to take blessings. You troubled yourself to come slightly down from your aasan and had to take your socks off to allow me to touch your lotus feet. Almost 10 years later, in 2024, in one of your classes, I heard you had done the same when you first met Srila Prabhupada, and Prabhupada kindly allowed you to touch his lotus feet. This is parampara, I felt and feel empowered by it every time I think of your mercy.\n\nI want to glorify you endlessly, Gurudev. In fact, why would one who has the best of jewels shy away from adorning them\n\nIn our last meeting, when I thanked you from the bottom of my heart for everything and explained how I was so happy in my spiritual life, so happy reading Srimad-Bhagavatam, and so happy with devotee association, in spite of my many, many shortcomings, you became happy, and you touched your heart and pointed to my heart with your brilliant smile. What else can one aspire for in life than the shelter, pleasure, and service of such a most magnanimous and compassionate spiritual master! Yet, I struggle to serve your instructions properly due to my disease of forgetfulness. I seek your empowerment, mercy, and blessings.\nOn your 75th Birthday, Gurudev, I want to say that you are everything for me and for many other lives. You are the most special. You are a perfect follower of your Guru and one of the best jewels of our movement. By your blessings, may I always remember Radha Krishna, and never forget Radha Krishna, and may I always also remember you fondly, every moment and at my last breath, and follow your instructions and be the servant of the servant of your servants and servant of servant of servants of your Gurudev, His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada.\n\nMay you healthily and happily grace this earth for very long if Prabhupada so desires, and may you be pleased with me always.\n\nI beg your forgiveness for expressing my heart unfiltered, for anything that I may have said that may not have been appropriate or may have inadvertently hurt you.\n\nAlways desiring your love, mercy, guidance, shelter, blessings, and empowerment.\nAlways desiring to remember your lotus feet and instructions.\nAlways desiring to serve you.\n\nYour lowly servant,\nVamsi Dhari das"

    "Your Offering": ".\n\nDear Guru Maharaj\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances, all glories to Srila Prabhupada, all glories to you and your compassion!\n\nThank you for bringing us all together for this year�s Kartik Yatra in Govardhan.\n\nThe vrajavasis received the inconceivable opportunity to spend 7 days and 7 nights in the association of Krishna, and we received the inconceivable opportunity to spend 7 days in your association, hearing about the wonderful, enlivening, and purifying pastimes of Krishna, which are simultaneously playful and profound.\n\nI remember when you started your �Journey Home,� you experienced unsettling truths of the world as a boy and young man, despite being surrounded by loving parents who protected and loved you sincerely, the best way they knew how.\n\nYou reciprocated their love with much gratitude, yet you still decided to leave the comfort of your home in Chicago to go on a search for God and the purpose of life.\n\nAfter that message you received on the Island of Crete, �Go to India!�, you followed the call and came to the land of Vrindavan, on the auspicious day of Krishna Janmashtami. Here, you learned about, experienced, and appreciated the loving service attitude of the residents of Vrindavan towards Sri Sri Radha and Krishna, and others, and it captured your heart.\n\nAs hard as it was, you left Vrindavan and went back to your home in America, and now you are bringing so many people to Vrindavan to access and share that same fortune you received. This is especially by Srila Prabhupada�s grace, because the spiritual master, who is the representative of Balaram, reveals to a sincere disciple the glories of the dham.\n\nYour compassion shows your understanding of what truly pleases Srila Prabhupada and Gauranga Nityananda: to find joy in sharing Krishna with others.\n\nI was born in a Hindu family but didn�t have any attraction to Krishna or Vrindavan. Your enthusiasm and the way you can create the spirit of Vrindavan in the hearts of people and communities awakened this attraction within my heart 18 years ago, 2 weeks after I met some devotees and was invited to your Srimad Bhagavatam class at Soho temple, ISKCON-London.\n\nYou inspire us to engage in devotional service according to our nature and strengths given by Krishna, and your classes help us to grow a taste for the highest service of hearing and chanting about Krishna.\n\nYou pulled me out of my material life and gave me a chance to realize the true meaning of life. Though I am still on my journey to purifying my heart, by reading Srila Prabhupada�s books, hearing your classes, and most of all, applying what I read and hear in the present moment in the adventure of this beautiful gift of life to serve, I have experienced less fear and more love by being on the path of Bhakti. This is especially so this past year, which has deepened my faith in the process of Bhakti. Krishna is real! His devotees are so kind.\n\nSeeing your fearless example of your journey home and how you continue to serve others with a selfless, joyful, and grateful heart, I feel inspired to follow in your footsteps in my own little way for the pleasure of guru and Gauranga.\n\nPeople are so misguided by limitless distractions, incomplete, impersonal philosophies, and unfulfilling paths that lead us away from our true nature and eternal loving relationship with Sri Sri Radha and Krishna and each other, with our service to them in the center.\n\nThere is much suffering that people are experiencing in the world � through wars, unstable economic and political situations, and even within their own relationships, physical and mental health, and lack of purpose in their life.\n\nBhakti truly is a life beyond all this suffering and a path that offers hope and shelter even during difficult storms of life, like the storm Indra sent.\n\nI pray as I chant the holy names, attentively listen to your classes, read Srila Prabhupada�s books, appreciate and serve in the wonderful association of sincere devotees, that I can be empowered to pay it forward and connect others to this glorious path so they can go on their own journey home.\n\nI pray to engage in service that will please the Lord in sharing Krishna Consciousness with others, in whatever way I can.\n\nYou set an incredible example. I am deeply grateful, beyond these mere words, and my life is to reciprocate by serving to express my gratitude.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\n\nTulas Sundar devi ds"

He guided us to take up some of those services which can please you the most.\nThese are:\n\n1. We will be inviting devotees trained personally by you, who had your very close personal association, who you gave personal instructions to, and who are living their lives as per your guidance and instructions. We will hear from them about your intimate teachings which they want to reveal to us, so that we can appreciate and connect with your Holiness in deeper, loving gratitude and devotion.\n\n2. Each one of the families in our counselee group will be inviting, in a year, at least 6 families of devotees (1 family at a time) to their homes. We will be discussing Krishna Katha, Srila Prabhupada Katha, Sri Guru Katha, or any suitable spiritual topic. This will help us to develop relationships and solidify our bonds in the community as one family.\n\n3.

Every year we celebrate HDG Shrila Prabhupada�s Vyasa Puja since 2011 in our group with different themes.\n\nThis year, a theme of offerings was: \"Disciples of HDG Srila Prabhupada, their intimate spiritual service and relationship with him\".\n\nEach family presented the offering from the perspective of a particular disciple of HDG Srila Prabhupada. Devotees could immerse themselves in overwhelming divine emotions exhibited by each of the disciples� personal flavor of mood of devotion.

When we read The Journey Home, we were amazed at the fact of how you remembered every single event to its minute details. Your quality of observing and processing the events that unfolded in your life teaches us how you are present and absorbed in every moment.\n2. The instructions which you share through your nectarean lectures with your disciples and ever-growing Radhagopinath congregation are very inspiring. Every instruction of yours reflects the need to cultivate sincere gratitude towards our parampara and develop a humble service attitude towards our fellow godbrothers and godsisters. These instructions are helping both of us in our journey of practicing Krsna consciousness, reminding us at every step of the mood which you desire to cultivate.\n3. Your presence of mind and humor in dealings with others is quite amazing and inspiring. In one of the videos shared by HG Arjun Sakha Prabhu, he narrates that once an Indian chess player asked you, \"How did you get attracted to our Krsna\" And knowing his chess background, you replied, \"This white boy got checkmated by your black king of Vraja.\" Because he was a chess player, you gave a reply in chess language. This interaction highlighted your humorous nature and ability to come up with witty Krsna conscious answers on the spot.\nFinally, we thank you from the bottom of our heart for accepting us as your disciples and we request you to bless us that we may continue to serve in this mission of Srila Prabhupada till the last day of our life.\n\nYour humble servants,\nDharmaraj das and Sukumari Radhe Devi Dasi"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna\nDear Gurumaharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances unto your divine lotus feet \n\nI am not at all qualified to write about you, but for my purification, I will try to glorify you on this most auspicious occasion of your 75th appearance day (Diamond Jubilee) with my limited mind and words.\n\nDear GuruMaharaj, I have been seeing and hearing all oceanic Vaishnava qualities in you since the last two decades from so many of your disciples (my Godbrothers). And for so many days, we have been able to listen to your glorification from various devotees, as they have been sharing online from 75 days before your 75th birth anniversary. From all the devotees' sweet words and my personal experience, I can see you are the personification of all these qualities. Taking this golden opportunity, I would like to share a few drops of your qualities.\n\nTaking care of devotees - Through the counseling system which you have established in ISKCON all over the world, you provide very loving and affectionate care to all the devotees for their personal and all-around growth in ISKCON, especially to all your disciples. We could get your association through our counselor. So we do not feel a lack of your love. Thank you, Gurumaharaj, for giving us so many Shiksha gurus like HG Radheshyam Prabhu, HG Gaurang Prabhu, HG Radha Gopinath Prabhu, HG Shamanand Prabhu, HG Govind Prabhu, HG Braj Bihari Prabhu, HG Gaur Gopal Prabhu, HG Gaurang Darshan Prabhu, and so many Grihastha devotees like our counselor HG Mukund Anand Prabhu, who are all part of your counselor system and guiding us in all ways to remain happy in KC. As we are sheltered under their guidance, we always feel your blessings and mercy upon us.\n\nFor so many years, you have been caring for all of your Godbrothers. Even during and after this 2025 Kartik yatra, you met all your Godbrothers and different devotees in Vrindavan, spent time eagerly visiting them, and took care of them. In this yatra, replacing machines, you lovingly appreciated all matajis for making chapatis and, at the same time, gave them the big opportunity to serve all Vaishnavas. How wonderfully you took care of all 12,000 devotees, giving us your divine association, mercy, and love. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for such Kartik Dham yatras. Myself and my family attended this year's yatra online, but the amazing thing was that we felt in our hearts that we were in the pandal itself. The only missing part was your and all devotees' vapu association and various services. \n\n Your enlivening lectures - In every yatra, you describe almost the same pastimes of the Lord, but those are so much updated every year, and many things are new to learn from them. This year, you elaborately described the reunion of Krishna in Vrindavan after the Dwarka pastimes of the Lord, which we heard for the first time only. Your katha of pastimes are so intense, in-depth, and full of philosophical points that they really touch our hearts and increase our faith in KC. Your deep study of scriptures and commentaries of all acharyas gave us the essence of pure devotional service. Simultaneously, you set an exemplary role model for all of us through your dealings with all devotees as well as all living entities in yatras and everywhere. After every lecture, your mesmerizing Kirtans and prayers to the Lord are really blessing us, having a boosting effect on our hearts to go closer towards Krishna. All over ISKCON, you have set the highest standard of practicing KC culture. This really shows your deep absorption in Krishna and your distributing that love of Krishna to all of us, which shows us your magnanimity and compassion infused with full Gurutatva.\n\nGuruMaharaj, in all your lectures, you always explain about humility, sincerity, gratitude, and compassion, which are the topmost four qualities to perfect our life in Krishna Consciousness. We see you are the emblem or personification of these great Vaishnava qualities. You have great love and concern about Shrila Prabhupad, his instructions, and ISKCON's growth. So, you always give us the key to live happily in KC: \"to take care of each other and lovingly serve each other and ultimately serve Krishna.\" So, we surely try to follow this. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for all this.\n\nThis year, my beloved mother Shri Yashoda Devi Dasi departed from this world. Thank you, Maharaj, because, due to your causeless mercy and Lord Krishna's arrangement, she left her body completely hearing Kirtan of the holy name in the association of devotees. All this happened because you accepted her as your disciple and gave her initiation in 2014. She could live her life in the best Krishna Consciousness as your disciple. She always used to hear your translated lectures, and by seeing you speaking and serving Shrila Prabhupad in many ways, going to different countries, and traveling so far, she always got so much inspiration from you. We know that, because of her chronic illness, she couldn't do any other physical service, but she always used to read BG, SB, CC, Chaitanya Bhagvat, and Shrila Prabhupad Lilamrit (short) in Marathi repeatedly (she read all these scriptures 3-4 times). She would sing so many Vaishnav bhajans and regularly sang all Aratis. From the day of her initiation, she chanted 32 rounds every day until her last days. Inspite of her illness, she used to do all this only by seeing you, Maharaj. So, I realize that even if somebody just sees you, they can wholeheartedly render so much service in KC. And I am sure, because of your special mercy on her, she definitely went home back to Godhead. Gurumaharaj, for this mercy, I offer my respectful gratitude from the bottom of my heart \n\nLastly, I beg your mercy for uplifting me from my situation in this material life and my ignorant conditional state in this life. I am very much grateful to you, Maharaj, for accepting me and my wife Parijatlila as your insignificant servants in this KC movement of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to serve all the present Acharyas and Guru Parampara, and for giving us brahmin initiation last year in 2024 (even though I am not eligible for that).\n\nWithout my qualification, I sincerely pray to Lord Radha Vrindavan Chandra to bless you with a very, very healthy and long life \n\nGurumaharaj, on this auspicious day, please forgive all my offenses and bestow your causeless mercy upon me so that I can follow all your instructions carefully and sincerely, and try to preach KC all over and take care of my family in the best KC way, so that my both daughters, Gaurangi and Apurva, can also become instruments to serve in the mission to preach KC. I will be very fortunate if I can get a drop of any one quality from your all oceanic Vaishnava qualities. \n\nAll glories to Shri Guru and Gauranga \nAll glories to Shrila Prabhupad \nParam Pujya Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki Jai \n\n\"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna\nKrishna Krishna Hare Hare\nHare Rama Hare Rama\nRama Rama Hare Hare\"\n\nThank you very much \n\nYour Insignificant Servant,\nMudit Krishna das,\nParijat Lila Devi Dasi,\nGaurangi and Apurva.\nAnd my beloved mother Shri Yashoda Devi Dasi."

Through your lectures, personality, and life, you emphasized so much becoming a genuinely humble servant of the Lord by serving His dear devotees, and by that only we can achieve all perfection. I was and still am very much embarrassed with material sense gratification, even after coming into devotional service, but by your merciful teachings, I am trying to hear your vani as much as possible and by seeing your followers, how they are blissfully practicing your instructions and advancing in their spiritual life. Your vani and followers of your Vani are saving me from getting burned in the forest fire of my anarthas. By showering the rain of your selfless love and compassion, which we can feel, you are extinguishing the fire. Therefore, I offer my most respectful obeisances unto your Lotus feet.\n\nYou have so much taste for kirtan, following the footsteps of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. One devotee friend was sharing with me that if one wants to experience the dancing LCM, one should see your dance. I am not very much qualified to witness all your pastimes physically, but by participating in your Annual Kartik Yatra, which is so dear to you, which is your very expression of compassion and your gratitude to Srila Prabhupada (as mentioned by your divine self), we are getting a fortunate entry into the ocean of your bliss. It is as if we are in the Spiritual World. The way you make all your dear sons and daughters chant together with a full heart, not letting us hold anything back, to cry out for the mercy of the Lord, is simply very fulfilling to our hearts. And you make us dance there in your ecstatic kirtan for the pleasure of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. I simply offer my most humble obeisances unto your divine Lotus feet.\n\nYou have so much taste for serving the Deities. I was amazed to come to know that your divine self has very blissfully served the deities with so much love and sacrifice for about 8 years in such an austere condition in New Vrindavan. And you taught us that Deities will be most pleased if we are serving and pleasing His devotees with humility and love. And you have created so many engagements to make sure all your disciples are blissfully engaged in serving the Lord through preaching, temple building, cleaning, cooking, assisting. And you like so much to see the Deities getting served nicely. Once you saw that all Tulsi Maharanis were not in good health due to improper care, and you decided to fast until you see the Tulsi Maharani is responsibly getting served by your dear disciples. I offer my humble obeisances unto your Lotus feet, so that I can assist those who are assisting you in pleasing the Lord.\n\nYou love to feed the Lord with all various kinds of foodstuffs. And you are glad to see your devotees cooking, serving, assisting, and honoring prasadam, that I could witness in the Annual Kartik Yatra. There are so many items, different types of sweets every day, all made not just to feed devotees but to please and satisfy the devotees. And how nicely you have empowered your disciples with your humble service attitude that is visible in the Yatra, where every devotee is just wanting to serve everyone, in whatever possible way, sacrificing his/her own comforts. Many rolling chapatis the whole day, many washing plates of devotees, and it is countless. We are so much blessed to learn from you the secret of true happiness in selflessly serving and pleasing the Vaishnavas. I offer my humble obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\n\nYou always find the opportunity to chant and glorify the names, forms, qualities, and pastimes of the Lord. So many times, you have mentioned that with your dear Godbrothers, like HH Bhakti Tirth Swami Maharaj, HH Tamal Krishna Goswami Maharaj, and others, you have cherished their association by discussing hours of Krishna-kath, sometimes all night. You always keep chanting the names of the Lord. You are like an active soldier of Lord Chaitanya, who relishes to be on the field, preaching the glories of the Lord. You churn out newer and newer ways to reach the fallen souls like us and somehow give them the mercy of Srila Prabhupada. I offer my most humble obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\n\nYou are expert in assisting the Servants of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath in Their conjugal pastimes. You have manifested the Vrindavan, not to replace the original Vrindavan but to deepen our feeling and meditation on the real spirit of Vrindavan, following in the footsteps of our previous Acaryas in manifesting their Gupta Vrindavan. Srila Prabhupada once said that assisting the Gopis in serving the conjugal pastimes of Sri Sri Radha Krishna is non-different from distributing his books to everyone. And you showed last year how you have assisted and honored Srila Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj by distributing 6.5 lac+ books through your servants in a way never done before. I offer my humble obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\n\nYour personality and lectures are very much in line with your Spiritual Master, and because you are always meditating on the personality of Srila Prabhupada, we can factually feel his presence in your personality. All the scriptures and saintly persons have confirmed to see the Lord in the personality of one's Guru, who is the via transparent medium of the whole parampara. And because you are so dear to Krishna, you are His very confidential representative. I offer my humble obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\n\nIf we get your mercy, we are sure to get Krishna's mercy. But without your mercy, there is no chance of getting Krishna's mercy. In one of your lectures (2009, Kolkata), you have expressed the desire to develop Kolkata, the birthplace of Srila Prabhupada. And many of your dear servants are putting their life and soul to fulfill your desire to glorify Srila Prabhupada. I am very much unqualified; that's why Krishna put me so far from Kolkata, so that I can become more sincere and serious in bhakti. I am begging you for your mercy and all necessary qualifications so that I can get the opportunity to serve in the proper mood in whatever insignificant way. May I develop a drop of those qualities of humility and tolerance that you expect from your every student. I wish to remember you always, begging at your Lotus Feet to be able to serve in a way that pleases you and so Krishna. I offer my most humble obeisances unto your Lotus Feet.\n\nSeeking for genuine humility and devotion,\nTrying to realize my glorious insignificant position,\nYour servant's servant.\nNaveen Kumar."

I am very grateful to the wonderful **counseling** system and **for** growing such a community where we are feeling **sheltered**.\n\nFirst time I have visited GEV this year and I can see how much you cherish Vrindavan. I ask some attachment to Vrindavan from you like the way you have it. By your mercy we got a chance to stay under Govardan hill; it was really like a dream of being in Goloka and experiencing Govardhan lila during the yatra this year.\n\nSome of the points that touched my heart from your class in yatra this year are:\n\n1. All the animals danced, giving up their past conditioning and cooperated. Not only that, but they went to the extreme of a tiger kissing a deer. Similarly, in **sankirtan**, we all should cooperate with each other. What are those **petty** small conditions in front of the power of **sankirtan**\n\n2. One pure chanting of Hare Krishna mantra is enough and is the same as the 9 processes of **devotional** service.\n\n3. Indra thought the people of Vrindavan were very proud, but the world is a reflection of our own mind, and Indra was proud himself. We should not find fault in others.\n\n4. Sanatan Goswami took service from Srimati Radharani, and devotees may have emotional, physical needs. We should not tell them to be transcendental like the Goswamis, but we love Krishna. Krishna loves everyone, everyone is Krishna's children, so we should love everyone.\n\n5. Krishna is more pleased when we serve devotees than directly serving Him.\n\n6. Be kind to everyone and, in a small or big way, share this love of Krishna consciousness to others. Take **shelter** of the holy name.\n\nI personally felt, Maharaj, like a father sending his children on a difficult work for a long time with so much love and care. I felt you sent us back from the yatra with those loving words. It was very difficult to be separated from that experience. I felt very safe being with you.\n\nI hope I continue to follow your instruction to take **shelter** of the holy name and be kind and share this with others in whatever way I can. By doing this, I feel I am always with you.\n\nThank you very, very much for everything, my Dear Guru Maharaj."

These are the beacon light for us which show us the way and also give us the inspiration to walk on the right path of pure devotional service. Your words give us the vision to see the world and act for the pleasure of Guru and Krishna. Also they give us so much hope and nourishment to go ahead in our spiritual journey although there may be so many obstacles in the path. So thank you for your association through your divine sound vibration.\n-Gurudev, you are an ocean of Vaishnava qualities such as humility, simplicity, gratitude, being so dedicated to the mission of Srila Prabhupada and so on. Not only you mention and glorify these qualities in the great devotees of the Lord but you live by and exemplify them through your own life. For example: we hear so many times in your classes about the verse �Trinadapi sunicena tarorapi sahisnuna�.� And to me it appears so difficult, but when I see your exemplary life through the incidents mentioned in the book �The Journey Home� it becomes so clear what these qualities are.\n-Gurudev, your life helps us to understand what it means to be a seeker of the Lord and what it means to be a devotee. So thank you for the valuable association you are giving to us through your vapu and vani. It is because of your prayers that we are able to perform some little devotional service although struggling to come up to the standard.\nOn this auspicious day I want to beg you, Please:\n1) Gurudev, give to this servant just one drop of mercy. I am lower than a blade of grass. Give me all help. Give me strength. Let me be as you are, without desires and aspirations.\n2) I offer you all respects, for thus I may have the energy to know you correctly. Then by chanting the holy name in great ecstasy, all my offenses will cease.\n3) When will such mercy fall on this one who is weak and devoid of intelligence Allow me to be with you.\n4) If you examine me, you will find no qualities. Your mercy is all that I am made of. If you are not merciful unto me, I can only weep and I will not be able to maintain my life.\nThank you very much.\nYour aspiring servant,\nShyam Jagannath das"

Through your vani, we are understanding spiritual subject matter properly.\n\nWe are always attached to material sense gratification, but through your vani, you cut down our attachments. An Acharya is one who teaches through example, and by your example, we have learned to be grateful and humble in every situation.\n\nI heard one incident from your life from HG Vrindavan Prabhuji when you were going to give a lecture at one place. There, all the shoes and chappals were scattered here and there, and you gave your beadbag to HG Vrindavan Prabhuji. He entered the hall, but you didn't. A long time passed, so Prabhuji came to see what you were doing. You were arranging all the shoes and chappals with your hands nicely so that you wouldn't cross them by putting your legs.\n\nIn that same lecture, HG Vrindavan Prabhuji asked why you did that. You then told another story: once, a Mataji saw you sitting in excitement and threw her sandals/shoes here and there to come to you. You noticed that and in a very grave voice, you spoke, \"Why did you do that\" That Mataji didn't understand, then you further spoke, \"Can you imagine your life without chappals So much service they offer to you.\" So, you even see the service offered by non-living things, as in the spiritual world, everything is cetan, everything has life.\n\nAfter hearing this incident, I was amazed.\n\nYou often quote the verse of Sikshtakam in your lectures, \"trinad api sunichena....\" Without following this verse, one cannot chant the holy name properly and constantly, and you, through your life, teach us how to live this verse practically.\n\nI am remembering one incident which shows your quality of tolerance, which I heard in the lecture of HG Vrindavan Prabhuji. Once, a devotee offered you a garland which had ants in it, and you were singing Jai Radha Madhav. Even though red ants bit you, you were still so absorbed in singing Jai Radha Madhav that you didn't notice.\n\nWhile I am writing, I am remembering so many things, but I need to stop.\n\nThere are so many incidents and stories of yours through which you teach us all the 26 qualities of a true devotee.\n\nOh Gurudev, please, please accept this ignorant fool, attached to materialistic sense gratification, as your insignificant servant. I don't have any qualifications to even write this offering for you. What is my qualification to speak or write about great souls But just for my own purification, I have made this attempt to write this offering.\n\nYour insignificant aspiring servant and beggar of your mercy,\nAbhishek"

In the beginning, I used to get nourishment by hearing your audio-recorded lectures and then would get the opportunity to come to Chowpatty temple for your classes whenever possible. For two years, I got the opportunity to attend Pune yatra where you answered my questions in the question-and-answer sessions. Then, from 2010 onwards, I was blessed to attend the Kartik yatra whenever it was held.\nYour vaani has been the constant guiding compass in my Krishna consciousness, and I try to hear you regularly as far as possible. Through your lectures, you have been personally guiding me in my Bhakti, and many times you speak to answer the doubts I have or guide me through the anarthas and difficulties I am facing, lifting my consciousness and rectifying my attitude. Also, through the yatra and pastimes lectures, you take us to those holy places and give us entrance into that lila, and then take us out by giving us the wisdom to apply in our daily practical life.\nAs it is said in Hindi, �Jal hi jeevan hai,� similarly, �Aapki Vaani hi mere jeevan ka paani hai.� Without hearing your lectures, Bhakti becomes dry for me.\nAs food nourishes the body, similarly, your words are the food for thought and contemplation, to digest, apply, and get nourished and strengthened in Bhakti.\n\nBecause you carry Vrindavan in your heart,\nBecause you have deep, genuine devotion,\nBecause you live by the principles of Shikshastakam verses,\nBecause you are endowed with all the 26 qualities of Vaishnavas,\nBecause you personify deep gratitude,\nBecause you have genuine, deep concern for others and your heart is filled with compassion,\nBecause you genuinely cry out the holy names in your japa, kirtans, and bhajans,\nBecause you fervently pray to Lord and Guru Parampara,\nBecause you are serious, sincere, and without ulterior motives, and desire only the pleasure of Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas,\nBecause you are a genuine Prabhupada-anuga,\nBecause of your strong sadhana,\nBecause of your loving Vaishnav dealings and relationships,\nBecause of your maturity, realization, broad-mindedness, and ability to connect and touch the hearts of all classes of people and devotees,\nBecause of your deep classes, katha, and talks,\nBecause of your many, many wonderful qualities, interactions, and exemplary behavior, etc.\nYou have checkmated me, you have stolen my heart, and given me an ideal to strive for in my life. You are the role model, the hero of my life.\nOtherwise, I was lost in material life.\nYou have picked me up from the ocean of samsara and given me the opportunity to enter into the divine pastimes of Radha Gopinath and Pancha-Tattva.\nI beg you, Guru Maharaj, to bless me so that I can live by your expectations, be an exemplary devotee, a disciple you can be proud of.\nI beg you, Guru Maharaj, to bless me that I can live by the verse trinad api sunicena taror iva sahishnuna�.\nAnd also by the verse na dhanam, na janam, na sundarim, kavitam va�..\nAnd also by all other verses of Shikshastakam.\n\nPlease forgive me, Gurudev, for my hypocrisy, countless mistakes, offenses, laziness, lack of surrender, and gratitude.\nDespite all my faults and shortcomings, please be merciful to me to uplift me and accept me as your insignificant servant of servant and use me as an instrument and make me dance as you want me to dance.\nPlease give me the strength to follow your teachings and be a loyal follower of Srila Prabhupada and Guru Parampara.\n\nYour insignificant servant of servant\nBhakti Vaibhav Das\nISKCON Pune NVCC"

All glories to our most beloved Srila Prabhupada!\n\nNot a day goes by that I do not think of you or dream of you. I was still fortunate enough to meet you in person this year in Villa Vrindavana. Oh, what a joy it is to be in your *vapuh* association and the association of all my god-brothers and sisters. The heart jumps in joy to be able to sit directly at your feet and listen to your exposition of Krishna *katha*. It�s an extra perk and privilege in my life to see you in person. I have also just finished watching your Govardhana Kartik Yatra. I felt so deeply in your presence, as if I was one of those 12 thousand devotees there. Often when you spoke, tears would come to my eyes to see the magnitude of your preaching and the impact it has on us all. And here we are trying to canvas you to come to visit us in Radhadesh with only 120 devotees. Are we out of line, I wonder\n\nEven though your *vapuh* association is so precious to me, I don't feel separated from you, as I carry you in my heart throughout the day. We have recently finished studying the 3rd Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam in our Bhakti-vaibhava study group here in Radhadesh. There, in the verse 3.25.21, Kapila Muni explains the characteristics of a *sadhu* to his mother Devahuti. The line *suhda sarva-dehinm* caught my attention, and I went on a small journey of discovery, diving deep into this topic, which I then developed into a small presentation for my fellow study-buddies. I learned that there are different levels of friendships, and they are represented by different Sanskrit terms: from *bandhu*, *mitra/sakha*, *priya-sakha*, all the way to *suht*. *Suht* is one in a million, a friend who never lets you down, who loves you unconditionally, who is there with you no matter what, who always makes time for you, and who never judges you. He walks with you till you reach your goal. This friendship is so deep that many times words do not need to be expressed for the other to understand. It�s such a rare bond, which is hard to achieve, and not every person may be fortunate to get a friend of this level throughout their life. *Suht* is your best well-wisher. The conclusion of this presentation was that I feel extremely fortunate. Meeting devotees has opened the door for me to finally meet my *suhrts*. To meet Krishna as my *suhrt*, to get Srila Prabhupada as a *suhrt*, having you as my unique *suhrt*, and to have my husband, Visnu Murti, as my *suhrt*. These are four principal persons in my life who want to see me succeed on this journey of life and death.\n\nThis deeper study of just this one line of Srimad-Bhagavatam has been very revealing for me; it left a profound impression on my heart, and it certainly brought a deeper understanding of who a *sadhu* is, and how Srila Prabhupada has pushed himself into our lives to take us out of this world of *kunta*. This is who a *sadhu* is: the best well-wishing friend of all. You are this *suhrt* to me, Guru Maharaj. So close to my heart that I don't feel separated from you.\n\nI bow down to you with utter gratitude and pray for the qualities and abilities for being able to assist you and serve you in your service to Srila Prabhupada�s mission, that you can be proud of.\n\nYour aspiring servant\nLaksmipriya dd"

During that time, I briefly got the opportunity to mention how, through Your lectures, you have had a tremendous impact on myself as well as our Amritsar congregation on how to create, lead, and maintain an ideal spiritual balance in family life and relationships.

Previously, when I was very new to ISKCON�which I still consider myself to be�I wouldn�t fully believe this. However, the day I heard about you for the very first time, through H.G. Amogh Lila Prabhu, I have believed the same.\n\nThe very first time I saw you was on September 29, 2024, in Surat, Gujarat. It has always been my habit whenever a sannyasi comes to our temple, I would ask myself if he could be my Guru Maharaj. That day, when I first saw you, I asked myself the same question, and my heart did not immediately respond.\n\nHowever, December 7, 2024, became a special day. Unaware that it was the Vyasa Puja of my Guru Maharaj, I was casually listening to the glorification of a Prabhupada disciple. I heard a lecture from H.G. Amogh Lila Prabhu in which he was glorifying Guru Maharaj. That day will always remain special to me, especially hearing about your struggles to reach India.\nYou are like a huge ocean, and I am a drop of water coming from far away just to mix with you. Just like the ocean, you have qualities I cannot describe in a single day. Your humbleness towards everyone keeps me motivated in my daily sadhana. Your watery eyes (just like Prabhupada's) show compassion towards everyone, and your welcoming smile makes the devotees' hearts melt. The way you join your hands and greet every single devotee will always be in my core memory, and the way you sit so steadily, just like what Prabhupada said in his lectures about sitting straight, is truly inspiring.\n\nI have accepted you as my father, mother, my Guru, and my master, and I am your insignificant servant. Whenever I see you, I wish I could touch your lotus feet, and I cry my heart out, knowing only you would listen.\nI am learning to be compassionate and humble from you.\nSometimes I feel that you have descended to this material world just to free me from its grip and take me back with you, Srila Prabhupada, and Krishna.\n\nOn the day of your Vyasa Puja, I have nothing material to offer you. I can only promise that I will always be loyal to ISKCON and our beloved Prabhupada. I am eagerly waiting for the day when you will give diksha to me and bestow upon me my new name. Guru Maharaj, I am very far away from you, but please bless me so that I can see you in my heart every minute, every second. I am eagerly looking forward to your upcoming Vyas Puja so I can have your darshan again. I have a wish to meet you personally, but most importantly, I want to hear your lectures very carefully and accept every word as it is in my life.\n\nHappy 75th Vyasa Puja, Guru Maharaj.\nI will miss you every day until December 7, 2025.\n\nYour Servant,\nKomal"

Speaking of rla Rdhntha Swm Mahrja, he explained how such an exalted speaker�learned, realized, empowered�does not need to prepare for any class, yet still dedicates hours to research, references, notes, and insights from our cryas.\n\nWhen asked why, Mahrja replied:\n�There are so many people who come to listen to Krishna-kath. This is a very precious time of their life. It is my responsibility to ensure they receive the best possible benefit. They could spend this time elsewhere, yet they choose to hear Krishna-kath.�\n\nThis profound sense of responsibility�rooted deeply in humility�is exactly what we witness in you, Guru Mahrja.\n\nI vividly remember your powerful class on Balarma Prim, when you said with complete honesty:\n�I have not prepared to give this class.�\nSuch transparent humility can arise only from one who is truly sincere. Although honored, respected, and spiritually empowered, you never use these gifts for self-glorification. You use everything solely in the service of Guru, Gaurga, and the Vaiavas.\n\nLast year, during a Vysa Pj offering, rla Bhakti Vij�na Goswm Mahrja shared the beautiful analogy of the vatsa, the small calf.\n\nA mother cow�s love is spontaneous, overflowing, unconditional.\nHer milk flows joyfully simply because her calf needs nourishment.\n\nSimilarly, a genuine Guru showers his disciples with unending, selfless love�vtsalya-rasa�constantly desiring their spiritual upliftment, protection, and eternal welfare.\n\nIn return, the disciple must develop the same pure, simple dependence that the calf has for its mother�\nfollowing naturally, trusting completely,\nreceiving guidance with gratitude and surrender.\n\nBut there is also a solemn warning in this analogy:\nWhen the calf grows horns and begins to poke the mother�s udder, she understands that the calf no longer needs her milk. Naturally, the flow becomes less.\n\nLikewise, when a disciple begins to think�\n�I know more than my Guru Mahrja��\n�I no longer need his mercy��\n�I can advance on my own��\n\n�then the flow of blessings and mercy becomes thinner.\n\nGurudeva, on this sacred day, we pray sincerely that\nwe may never grow such horns.\nMay we remain forever as humble, grateful calves�\nfully dependent on your love, protection, and guidance.\n\nMay we always honor your humility, your dedication, your sincerity, and your unwavering commitment to the mission of rla Prabhupda.\n\nOur Collective Prayer\n\n  \n \n \n\n\ntvay h vaya nitya\ntvadya sevaka mana\ntvad-j�y sthita citta\ntvat-padbjeu lnatm\n\nMay we always delight in serving you.\nMay our minds remain your servants forever.\nMay our hearts stay fixed in your instructions.\nMay our lives remain surrendered at your lotus feet.\n\nThank you, Gurudeva.\nHare Krishna.\n\nYour servant and disciple,\nPrayag Rj Ds"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nrla Prabhupda once wrote in a letter to his disciple:\n\n�A devotee means he is able to tolerate all kinds of discomfort and whims of material nature, and because he is so much absorbed in serving Krishna, he has no time to become angry or take offense with others or find fault�no. A devotee means very liberal and kind to everyone, always a gentleman under all kinds of conditions of life.�\n\nIn my humble opinion, you embody this instruction of rla Prabhupda in the most complete and natural way. You travel the world and meet people from so many backgrounds and cultures. Within ISKCON, you are connected�directly or indirectly�to countless projects, services, devotees, and responsibilities. You listen to an endless variety of concerns, challenges, and problems, both serious and simple. Yet, despite all this engagement with people, management, and constant travel, you remain a humble servant of your spiritual master�always enthusiastic to give Krishna, to speak about Krishna, and to elevate the consciousness of every soul according to their capacity.\n\nAs I myself grow older, I increasingly recognize my own shortcomings. I realize how difficult it truly is to deal with people's emotions in a way that does not discourage them. To represent the truth�both relative and Absolute�and yet express it in an uplifting manner that inspires devotees and the general public to come closer to Krishna is not a simple task. But you do this constantly. You communicate with sensitivity, always adjusting your message to the time, place, circumstance, and audience.\n\nIn this world�material, spiritual, and even within religious institutions�there are so many opinions, divisions, and differences. People naturally take sides, and discord often follows. To navigate this landscape of egos requires deep humility, compassion, and surrender to a higher principle. You exemplify all of these qualities. You truly represent the essence of what rla Prabhupda came to teach the world.\n\nTherefore, on this most auspicious day of your divine appearance, I place a humble request before you: please bless me so that I may become even a small representative of your mood, just as you are a pure representative of your spiritual master.\n\nI am impulsive, impatient, and easily agitated�qualities arising from the mode of passion. If I truly wish to �talk the talk� and �walk the walk� from a spiritual perspective, I must cultivate the divine qualities that you so naturally live by.\n\nMy dear Guru Mahrja, you tirelessly push forward the movement of His Divine Grace. I humbly beg for your blessings on this auspicious day so that I may become your humble instrument of will.\n\nThank you for the kindness you have shown to me in the past, the kindness you show now, and the kindness you will show in the future.\n\nHare Krishna!\nYour servant always,\nAnanda Jagannath das\nDes Moines, Iowa"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Maharaj.\nPlease accept my most humble obeisances at your transcendental, merciful lotus feet on this most auspicious occasion of your divine and glorious Vyasa Puja. I also offer my most respectful humble obeisances at the dust of your exalted parents� lotus feet for giving us this matchless gift of your divine personality.\n\nThe spiritual master comes to this material world to deliver the conditioned souls and help them on their journey back home, back to the spiritual world. Maharaj, from the very early days of your life, you exhibited the qualities of a very, very exalted, liberated soul. When you were very young, I think your father had bought a new car, and you didn�t think yourself qualified to sit on the seat, so you sat on the floor of the car. I can�t even imagine such humility in a child so young. That just goes to show how elevated and how renounced your consciousness already was. And as you grew, you progressively showed so many other qualities of a resident of the spiritual world.\n\nI offer my heartfelt thanks to His Holiness Bhakti Tirtha Swami Maharaj for lovingly asking you to write about your spiritual journey, because through your book *The Journey Home*, we get a glimpse into your wonderful characteristics. I liked the book so much that I couldn�t put it down.\n\nThere are so many devotees from all over the world who want to glorify you. I would like to say that one of the highlights of my life was when I met you at one of the kirtan programs that you held. My mother had come to India at that time, so she also came to the program with me, and my Guru Maharaj introduced her to you. That was a very historic moment for both of us, my mother and me.\n\nWhile I was serving in Bombay, whenever my Guru Maharaj returned from traveling, and if you were also in India, there would be some big sankirtan program somewhere, or one at Chowpatty Temple. You also held many programs in Pune where I learned so much. You gave us a real taste for hearing, chanting, and kirtan. Of course, I couldn�t keep up with everybody there, but I learned that this is what real kirtan is meant to be.\n\nMaharaj, I feel that you are a real sadhu. When I stand in front of you, I know you can see right through my contaminated, dirty heart. I feel very unqualified to be in your presence, but I also feel that your presence is necessary to purify my heart, because by associating with you:\n\nsdhu-saga�, sdhu-saga� � sarva-stre kaya\nlava-mtra sdhu-sage sarva-siddhi haya\n\nI am very grateful for your association over the years, and for the association of your disciples, who are also exemplary and very kind. I remember when I first came to India, I was the only disciple of my Guru Maharaj here. Then one or two disciples came�Kunti Devi, then Vishakhapriya. Later Siddhi Lalasa also came, but that was further down the line.\n\nYour disciples used to be so kind to us, because we didn�t know how things worked in India. It was difficult for us to have a Vyasa Puja for my Guru Maharaj, but your disciples agreed to have a small program. Lalita Sakhi had a quite big boat, and it was decided that your senior disciples and a few disciples of my Guru Maharaj would have a small program on the boat consisting of kirtans, bhajans, katha, and then, of course, prasada.\nDuring prasada, My Guru Maharaj was speaking to one of your disciples, and when you were going past me and you stopped where I was sitting, near the end of the boat, and you bent down a little so that I could hear you. You said, �Nama Chintamani, don�t jump off the boat.�\nI was so shocked and surprised to hear that, because at that time I was having difficulty adapting to India, and there were many challenges. I was feeling very overwhelmed. When you said, �Don�t jump off the boat,� I understood you meant, �Don�t jump off the boat of ISKCON.� So I asked you, �Maharaj, what did you say� And you looked at me very gravely and said, �I think you heard.� You gave one of those very deep, transcendental glances and walked past. And that was the end of my peace of mind! I couldn�t eat or concentrate on anything. Those words were just reverberating in my mind: �Don�t jump off the boat.� I added in my mind, �of ISKCON.� That instruction helped me so much. It made me think about what was actually happening and realize that my problems were not so great that I needed to jump off the boat of Lord Caitanya�s movement.\n\nWhen you came to stay with my Guru Maharaj at Carpentaria, and it was Tamal Krishna Maharaj�s disappearance day celebration, which we celebrated at Kandarpa Manjari�s and Krishna Kirtan Prabhu�s home, about an hour�s drive from where we stayed. I think HH Niranjan Swami Maharaj was also there. I�m not sure if, at this program, Mother Yamuna and Mother Dinatarini also came, because they were living just down the road from Kandarpa Manjari�s.\n\nWhen it was my time to speak, I mentioned the incident where I had cooked for Tamal Krishna Goswami Maharaj and the devotees going on parikram � my Guru Maharaj�s disciples and Tamal Krishna Maharaj�s disciples during the VIHE. On Saturday, it was our day when we went on parikram. I felt that I should do some service, so I tried to make a preparation. I could see that there were too many devotees and I wouldn�t be able to manage, but I still tried, and it wasn�t such a success. I had made poha, but there was no chutney with it. And, in India, everybody knows that some preparations have to have chutney or some wet accompaniment with them.\n\nTamal Krishna Maharaj asked, �Who cooked� because there was no chutney. He commented, �Giriraj Maharaj should beat his women disciples � and especially Nama Chintamani. He shouldn�t let her put a foot in the kitchen.� Everybody was laughing, and my Guru Maharaj leaned over to Niranjan Swami Maharaj and you and said, �I wish I knew this earlier.� And there was more laughter.\n\nLater, another time I glorified Kunti Devi for how selflessly she served my Guru Maharaj. And on the way home, you told me that you liked my offering the best. I felt so enlivened by that. Because honestly, I didn�t think it was anything special. Yet your encouragement meant so much.\n\nI also remember that sometimes I don�t follow proper protocol. When my Guru Maharaj became very ill and had to have a bypass surgery, I was so hysterical and disturbed that I phoned the Chowpatty temple and asked to speak to you. By Krishna�s arrangement, you happened to be near the phone. I think you even picked it up. You were so calm. You said, �Don�t worry, we are all praying.� All the godbrothers were praying. Your assurance gave me so much relief, and by the mercy of the Vaishnavas my Guru Maharaj recovered.\n\nMaharaj, I want to say so much about your preaching and how you are such an exemplary devotee. You are always thinking about how to expand Srila Prabhupada�s mission and how to cultivate Vaishnava qualities in your disciples. By your example, we learn these qualities ourselves. Once HH Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaj mentioned that when he visited somewhere in South India, the devotees were so humble and wonderful. He said, �They remind me of someone, but I can�t think who.� He asked one of them, �Who is your spiritual master� The brahmachari said, �His Holiness Radhanath Swami.� Maharaj said, �Oh! How could I not have guessed�\n\nYour projects�GEV, the Bhakti Center in New York, and so many others�are all such incredible contributions. There are so many efforts you make that we don�t even know about, all to secure the future of Srila Prabhupada�s movement so that for the next 10,000 years, the preaching will continue to expand. Even at the cost of your health, you are ready to do anything and everything for Srila Prabhupada.\n\nI must also mention this�otherwise this offering cannot be complete. When I was in Carpinteria and you visited, I had just had a hip replacement surgery. I was moving around with a walker. After lunch one day, you saw me and asked how I was doing. You know my heart, and you knew how anxiety-stricken I was about being able to walk again. I was thinking, �How will I serve if I cannot walk� You told me, �Don�t worry. My father had two knee replacements and He said, �Now I can do any damn thing I want.�� Meaning I would also recover fully. I had dreams about walking again, going up the stairs, and your words helped remove my anxiety. You encouraged me so much.\n\nI miss your personal association. Even one or two minutes with you gives me so much strength and happiness. You have been in India, and I have also been here since the end of 2023. In January 2024 I had a procedure on my spine, and now I live right opposite Bhaktivedanta Hospital. You have visited this place many times, but because of my condition, I have not been able to meet you personally. Still, I know that you know everything that is going on, and that your blessings are always with me. I thank you very much once again for your ongoing support, encouragement, and kindness.\n\nAnd I also dream of you sometimes.\n\nMaharaj, I thank you so much for all the wonderful association I have had with you and my Guru Maharaj. It is one of the most inspiring things in my life. Please bless us that we can develop even one drop of your amazing qualities. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for being part of my life.\n\nHare Krishna Maharaj.\nHis Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki Jai.\nHis Holiness Giriraj Swami Maharaj ki Jai.\nSrila Prabhupada ki Jai.\n\nEternally indebted and grateful to you\nYour Insignificant servant\nNama Chintamani Devi Dasi (GRS)"

But I pray that one day � by the causeless mercy of Sri Radha Rani, Sri Krishna, and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu � I may become worthy of having your darshan, serving you even in a small way, and being in the association of your beloved devotees.\nUntil that day comes, I pray that I may always remember your instructions, your example, and your compassion. Please bless me with the strength to follow the path of bhakti sincerely, without selfishness, pride, or laziness. Please allow me to serve you and Srila Prabhupada in whatever small ways I can.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for coming into my life, for giving me hope, and for teaching me the meaning of devotion through your own life of selfless service.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nPawan Kumar"

With your boundless compassion, you have accepted me as your daughter. Your teachings on compassion and love for all living beings have inspired and guided me in many ways. You have shown us how to serve with humility, care for others selflessly, and see Krishna�s presence in every soul. I pray at your lotus feet to give me strength to imbibe these qualities and aspire to dedicate my life to please you and the devotees.\n\nA couple of pastimes that have truly inspired me.\n\nThe first pastime is from The Journey Home when Radhanath Swami Maharaj speaks about a spiritual master. When he visited Rishikesh and meditated on the banks of the Ganges, sitting on a rock that was 20 feet above the water, he observed many objects being swept along in the current of Mother Ganges�leaves, flowers, uprooted trees, a dead buffalo, and even human corpses. The flow of the Ganges carried them to the banks. Maharaj explained that the spiritual path and spiritual teacher are like the current of Mother Ganges, and the disciples are like the objects carried along by the river. If we remain faithful to the current of the holy teachings, we will be carried to the ocean of spiritual truth. Radhanath Swami Maharaj exemplifies this quality throughout his life by remaining faithful and dedicating himself completely to Srila Prabhupada, spreading the message of Krishna consciousness to the entire world.\n\nThe other pastime I would like to share highlights His compassion towards other living entities. Once, while traveling in Mumbai, Radhanath Swami Maharaj�s car stopped at a traffic signal. Some beggars approached and knocked on the window, asking for food. Maharaj gently asked the person with him, �Do you have any rice puffs or pancakes to give them� The person replied, \"No, I don't have food packets to give.\" Although they later gave the beggars some money, Maharaj was not satisfied. He spoke about how important it is to carry food packets at all times. He said, �It is very humiliating to be begging,� and then, in a softer tone, he added, \"It is even more humiliating when you do not give.\" This moment reflects Maharaj's deep compassion for all, regardless of race, caste, age, gender, religion, nationality, or economic status.\n\nThe last story I would like to share is about how much Radhanath Swami Maharaj�s life impacted my father when he visited St. Louis a couple of months ago. My father loves reading books, so I gave him Maharaj's Journey Home. Before reading it, he had never noticed Maharaj's picture on our altar. But once he started reading, he was deeply moved by Maharaj�s life. Later, during a conversation about Maharaj, I took him to our altar and showed him Maharaj�s picture. Immediately, he folded his hands and said, \"You have roamed everywhere, and now you have come here to preach Bhakti to all of us and very mercifully accepted all our prayers.\" He also took notes of Maharaj's messages from Journey Home in his diary to reflect on them and relish them in the future.\n\nThank you all for allowing me to share my offerings, and to Maharaj for showing us how to lead our lives in bhakti with love and dedication.\n\nYour eternally grateful servant and aspiring daughter,\nAmala Radhika dd\n\nHis Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki Jai !!"

And this also shows that you were already quite and wise because you knew who the true Guru was and who could lead you to the right path, and that was our Srila Prabhupada, who showed everyone the path to Krishna not through miracles or powers, but through love.\nJai Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour love for Sri Vrindavan Dham  Your love for the people of Brij and compassion for all living beings, your humility, your perspective on every situation, your gratitude, and your deep connection with Sri Radha Gopinatha�these were the qualities that attracted me towards you. A devotee was explaining that communication doesn't just mean talking, but also listening. The way you listen patiently to everyone teaches us the true meaning of communication. And especially your understanding of how a community of devotees should be, how to move forward in devotion together, how to live in unity�all this especially attracted me to you. But the worry is how I will be able to please you because I am constantly worried that I am unable to surrender to Krishna, and that I cannot do anything properly unless Krishna is at the center. Srila Guru Maharaj, I cannot understand how to love Krishna, how to serve Him, how to please Him, and I am also saddened that I am not able to perform my duties properly.  I'm not doing it, and I feel embarrassed about it. But now I'm so tired of trying that I've given up. I feel hopeless. Please suggest a way out.\n\nDespite knowing that Shila Prabhupada is my grandfather, you are my teacher, and he will never be pleased with such cowardly behavior, I still haven't been performing my duties properly. My mind has become so restless that I can't control it at all, and I don't know what to do, Guru Maharaj. Everything is going wrong.\n\nMaharaj, I want to see you more often, but it's rare to see you from where I live. I've been waiting for you to come to Ujjain for ages, but I'm so degraded that you only come to Madhya Pradesh once a year. This time, I got permission from my parents to go to Ujjain, but I didn't get a chance to have your darshan you. I won't get another chance to see you again, but if you bless me, it's definitely possible. I'll be waiting for you.\n\nWe  I pray to Lord Narasimha for your good health so that you can carry out Srila Prabhupada's orders well. I am a lowly soul and have no power to do anything for you, but it is the power of prayer that will help you accomplish your mission.\n\nYour unworthy daughter,\nBhaktina Aditi (Krishna Bandhu),\nAshok Nagar (Madhya Pradesh)"

You see beyond our faults and awaken our dormant desire to serve.\n\nWhen I look at your life, I see what it means to live for Krishna � constant dedication, tireless preaching, boundless patience, and unconditional love for all souls. You are truly a servant of the servant of the Lord, and your mercy is our only hope.\n\nWhatever little progress I have made on this spiritual path is only because of your guidance and blessings. Without you, I would still be lost in illusion. You have given me the greatest gift � the knowledge of who I really am and what my true purpose in life is.\n\nOn this day, I pray that I may always remain under your shelter, never forget your instructions, and always strive to please you through sincere service. Please bless me that I may one day develop even a fraction of the devotion and compassion that shines so brightly in you.\n\nThank you, Gurudeva, for everything � for your mercy, your patience, your prayers, your love, and your endless sacrifices for our spiritual upliftment. You are my eternal guide, my heart�s inspiration, and my connection to rla Prabhupda and Lord Krishna.\n\nYour humble servant,\nKishori Dave, Abu Dhabi, UAE"

    "Your Offering": "Most Respected Srila Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my prostrated obeisances at your lotus feet.\nAll glories to your holiness! All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n\nMy beloved Guru Maharaj, despite all my disqualifications, I am humbly requesting your blessings and compassionate mercy so that I can practically attempt to express our gratitude through our heartfelt words, body, and mind for the most wonderful gift, \"the seed of pure, unalloyed devotional service,\" which you have mercifully planted in our hearts. Guru Maharaj, every year on this auspicious day of your Vyasa Puja, your glories are revealed more and more, which makes us feel more and more indebted to your lotus feet. When I hear your divine qualities from your Godbrothers and your senior disciples, I feel so fortunate to be a recipient of your mercy. I thank Srila Prabhupada from the bottom of my heart for giving me such a magnificent spiritual master. Guru Maharaj, by your causeless mercy, I am trying to hear your Vani every day without fail, and that gives so much nourishment, so many practical instructions to meditate on and to live a life with real purpose. I am very grateful to HG Rasaraj Gopa Prabhu for sharing amrita droplets in the form of your divine, nectarean speech and quotes on a day-to-day basis that really help us to understand the importance of different auspicious days, the significance of Vaishnava festivals, etc., from your Sri Mukha.\n\nIn Srimad Bhagavatam, during the conversation between Nimi Maharaj and one of the Nava Yogendras named Prabuddha, after the famous verse, \"Tasmad gurum prapadyeta...\" (11.3.21), there is a series of verses about how a disciple should conduct themselves upon receiving initiation, such as the disciple should learn from the spiritual master the science of devotional service, namely hearing, chanting; should learn to disassociate the mind from everything material; should learn to deal properly with all living beings; should learn to be satisfied in any material situation, etc., and so on. Guru Maharaj, you have been cultivating all of us by injecting these aspects through your divine instructions, teachings, and personal conduct for so many decades, and especially in Karthik Yatra, we get the full package of these learning aspects in a condensed form. How mercifully your holiness teaches, trains, and nurtures so many disciples at one place by engaging all of us in profuse hearing, chanting, dancing, serving devotees, etc. We are truly indebted to you, Guru Maharaj, life after life, for not just giving the seed of pure devotional service but also, like a very merciful gardener, always being anxious to nurture it. Guru Maharaj, I need your blessings to understand your mercy deeply and become sincere on this path. I pray to the Lord and to Srila Prabhupada that I keep receiving your divine mercy in the years to come and continue serving you to your satisfaction! During this Karthik Yatra, once again, I was struck with wonder at the way your holiness churns the tattva and Krishna Lila, and co-relates them with practical instructions in our day-to-day life. It is simply inconceivable. Thank you, Guru Maharaj, for giving us shelter in this glorious Guru-Shishya Parampara, in spite of all our disqualifications. Guru Maharaj, you have given us everything (siksha, diksha, sadhana, sastra, dhama, devotees' association, naam kirtan, Krishna prasadam) needed to go back to Godhead.\n\nnama-reha manu api aci-putra atra svarpa\nrpa tasygraja uru-pur mathur gohavat\nrdh-kua giri-vara aho! rdhik-mdhavasam\nprpto yasya prasdt krpay r-guru tam nato 'smi\n\n(Mukta Charita by Srila Raghunath Das Goswami)\n\nBegging for your causeless mercy to develop the right attitude, right motivation, and right desires which may please you and all whom you love in your divine service to Srila Prabhupada. I also beg for your mercy so that I can sincerely follow my vow of initiation and can become an insignificant instrument in this glorious mission of Srila Prabhupada under your shelter. Due to my impure heart and limited ability, I am unable to glorify your divine qualities. Please forgive me, Guru Maharaj, but always keep me under your shelter and under the guidance of your faithful disciples. I do not want anything, Gurudeva, just to serve your lotus feet. Please grant me this desire and accept my imperfect service.\n\nYour unworthy grateful spiritual son,\nPraying for Your Mercy,\nBraja Prakash Das\nKanhaiyadesh (Kuwait)"

These Amrutha droplets uplift all of us, as it nourishes the spiritual relationships, and we are always indebted to you.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, your mantra of pleasing devotees is � pleasing Krishna by serving them. This is very inspiring for a fallen soul like me. You show us the path that the spirit of desire is, a humble servant of the servant of the servant.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, you always stress imbibing the quality of the spirit of submissiveness, simplicity, and dedication to serve. You also stress that we can engage in Krishna�s service properly.\nSuch services Krishna accepts.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, because of your mercy and blessings, and the motivation of Siksha gurus and senior devotees, I could attend the Karthik Mela Mahotsav 2025 at the foothills of Giriraj Govardhan under your auspices.\n\nI want to express my deep feeling of gratitude towards Karthik Mela Mahotsav, where the devotees of the whole world gathered for the divine experience.\nMy heart knew no bounds when I saw your divine presence in front of my eyes. The whole year we wait for this moment to get your merciful glance. I cannot stop myself from thanking Lord Krishna and Srila Prabhupada.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, during the congregation at the foothills of Govardhan, words delivered from your Srimukha took all of us into the divine world of Dwapar Yuga, where the Lord performed His pastimes along with Lord Balarama, Gopas, and Gopis.\n\nYour divine presence on Vyasa asana, surrounded by 12,000 devotees, gave us the feeling of all the Rishis of Naimisaranya as they came to hear Bhagavatam from Suta Maha Muni.\n\nDuring the sankirtan time, everyone present could feel and realize the purification of their souls. And Harinama Ganamrutha from your srimukha was enthralling and reflecting the Chaitanya Maha Prabhu�s Sankirtan movement.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, under your guidance, the Mega Kitchen led by HG Gauranga Prabhu and senior devotees for serving more than 12,000 devotees for 7 days was amazing.\nThe exemplary Samarpan Bhava and commitment displayed by all the devotees was unforgettable � only because of your grace and blessings.\n\nIn my personal experience, I was elated to prepare bhoga for Sri Giri Raj Govardhan as a part of annakuta by using the ancient method of cooking in earthen pots and on iron stoves. And your divine presence amongst us and your merciful glance on me made me feel more responsible towards rendering services. I am very grateful to you, Guru Maharaj, for this causeless mercy.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, after the yearly Karthik yatra celebrations, our celebrations keep continuing while waiting for your Vyasa Puja Mahotsav. These celebrations help us to maintain the same spiritual enthusiasm throughout the year.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, your 3 tips for good mental health, which help in our daily sadhana, are:\n1. Keep good company.\n2. Make positive daily choices.\n3. Have a spiritual practice.\n\nI am very blessed to be in Kanaiya Des (Kuwait) amongst the Siksha gurus, which makes these 3 aspects easily practicable.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, your teachings to smile in adverse conditions do give us the moral boost not only in our spiritual progress but also in dealing with mundane situations.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, as you always say, our chanting will not uplift our consciousness unless we have cooperative, affectionate relationships with each other, and this is evident in Kanaiya Des.\nWe are always grateful to you, Srila Prabhupada, and ISKCON�s Guru Parampara.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, I am very grateful that you have accepted this unworthy fallen soul and given shelter at your lotus feet as your humble servant.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, I beg for your mercy and blessings to progress in Krishna consciousness and remove all my anarthas that have been accumulated over the years and over the lifetimes. I totally surrender unto your lotus feet and beg for your mercy and direction. You are my Spiritual Guru, My father, My everything.\n\nYour insignificant sevika,\nA. Sasikiran Venkateshwar"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Gurumaharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances, all glories to Srila Prabhupada and all glories to you.\nOn birthdays, it is customary to offer gifts, yet I am here today wondering what I can possibly offer you. Instead, I am wondering how I can repay you for the most amazing gift you have given me and keep giving each year, your shelter. Senior devotees have said that you like to know that your disciples pay close attention to your classes and reflect on your message. So, with this in mind, I would like to share a few thoughts in relation to what I have heard from you recently.\n\nIn one of your classes, you mentioned how it is important that we go deep within our hearts to reflect on what we hear and think hard about our understanding. Then we will realize that we cannot actually understand Krishna because how can you understand that the unborn is born and the inactive is active. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu gave this as achintya bheda bheda tattva, but only when Krishna chooses to reveal this in our hearts, we will be able to understand Krishna. In life, we are trained to plan and maintain control of our lives, so sometimes it feels impossible to let go. Due to your regular classes, you remind us to give up the ego and simply surrender. I may be very far from this surrender, but I am hopeful that due to your constant reminders and shelter, I may one day accept Krishna�s promise of protection by simply holding onto your lotus feet.\n\nRecently, I met someone who was asking how we can see all the problems in the world with a spiritual lens. I shared with her something you had said in a class. You had shared that the soul is selfless, but due to the bodily conception and external influences, we forget our true purpose. Therefore, we may not be able to change what we see, but we can try to change the way we live, and by taking shelter of devotees, we learn to serve and share a higher purpose with the world. We may not be able to control the chaos in what we see, but perhaps we can bring some stability into the chaos that otherwise remains in our hearts.\n\nRecently, you were in London, and I was simply observing how you were trying to be personal with each and every one of us immediately after a long flight that had been delayed. You gave a class and described the rasa lila pastime on sharad Purnima, but I was amazed at how you took such an intimate lila and were able to share this in such an expert manner, keeping us focused on the key principles on just how deep Krishna�s love goes. I look back at the first time I met you in New Vrindavan, and even though you had so many responsibilities, I noticed your simplicity in the way you interacted with others, the way in which you attended classes given by others, the way you would call everyone prabhu, which you do even today, and how when the retreat was over, you came with your bag, loaded it in your car, and then drove off. At that point, I knew you were someone special and that I longed for more of your association.\n\nThank you so much for your incredible classes that somehow keep everyone wanting more and for genuinely showing us how to love and care for others.\n\nI ask for your blessings that I can be a good disciple and that I am constantly reminded by you and others to be the servant of the servant of the servant. I will continue to hear your words daily so that I can bathe and cleanse my impurities gradually by your mercy.\n\nYour disciple and servant,\nNimaicandra das"

Your glorious life is a perfect harmony of Sadhana, Seva, Sadachar, Sadhu-sanga, and Svadhyaya � each one shining with the purity of your devotion to Srila Prabhupada and to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. Each of these aspects of your life is exemplary and strengthens and nourishes us immensely on our path of Bhakti.\n\nGurudev, Your sadhana stands as a constant source of inspiration for us. You show us that real happiness and Prema Bhakti comes from the inner connection to the Holy Name. You have always instructed and emphasized sincere, serious, uncompromised, and consistent Sadhana, and you live these instructions with your own example. Chanting beads are your Deities; this epitomizes your immense love and devotion for your Sadhana.\n\nYour seva is love in action � tireless and unmatchable. Your service flows without pause, touching and transforming hearts everywhere. Whether speaking to thousands or caring for one devotee in silence, you serve with such humility, love, and compassion. You teach us that love is in the details and to love is to serve, thus inspiring us to put all our heart and efforts in pleasing the Lord and devotees with selfless service.\n\nGurudev, You show and teach us through your example that sadhu-sanga is not just being in the company of devotees, but cultivating relationships centered on service, humility, and the desire to help each other remember Krishna. You show us that spiritual progress is never an isolated effort; it grows in the warmth of genuine devotee association.\n\nGurudev, Your sadachar, pure character, and impeccable conduct, silently preach louder than words. You embody Srila Prabhupada�s instruction that �purity is the force.� Your every gesture, every word, every interaction radiates kindness and compassion. Through your affectionate and respectful dealings with your Godfamily, senior members of the society, and the devotees, you effortlessly win everyone�s hearts and inspire us to follow in your footsteps.\n\nYour Svadhyaya, O Gurudev, your deep study and contemplation of the scriptures, flows like a stream of nectar nourishing all who hear from you. Every word you speak carries the essence of shastra and realization, turning philosophy into living wisdom that uplifts our hearts and keeps us grounded in our KC.\n\nGurudev, through your life, these five aspects come together like five petals of a lotus flower, each revealing the fragrance of pure love and devotion.\n\nYou concluded this year�s Kartik yatra with the instructions that, to reciprocate to the compassion of Srila Prabhupada and the entire parampara, we should become more determined in Sadhana, to be more determined to not engage in Prajalpa but to hear and chant the glories of the Lord, and find better ways to serve the Lord, to be the servant of the servant of the servant of devotees for the pleasure of the Lord. With this meditation and goal in my heart, I beg and pray for your mercy to give me the strength to honor these instructions and follow in your footsteps in serving Srila Prabhupada�s mission.\n\nPlease continue to keep us in your loving shelter, be our constant well-wisher and guide, as you have always been.\n\nPraying at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath for your continued good health and well-being.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nMadhavi Sundari DD"

You showed how you relished the taste of Krishna's mercy in that prasad.\nThe other thought that came to mind was that of Srila Raghunath Das Goswami. Even he honoured Jagannath Prasad that was rejected even by the cows. Dear Gurudev, please bless that some day I can associate with Vaishnavas who have such developed consciousness and someday get such a taste.\nEgo fails me to realize it.\n\nYou have surely surpassed such a barrier of ego.

You are a true representative and like a mirror image of his qualities that makes me feel like experiencing Srila Prabhupada. Vrindavan was and is so dear to Srila Prabhupada, but he left that loving place just to fulfill the order of his spiritual master Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Swami Prabhupada. Similarly even you love Vrindavan so much but on order of Srila Prabhupada you served at New Vrindavan.\n\nDear Gurudev, you and your Godbrothers resonate the qualities mentioned in every paragraph of the scriptures.

You all are The Moons of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nOn listening to how you personally serve not just your Godbrothers but also other guests, we cannot stop adoring your concern and care and love for others. You show how you cater to details as a sign of your love.\nAs HH Sacchinandan Maharaj had mentioned about your concern even for the beggars. So much compassion. As Srila Prabhupada says that love for Krishna is the natural tendency of us, but we have fallen prey to the contaminations of the material world. You have that natural love for Krishna and the devotees.\n\nHG Gopinath Prabhu mentioned of the counselor system developed by you. How good is the foundation of this system. Gurudev, you have toiled a lot to get this system in place. Your patience and enthusiasm only made it possible. It's only the greatness of parampara that has manifested through you.\n\nYou once tried to tame my ego but I am so unfortunate to not take that instruction in the right manner.\nOn this auspicious day, I beg forgiveness for my offenses unto you, your near and dear ones, and Srila Prabhupada.\nYour glories do not stop here, but please allow me to conclude this offering here.\n\nPlease bless that I serve ISKCON - the very body of Srila Prabhupada.\nPlease allow me to offer my respects to all the authentic Gurus through you.\n\nTrying to be a servant\nYours\nRadhanath Krishna das"

Today, whatever little service I am able to render in Srila Prabhupada�s mission is only because of your unlimited love and attention during those difficult days.\nThough you have many sincere disciples, you have always made even unworthy souls like me feel loved and valued.

This foolish daughter of yours seeks only your mercy to engage her mind in serving you.\nEvery morning before serving the deities, we recite the prayer: �By the mercy of my spiritual master and following in his footsteps I have obtained the fortune to serve the lotus feet of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and SS Radha Kalachandji.�\nThis prayer feels so true to me. I cannot even imagine how such mercy has come upon an undeserving soul like me�it is only and only an example of your compassionate heart. I do not know how to connect or serve Krishna properly, but I have faith that one day, by your mercy, you will engage me in serving Him according to your expectations.\nBy your prayers alone, I have a family today and am serving in SS Radha Kalachandji Dham. Please always keep this unworthy child in your prayers and blessings, so that I may remain enthusiastic to serve devotees, life after life.\nMy prayers to you on this special day is to please engage us (Rasaraj Prabhu, Rasikarani & myself) in your service always, always life after life.\nThank you very very much.\nYour insignificant daughter\nRasakeli devi dasi"

Please accept mental pushpabhisekam with millions of flower petals at your lotus feet!! All glories to dear Srila Prabhupada and to you dear Gurudev, his loving representative!\n\nOn your auspicious 75th Vysa-pj, I offer my heartfelt prayers. May r r Rdh-Krishna and r Caitanya Mahprabhu grant you long life, strength, and unimpeded service so you may continue to illuminate the world with your vapu and v, which are rays of r Nitynanda�s mercy.\n\nYour presence at this year�s Sadhu-saga Retreat in Orlando was a turning point in my spiritual life. Although surrounded by hundreds of devotees, you mercifully answered the questions that had troubled my heart since my initiation in 2019�questions about service, spiritual direction, and whom I should look to as guiding cryas etc. With such compassion, you clarified that my goal should be to become a servant of the servant, and you spoke so beautifully about the life and mood of rla Gopla Bhaa Gosvm. Even without a personal meeting, your words and background pictures on the stage reached directly into my heart. I am forever grateful for this mercy.\n\nTrying to follow your instructions, I have begun adding services that may nourish my bhakti. I joined the Sanskrit meters class taught by HG Amarendra Prabhu. Though I am not a singer, I feel that whatever I learn now is a preparation for future life. I do feel this aligns with your instructions even though I cannot fully understand now. I also plan to join the Bhakti-Vaibhava course offered at our local temple, and I pray for your blessings to imbibe the mood of a sincere listener and follower of rmad-Bhgavatam.\n\nTo make space for these devotional efforts, I stepped back from the advanced accounting course I had been considering. I hope this decision aligns with your desire and pleases you.\n\nThis year also brought profound personal change. My dear father left this world in June at the age of 76. After enduring cancer and tuberculosis, and after great physical suffering, I firmly believe that by his piety, charity, compassionate nature, and constant hearing of rla Prabhupda�s Hare Krishna tape, he attained the Lord�s mercy and went back home. Even though he did not chant on beads, his ears and heart were chanting. When the electricity went out, he asked my mother to continue the recording in any way possible. A week before his departure, the Lord appeared to my mother in a dream, saying He was pleased with my father and would take him back soon without further suffering�and so it happened.\n\nRemembering your teachings and your lotus feet gave me immense solace during this time. Though losing a parent can make one feel orphaned, I knew that you, Gurudev, are always present, always sheltering your disciples through your mercy, your prayers, and your instructions. Thank you Guru Maharaja for being there for us!\n\nI am the useless and unqualified daughter of two great, pious souls who tolerated my shortcomings endlessly. Similarly, I am totally undeserving of the ocean of compassion, attention, and encouragement you give me. Sometimes I feel that if you kicked me in the head, that would be a better utilization of your time.\n\nI deeply appreciate your extraordinary discipline, your control of senses, and your meticulous care for your health�all for the purpose of serving rla Prabhupda and spreading Krishna consciousness. Your dedication inspires us all. Dear Guru Mahrja, you mean more to us than words can express. We pray that you remain with us, guiding us, blessing us, and uplifting us for many, many years.\n\nWishing you unlimited divine health, blissful preaching, and the constant association of loving devotees.\n\nYour utterly useless daughter,\nPushpanjali dasi\nAustin, TX"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna,\nDear Gurudev, His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nGurudev, wishing you a very happy KC birthday. On this auspicious day of your appearance, I wanted to thank you profusely from the bottom of my heart for accepting me and my wife as your disciples on 6th September 2024 and giving us the names Madhav Prem Das and Ramya Radhika DD.\n\nGurudev, I can't imagine what my life would have been without the association of devotees. By the mercy of Sri Sri Radhagopinath ji, I came into association with devotees in the year 2007 when I was in the final year of my graduation and attended a program hosted by a team of devotees in Borivali where over 500 college students came. I was immediately followed up by devotees in Borivali who invited me to Mahavan bace where there were beautiful deities of Jagannath, Baldev, and Subhadra, along with Gaur Nitai. I was quickly drawn to bace programs and weekly satsang programs being conducted specifically for boys, where eminent speakers would come, like His Grace Vraja Bijari prabhu, Mukund Chaitanya Prabhu, Gauranga prabhu, and many others.\n\nI was helped and nicely taken care of by a lot of devotees staying in and as well as outside of bace, like Manish Ahuja, Manish Goel, Madhusudan prabhu, Deepak Prabhu, Kalpit Prabhu, Raj Purohit prabhu, Mayur Vani pr, Krsnamurthy prabhu, Rajat Sharma prabhu, and many others. Most of them are now brahmacharis serving in various capacities at satellite centers of ISKCON Chowpatty, and others are grihasthas.\n\nI received a lot of love, care, and attention from all the devotees that I got attracted to Mridanga, Kartal playing, and also deity dressing, along with SMS sending services, maintenance of the database of devotees coming for boys' programs, and sending out weekly invites to hundreds and more devotees week after week.\n\nAlso, I would design sometimes passes for the Borivali version of Prerna lectures.\n\nI attended many yatras to Tirupati, HAMPI, AHOBILAM, Dwarka, Somnath in the first 5 to 6 years, and seeing everyone together in KC, chanting, eating prasadam, and taking the Lord's darshan kept my faith steadfast in KC.\n\nLater, under the guidance of HG Vraja Bihari prabhu, we also started the Arise India Forum website to publish articles written by him to create awareness about Indian Vedic culture, Hinduism, and related articles that one can't imagine. 15 years ago, this website one fine day received 4 lakh visitors on a single day in the year 2011 and crashed as we didn't have enough planning to cater to such a high volume of visitors on the website.\n\nGradually in 2012, congregation programs started at the same Gopal's Garden venue where we started off with the JOSD program, and many people started to connect and started becoming devotees.\n\nMy faith in KC became stronger and stronger, and in the year 2014, I went to Sridham Mayapur for the first time, where I saw devotees chanting and dancing from across the world. That was like a real united nations that further attracted me to KC.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, my connection was established with you, O Gurudev, when myself and my wife had some difficulty convincing our parents and then finalizing the date for our wedding to marry a KC partner. We would together pray every day, first thing after waking up from our respective homes, to you and SSRG ji for help and guidance, and everything happened smoothly after that.\n\nAs we heard many stories at that time from HG Anand Vrindavan prabhu about how you helped him and went and sat at his home personally to take care of your disciple.\n\nOur faith in your words, O Gurudev, grew stronger day by day, listening to your lectures on Chaitanya Charitamrita and Srimad Bhagavatam that always attracted us to KC.\n\nIt was somewhere in November/December, exactly 10 years ago, we heard your voice for the very first time without a mic when we had an opportunity to share with you our wedding invite. You accepted it so happily and blessed us both, me and my wife Ramya Radhika (Riya at that time).\n\nBy the mercy of HG Gauranga Prabhu, I also had an opportunity to work on a marketing campaign for one of your talks at Bombay Stock Exchange on water conservation that was attended by over 300 to 400 people. All of these people had signed up through online advertisement done by me, and the management team of Earth Forum was really happy with the outcome. This was the time when Gauranga prabhu introduced me to you, and once again, I had the opportunity to see you and meet you face to face.\n\nGurudev, during the time of your book release, \"Journey Home,\" when many devotees would take your autograph on the book, and I didn't have a copy of your book, you still very graciously wrote your initial R and circled it with a pen on my diary.\n\nGurudev, later, my wife and I were nicely taken care of by HG Sridama Prabhu and Kishori Mataji as we moved to grihastha ashram, and they shared many of your pastimes with them, which further attracted us to you and your divine mercy. And then we have been nicely taken care of by HG Rasaparayan prabhu and Gopi Manjari Mataji.\n\nThrough the annual drama, you gave many opportunities to take your darshan and your personal association year after year, when after the end of the drama, you would come and meet all the actors and artists. Thank you for entrusting me with the service of drama sound that would please you and devotees.\n\nThank you, Gurudev, for creating so many opportunities for us to serve through Radhagopinath mandir and its community of devotees through book distribution, bace programs, congregation programs, annual yatras and dramas, and the wonderful Govardhan Eco Village that you gave us all.\n\nOn this most auspicious day of your Vyas Puja, I find myself reflecting on the immeasurable impact you�ve had on my life. While I may not have the opportunity to always immerse myself in spiritual activities as much as I desire, your teachings and example provide me with an anchor in the storm of my daily responsibilities towards office and family.\n\nMaharaj, your words and actions remind me that even in the midst of life�s chaos, there is always a chance to connect with Krishna and serve with sincerity.\n\nYour unwavering dedication to Srila Prabhupada�s mission and your compassion for every soul inspire me to do better in whatever time I can dedicate.\n\nIt is your example of humility, love, and selfless service that motivates me to strive for balance in my life and to ensure that Krishna remains at the center, even when the material world pulls me in every direction.\n\nYour ability to transform lives with your wisdom and genuine care is a testament to the depth of your spiritual realization, and I feel blessed to have received even a fraction of your guidance through you and the community of devotees of SSRGM.\n\nOn this occasion, I humbly pray for your blessings so that I may continue to grow in devotion and learn to better serve Guru, Krishna, and their devotees, that I always remember Krishna and never forget Krishna.\n\nGurudev, it is you and Krishna who do everything in the background, but others and I feel that I am doing it. \"Karte ho tum Kanhaiya, mera naam ho raha hai.\"\n\nYou always took care through all the ups and downs of our life. I had 10+ job changes in 15+ years of work experience, but I was never without a job, because of which our financials were always secure.\n\nYour lectures always give us that hope and always give answers to whatever problems that life throws at us.\n\nGurudev, I want to pray at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radhagopinath ji on this auspicious day of your Vyas Puja that He always keeps you healthy and gives you immense strength to touch the hearts of millions of people across the world, which you are already doing.\n\nThank you, thank you, Gurudev, for giving us Radhagopinath ji, Srila Prabhupada, and the best of both worlds�senior devotees in our life like Vraja Bihari Prabhu, Anand Vrindavan prabhu, Gauranga prabhu, Govind Prabhu, Radhagopinath prabhu, and grihastha counselors like Sridama Prabhu, Kishori Mataji, Rasaparayan prabhu, Gopi Manjari Mataji, and several others, that we remain on track in KC.\n\nAt home, thank you for giving us deities of Nimai Nitai and Prahlad Narsimhadev and a wonderful devoted wife Ramya Radhika and a lovely child Divyam, and friends like Govind Prem and Radhika Prem and several other friends.\n\nThank you, dear Gurudev. We love you lots from the bottom of our heart.\n\nAspiring to be your servant,\nMadhav Prem, Ramya Radhika, and Divyam.\n\nHis Holiness Radhanath Maharaj ki jai! Srila Prabhupada ki jai! Jai!"

Your life is the perfect commentary on the ikakam, teaching us what it truly means to be a servant of Krishna.\nOur purpose in recounting these is twofold: firstly, to glorify your transcendental qualities which effortlessly attract the hearts of all living entities; and secondly, for our own purification, as reflecting upon your perfect character inspires us to sincerely follow your instructions.\n\n1. Radical Humility and Universal Respect\nMaharaj, one of the most profound qualities that illuminates your personality is your profound humility (td api suncena). You do not merely preach respect; you live it by honoring every soul, regardless of their external designation or religious background. This was exemplified during your treatment in Kerala, when you consistently offered pranms to your Muslim driver, concluding with full daavats at the airport.\nThis act speaks volumes. The elderly driver, accustomed to serving the world�s most powerful kings and sheikhs, broke down in tears, stating that no one had ever shown him such profound respect. In that moment, you demonstrated that your vision is purely spiritual, transcending material designations of caste, creed, or wealth. It inspires me to cultivate the necessary humility to practice mnadena in all my interactions.\n\n2. Unwavering Absorption in the Holy Name (Verse 1: ceto-darpaa-mrjana...)\nMaharaj, Your life is a profound example of dedicated absorption in krtana and japa which is the foundational instruction of the ikakam (ceto-darpana-marjanam).\nReports from your close servants confirm that they have observed you chanting throughout the night on many occasions, yet you still begin your morning program the next day without fail. Furthermore, before yatras (travels) or important engagements, you are known to sit alone with a harmonium and sing for four or five hours. This demonstrates that your \"head and heart are always dedicated to Krishna.\" The accounts of your tireless dedication to the Holy Name, chanting through the night, motivate me daily.\n\n3. Unwavering Loyalty and Causeless Devotion (Verse 4: na dhana na jana na sundar... bhavatd bhaktir ahaituk tvayi)\nYour unwavering loyalty to the spiritual master's body (ISKCON), even when it is challenging, perfectly embodies Verse 4 of ikakam �na dhana na jana na sundar... bhavatd bhaktir ahaituk tvayi�.\nDuring a Vyasa Puja celebration, a young lady who had left ISKCON due to turmoil and financial instability confronted You, Maharaj, challenging why You had not left ISKCON despite its troubles. You immediately replied by referencing rla Prabhupda�s statement that ISKCON is his body. You acknowledged that the body may be \"bleeding\" and have \"some wounds,\" but as a son, it is Your responsibility not to leave Your father when he is injured, but rather to care for him. You stressed, \"I could never ever leave ISKCON because rla Prabhupda said ISKCON is his body.\" This act is the ultimate demonstration of your dedication, proving that your spiritual identity is defined entirely by your service, regardless of external difficulties or personal cost. Maharaj, your profound commitment to rla Prabhupda's body, ISKCON, redefined what loyalty means for me.\n\n4. The Transforming Power of Unconditional Affection\nYour pure, unreserved love has the power to melt away any contamination and instantly transform a person's life. We saw this with the slum youth who confronted you with such harsh and vulgar language. Instead of reacting, you simply embraced him. He broke down weeping, and the change was instant. The very next day, he started coming to the temple, and for three years, he would place a rose outside your door every time he visited. This story shows us that your genuine warmth and a single, non-judgmental embrace can completely re-route a soul's journey. This incident motivates me to always lead with empathy rather than critique.\nConclusion\n\nMaharaj, I pray to the Supreme Lord for Your divine health, long life, and continued inspiration to guide countless souls. We pray that we may internalize these teachings by trying to serve others without distinction and with genuine respect.\nPlease empower us to follow your instructions so that we may one day be worthy to stand as tiny particles of dust at your lotus feet.\nMay Your blessings shower upon me and my family, enabling us to make spiritual progress and dedicate our lives to Your service."

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisance at your lotus feet.\nAll glories to you, all glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nThe vyasapuja offering means glorification of the spiritual master. Actually, the disciple's only strength is contemplating the glories of a spiritual master. That is the only saving grace for the disciple. Otherwise, he has to glorify Maya. The disciple receives mercy from the spiritual master through his instructions and conducts his life by that instruction, then he will get realization. So, the vyasapuja day is an opportunity to share that realization with the spiritual master, so that the spiritual master will be pleased. When the spiritual master is pleased, then the disciple's spiritual life will be successful. Yasya prasadat bhagavat prasado, yasya prasada na gati ki topi.\n\nGuru Maharaj, the more I am hearing from different sources, the more I am able to understand the importance of the association of sadhus. Without hearing from a sadhu, one cannot understand the glories of devotional service. That is why the Vedas are called Shruti. The purpose of Vedic literature is to awaken the relationship with Krishna. But it should be understood by hearing from a pure devotee. Even though I am not able to get your physical association, through your different lectures like S.B. Classes or yatras or seminars, by your teachings, I am able to see and connect to Krishna through my life, or to this world. Without approaching the sadhu or hearing from him, human life is meaningless. Srila Prabhupada, in every purport, he mentioned that one should approach a bonafide spiritual master and hear from him and follow his instructions.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I am experiencing that unless one comes to the association of sadhus, his real spiritual life will not begin. One may be very austere, one may be very expert in Vedic literature, one may be very pious, still, one must approach a sadhu. In the present situation, people are not very austere, not very inquisitive, and not interested in reading scriptures, but they want to see role models in society. It means by seeing an exemplary person, one may become interested in spiritual life, then they will approach a sadhu. You are one of the exemplary sadhus to this world. Recently, in the Kartik yatra, devotees from all over the world came to Guriraj Govardhan just to take association from you and hear from you. All types of devotees are children, youth, old, and women. Just by seeing you, people think that here is a religious person; he brings us to a spiritual platform. Actually, your lifestyle and your speech are most important to this society. Just by seeing you and hearing from you, they will connect to God and they will be happy. The six days during the yatra, we completely forgot our household activities, our material life, and all our domestic activities. You made us absorbed hearing about the Lord, worshipping the Lord, taking darshan of the Lord, and engaging in the service of the Lord. We felt so happy. You showed us during this yatra how we can live our whole life in the association of devotees and at the same time how to live in this world. You said that the actual yatra begins after we leave, during this 6-day yatra. So, this is how I am understanding the importance of sadhus, Maharaj.\n\nGuru Maharaj, you left home from your childhood, you left your most loving parents, you left the worshipable land, and you met so many babas, saints, renouncers, and you met many monks, just to find a guru. To meet a genuine sadhu, you did so much austerity in your life. You walk towards a sadhu, but Krishna walks towards a sadhu like you. You reached the lotus feet of a pure devotee, that is Srila Prabhupada, and Srila Prabhupada gave you the holydham of Goloka Vrindavan. Guru Maharaj, you came to India to give the association of sadhus; Srila Prabhupada went to America to teach the value of saintly person association to people in general.\n\nGuru Maharaj, your heart is filled with the glories of Srila Prabhupada. Whatever you do, whatever you speak, and all your actions are representative of Srila Prabhupada. The success of a person in spiritual life is attached to sadhus. Acharya also says that to become a sadhu, one should associate with sadhus. To become a pure devotee, one should associate with pure devotees. It is always touching my heart that in all your lectures, there is a glorification of Srila Prabhupada. That is how you are feeling grateful and how you are blessed by Srila Prabhupada and all the Acharyas in the disciplic succession. In the same way, you are teaching me how I should be grateful in the association of your lotus feet and rendering some service to your lotus feet.\n\nRegularly hearing from you, I am able to experience the happiness that comes from pure devotional service. Krishna consciousness is such a blissful process one can experience in the beginning itself. In other processes, it is only fruitless labor. A person may follow different religions, one may be very austere, he may be a much-influenced person, he may be a very scholarly person, he may worship different demigods, but unless one comes to the association of a pure devotee, he will not be successful. In the association of a pure devotee, one can be protected by Maya, one can be happy, one can understand the relationship with Krishna, and one can develop love for Krishna. In the association of a pure devotee only, one can be free from sinful activity. I am very grateful to you, Maharaj; by your causeless mercy, today I am able to understand the glories of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nA true sadhu always exhibits all the qualities in all circumstances. From his point of view, there is no good or bad, pain & pleasures, heat and cold, and happiness & distress. Just by seeing you, one will develop all these qualities. Darshana Pavitra koro-ei tomara guna. Actually, a sadhu is living Bhagavata. Just by hearing from you, just by serving you, one will understand the book Bhagavata. A living bhagavata and book bhagavata will give only qualities and devotion. I am experiencing there is no difference between book bhagavata and person bhagavata. When I contemplate all your qualities, my heart moves to devotional service. Bhagavatam explains about the Mrigari hunter. Just by association with Narada Muni, he became such a wonderful saint. There are so many examples in the Srimad Bhagavatam. Guru Maharaj, you are like that; you are always giving challenges to become humble, but I am failing in that area. How many times have you told me, trnadapi sunechana taroriva sahisnuna, amanena manadena kirtaniya sadahari. When circumstances come in such a way, I am a victim of a false ego. As you said, the quality of a sadhu is always looking for descending mercy. That means one who is in love with his spiritual master, he can conquer anything. Sadhu means cutting the knots of the disciple. The more a disciple gives an opportunity to a sadhu by means of surrender, the more he will be free from sinful activity.\n\nGuru Maharaj, on this very auspicious occasion, I am deeply praying at your lotus feet; please give me your blessing to understand the qualities of your heart. Let me become more and more humble. Let me cooperate with everyone; this is Srila Prabhupada's desire, not to compare anyone, rather cooperate with everyone. And engage me in the service of Srila Prabhupada's mission and your lotus feet.\n\nThank you so much, Guru Maharaja.\n\nPlease forgive all my offenses at your lotus feet.\nYour insignificant aspiring servant,\nLokeshwar Govinda dasa."

After coming into Bhakti, I came to know this movement was started by Prabhupad, and he spread it all over the world. But how I got this opportunity is only due to your causeless mercy. I came to know that under your grace, HG Radheshyam Prabhuji started youth preaching, and under him, HG Adigopal Prabhuji, HG Pankajgop Prabhuji, and HG Siddeshgaurang Prabhuji started VOICE in Nanded, named as Nandgaon VOICE. And under them, my mentors HG Narayanrishi Prabhuji and Aditya P, and my cousin brother who was already practicing Krsna consciousness, helped me a lot to take up Bhakti. First of all, I offer my respectful and humble obeisances to all of these devotees. There are a lot of devotees who influenced my life and encouraged my devotional service; due to them, I am holding on to Krsna consciousness.\n\n\t\t\tGurudev, I have understood or not, I don�t know this Bhakti process, because I have not taken it seriously. Please forgive me, but honestly, I am not listening to Prabhupad's lectures and your lectures. I know I should hear them, but the force inside me takes me away. I am very much distracted by social media. I want to become sincere, but I am not able to control myself. I want to practice Krsna consciousness throughout my life and life after, in association with devotees only. But looking inside, I find I am not at all eligible for that; surely, in some days, Krsna will kick me out from Bhakti. But I don�t want to leave Krsna consciousness at any cost. Gurudev, please forgive me; I don�t know what I should offer to you. But I want to open my heart to you today. I don�t know whether you will read this or not, but my counselor had told me if we are sincere, then our Guru has a heart-to-heart connection; he understands everything. But I am a sinful person.\n\n\t\t\tGurudev, please forgive me. I think I was supposed to offer something good happening to feel you happy, that your aspiring disciples are happy in Krsna consciousness. But Guru Maharaj, I want to offer my life to Krsna, but I am holding on to Anarthas. Gurudev, please help me to get out from the Anarthas.\n\n\t\t\tI am bewildered by this material energy. I am now trying to get a job and practice Krsna consciousness for a stable life. But not getting a job, and due to this, my practice of Krsna consciousness is hampered. Honestly speaking, before also I was not that much serious, but from that also I have gone down.\n\n\t\t\tGurudev, at last, I beg forgiveness at your lotus feet because even after coming into Krsna consciousness and associating with devotees for a long period of time, I am still a dull-headed, sinful person, holding on to anarthas in my heart.\n\n\t\t\tI beg at your lotus feet, please award me with ruchi in chanting the holy names of the Lord, strength to fight with anarathas, and to practice this Krsna consciousness in the association of devotees life after life. Maharaj, I am dull-headed. Please accept me; please don�t reject me.\n\n\t\t\tAnd please forgive me; I don�t know exactly what I can offer to Guru Maharaj. I chose to open my heart before you, Maharaj.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour Humble Servant\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Sagar"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nRecently I listened to HG Vraj Bihari Prabhu�s offering for your 75th Vyasa-Puja. He shared how, in a recent counselors� meeting, everyone asked you what gift should be offered to you on your 75th Vyasa-Puja day. And you replied that not just for this Vyasa-Puja, but anytime in the future, if anyone asks what gift you desire, your answer will always remain the same � and that answer includes the five points below.\n\nThese are not only your instructions for us � they are qualities you have personally lived as a true acharya, one who teaches by example. You never ask anyone to do anything that you yourself have not practiced in your own life. You always walk your talk. And I wanted to express in this offering that the same five �gifts� you expect from us are the very same gifts you yourself have been offering to Srila Prabhupada throughout your life.\n\nBefore expanding on each of them, I humbly delineate the five gifts you desire:\n\n1. Go deep into hearing, chanting, and service\n2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Guru and Krishna\n3. Remain united as a community\n4. Maintain enthusiasm to share bhakti\n5. Never compromise on the quality of bhakti\n\n1. Go Deep Into Hearing, Chanting & Service\n\nYour early brahmachari years in New Vrindavan are a living example of this instruction. You were constantly engaged in service, and in the brief moments between aratis you would dive into Srila Prabhupada�s books with great relish.\n\nI especially remember one Janmashtami night around 2002 or 2003, close to 1:30 a.m., when you joined a small gathering of us and lovingly shared how those few minutes of reading in between aratis were among the sweetest moments of your spiritual life.\n\nYou always sat in the same spot near Hanumanji, surrounded by brahmacharis, chanting with such intensity that the entire atmosphere of the temple transformed.\n\nYour festival lectures � consistent year after year � revealed how deeply you had studied and realized those pastimes. And after hearing Srila Prabhupada�s lecture in the morning, you would eagerly share the essence with the brahmacharis the very same afternoon, sometimes even making it the theme of the next Sunday Feast class.\n\nFrom you we learned that true depth in bhakti comes only through steady hearing, sincere chanting, and tireless service.\n\n2. Cultivate the Mood of Pleasing Guru and Krishna\n\nOver the years, we have seen how you always strive not only to please Guru and Krishna, but also to please your God brothers.\n\nYou taught us that pleasing Guru includes loving Krishna, following instructions, imbibing Guru�s mood, dedicating one�s life to Guru�s mission, and understanding and supporting Guru�s projects.\n\nI remember you once telling the brahmacharis, �I have given you all you need. Now it is your responsibility to carry on the legacy � temple, congregation, projects��\n\nGauranga Prabhu once narrated that Srila Prabhupada had said that in the early years ISKCON consisted mostly of Westerners, and therefore there was a need to preach to Indians. Today the situation has reversed. Understanding Srila Prabhupada�s balanced mood, you are once again successfully attracting Western seekers � especially through Govardhan Eco Village and the Bhakti Center in New York.\n\nAnd even with these expanding projects, you have never compromised your principle of �people over projects.�\n\n3. Remain United as a Community\n\nUnity has always been your core teaching.\n\nWhen you were with the brahmacharis, you would genuinely glorify the Grihasthas � their hard work, donations, and participation in temple programs. And when you were with the Hrihasthas, you would glorify the brahmacharis � their simplicity, sacrifice, and renunciation.\n\nWithin ISKCON, you consistently taught us to respect every devotee � Prabhupada�s disciples and disciples of other Gurus.\n\nI vividly remember your instruction to Bhagavatam speakers: never say �my Guru Maharaj,� and not even casually say �Maharaj.� We had to say �Radhanath Swami says�� so that no listener � even if not your disciple � felt excluded or disconnected.\n\nExcept during Vyasa-puja, we were strictly prohibited from publicly chanting your pranam mantra or saying �Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki jai,� even in your absence. This sensitivity demonstrated your deep concern for unity.\n\nDuring book distribution marathon, you would say: �Distribute more than last year � but let Chowpatty come last � so that other temples distribute even more and Srila Prabhupada�s mission expands.�\n\nYour humility and awareness taught us that unity must always take precedence over prestige.\n\n4. Enthusiasm to Share Bhakti\n\nWhen I served in guest reception, I constantly saw your enthusiasm in meeting newcomers � whether in your small room, in the temple hall, or whenever special guests arrived.\n\nI took great pleasure in bringing guests to meet you, and you never refused � even when you were not feeling well. My greatest joy was seeing the warmth and satisfaction on your face when I introduced someone new.\n\nAnd we have all witnessed how this same enthusiasm extends across the world � how you travel extensively wherever you are invited to teach and share Krishna consciousness. You speak in corporates, temples, universities, parliaments, television interviews, meetings with celebrities, politicians, dignitaries, and also the simplest common people. Your compassion never discriminates. Your eagerness to share bhakti never diminishes.\n\n5. Never Compromise on the Quality of Bhakti\n\nSrila Prabhupada said, �Now is the time to boil the milk� � to focus on training and caring for the devotees we already have.\n\nBhagavad-gita teaches the same principle: Krishna accepts the quality of devotion, not the quantity (�patram pushpam phalam toyam�). And from your New Vrindavan days until today, we have seen that wherever there is genuine quality, Krishna naturally brings quantity.\n\nMy Prayer:\n\nOn your 75th Vyasa-puja, I sincerely pray:\n� For your good health\n� For unlimited empowerment in uplifting and inspiring Western audiences\n� And for your mercy, so that I may cultivate these five gifts in my own life and offer them to you not only on Vyasa-puja day, but every single day\n\nYour servant,\nGokulananda Das"

Once in Jagannath Puri, at Tota Gopinath temple, I was sitting in the temple after paying for the coupon and eagerly waiting for the Lord�s prasadam. A stranger, who was not even an ISKCON member, but seeing me in my dhoti and kurta attire, asked me, �From ISKCON�\n�Yes,� I replied. He further asked, �Which temple are you from� I said, �Chowpatty, Mumbai.� He asked again, �Who is your Guru� I said, �HH. Srila Radhanath Swami.�\nSuddenly, he gave a big smile and said, �Oh, then your life is perfected.� That day, I did not take it so seriously. But when I reflect on those words now, I realize that actually, I do not have any qualifications apart from one: that you have accepted me as your disciple.\nDear Gurudev, on this auspicious occasion of your birthday, I wish to promise you again that I will always try to be a sincere devotee and will make sure that I fulfill all my vows given to you at the time of initiation. I will also preach and serve till my last breath in whatever capacity I have.

The teacher has to consider time, candidate, and country. He must avoid the principle of niyamagraha, that is, he should not try to perform the impossible. What is possible in another [country or situation], is not necessarily possible here. The acarya's duty is to accept the essence of devotional service.

Still, I fail to justify it as I don�t know where to start to count my blessings, but I want to take this opportunity on the occasion of your Vyasa Puja to remind myself of my good fortune and not to take this mercy for granted.\n\nThis year has been one of the most challenging years for me personally, and sometimes, I am still in disbelief at how I am managing this situation, but when I reflect on it, it's all because of what I have heard from your classes and read in your books over the years.\nYou have mentioned in your book about the two dogs that reside within our hearts�the good dog and the bad dog. You speak about how everyone has a battle internally whenever we experience a challenging situation. I never understood the depth of this analogy until I experienced something in my life that required me to practically apply this principle. It's been a test for me to curtail tendencies of envy, anger, and arrogance. Although it's been difficult, your life, teachings, and words have encouraged me to try the practice of forgiveness, self-control, and humility.\n\nThere are so many things one could speak about you and your glorious qualities, and I will fall short of glorifying many of your qualities, but I just want to share one instance: this year, I heard the Kartik yatra classes online as I didn't have the fortune to travel, and during the first day of the class, HH Sacinandana Maharaj said that we are all fortunate to have the best guide in the sacred land of Vrindavan, which is you. In the class, you went on to speak about how Srila Prabhupada carried the important message of Lord Caitanya, leaving Vrindavan, which was to reveal the glories of Vrindavan through chanting the holy name of the Lord and developing a sincere taste for hearing. This made me realize that you were also following this in the mood of a servant of servants, like you expect from your disciples, by connecting with many souls around the world�materially successful, philanthropists, business leaders, celebrities, and many more�inspiring them to chant the holy name of the Lord, to visit holy dham, and simultaneously you're organizing the biggest Kartik yatra in India! What more could you do to convey the important message of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.\nYou perfectly exemplify your talk and action, which inspires me to be attentive in hearing and trying to implement in my life.\n\nI haven't had the fortune of seeing you for almost 3 years now, and it feels like a great misfortune, but I've had the good fortune of serving some of your disciples and pray that I continue to get such opportunities. Maharaj, everyone is going through a lot of challenging situations in their life, and I realized that I have felt comfortable in fleeting moments of happiness, but in sober moments, I realize how there is a constant need to take shelter, and having a spiritual father like you has been one of my biggest blessings in my life, and I try to ask myself, \"How would Maharaj react if I were to speak a certain way or take action in a certain manner\" I have many times failed in performing in a way to please you, but I can say that I have started to be aware of it and am begging for your forgiveness, and I will keep trying to be better, so that someday I can be a better individual and serve in a way to please you and the guru parampara.\nPlease bless me on this auspicious occasion of your Vyasa-puja and pray for your ever good health.\n\nWishing you a very happy Vyasa Puja Gurudev�Radhanath Swami ki Jai!!\nYour humble servant,\nAnjaneya Tirtha Das"

You are kind, peaceful, and charitable like Srila Prabhupada, while also being firmly convinced of your spiritual identity.\nYour commitment to servant leadership, leading by example, and your deep spiritual maturity and faith make you a true spiritual leader of human society today. This has been possible by your great qualities like careful and patient listening, empathy, healing, persuasion, and commitment to the growth of the people you deal with. You are a true visionary with a unique ability to see the future and inspire others to achieve it with strategic thinking, creativity, persistence, optimism, and excellent communication skills.

All these qualities were visible starting with your early days in New Vrindavan as the lone pujari serving Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Chandra, followed by University preaching in Ohio, developing and growing Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Temple in Chowpatty into a thriving community and spiritual center as we see today, conceiving and developing Govardhan Eco Village, and many large-scale humanitarian and social initiatives, like Bhakti Vedanta Hospital, Midday Meal Program for children, schools, and orphanages, etc.\nCurrently, you are one of the world�s most beloved and respected spiritual teachers who is guiding human society by emphasizing spiritual principles of Bhakti Yoga and social service.\nI do not think I will be able to glorify your transcendental qualities enough with my limited knowledge and capacity.\nI am an unworthy, unqualified, and fallen soul, yet you are merciful to give me shelter at your lotus feet by accepting me as your disciple and have given me the greatest gift of Krishna consciousness. I pray to be ever grateful for the mercy and compassion you have shown upon me.\nI am full of faults and shortcomings in serving you, for which I beg for your forgiveness. I pray my actions will always reflect my gratitude to you by faithfully serving those you love.\n\nYour servant,\nRathayatra dasa"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my most humble and repeated obeisances at your divine lotus feet.\nAll glories to rla Prabhupda.\n\nOn this sacred occasion of your 75th Vyasapuja, I bow with a heart filled with deep gratitude. Whatever I express here is only a very small attempt to glorify you, for your qualities are unlimited, while my ability is extremely limited. Still, the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition teaches that glorifying the spiritual master is a sacred duty of the disciple, and therefore I offer this humble submission at your lotus feet.\n\nThis past year has been the most transformative year of my life. By your causeless mercy, I received initiation from you on Dussehra day in Nashik. The four days of your association during that time were deeply life-changing. Your krtans, your gentle presence, and your compassionate dealings with each devotee made me feel that Krishna�s kindness was directly touching my heart. Although many devotees were gathered, you made each of us feel personally acknowledged. Such attention and affection are the true signs of a pure Vaishnava.\n\nReceiving your shelter opened my eyes to my own weaknesses. I see how restless and proud my mind often is, how easily I become distracted, and how quickly I forget spiritual priorities. Yet, instead of discouragement, your example fills me with hope. Your teachings guide me in every area of life�whether in my duties at MSEDCL, in family responsibilities, or when I attempt to preach in villages with hesitation and lack of confidence. Your words and actions show me how to live with sincerity, humility, and dedication.\n\nGuru Maharaj, on 7th August 2025, by your blessings and by Krishna�s mercy, my wife and I were gifted with a baby boy. We feel that he has come into our lives through the prayers and blessings of Vaishnavas. Our sincere desire is that he may grow up imbibing the qualities you embody�compassion, simplicity, gratitude, service, and devotion to the Holy Name. We pray that our home becomes a place where your teachings are practiced daily and where the Holy Name remains the center of our lives.\n\nYour life, Guru Maharaj, is a living example of Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy. The scriptures declare skd-dharitvena samasta strai�that the guru is the transparent representative of the Supreme Lord�yet simultaneously the most humble servant. Both these truths shine beautifully in you. Your humility reminds me of Haridsa hkura, who considered himself lower than the straw in the street. Your compassion echoes the boundless mercy of Nitynanda Prabhu. Your unwavering dedication to rla Prabhupda�s mission reflects the spirit of the Six Gosvms, who lived only for Mahprabhu�s purpose.\n\nYour krtans awaken devotion.\nYour lectures illuminate the heart.\nYour personal example inspires transformation.\n\nThrough your life, I understand in a practical way the qualities that rla Rpa Gosvm described in a pure Vaishnava�expert engagement, gentleness, gratitude, and boundless compassion. To witness these qualities in a living person is the greatest fortune of my life.\n\nDespite your mercy, I remain full of shortcomings. My chanting often lacks depth, my mind becomes restless, and my service attitude is inconsistent. Yet I continue to hold on to your teachings with sincerity, hoping to grow steadily in spiritual life. I pray that I may develop deeper devotion, humility, and steadiness in my practices. I pray that my responsibilities as a householder and as a servant in my profession become offerings that reflect the values you teach. I aspire to assist, even in small ways, in sharing Krishna consciousness through my behavior and interactions with others.\n\nGuru Maharaj, if I can imbibe even a fraction of your compassion, my life will become meaningful. If I can remember your teachings during difficult moments, I will remain protected by the strength they carry. Your instructions are a guiding force in my life, giving clarity and direction in times of uncertainty.\n\nOn this most auspicious 75th Vyasapuja, I offer my heart, my family, my abilities, and my future at your lotus feet. Whatever little I have, may it be used in ways that bring joy to your heart and contribute to your mission.\n\nYour servant,\nNiladri Das "

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances,\n\nAlthough I have been hearing your lectures for many days, it was only after reading your book The Journey Home that I truly understood who you are and how you think. It deeply inspired me, and I could relate to it in many ways. Your childhood experiences, natural simplicity, humility, faith in the Supreme Lord � even during a time when you did not yet know who the Supreme God is � all these things astonished me. For the first time, I felt that someone�s thought process resonated so strongly with my own heart.\n\nIt is only because of you that I took Krishna Consciousness seriously. From you, I learned the true importance of devotional service in my life. My faith in Srila Prabhupada and the process he has given has grown steadily simply by hearing you, observing you, and reading the philosophy through your lectures. Your lectures have become my life and soul. Even though my memory is short and not very sharp, and I cannot grasp deep philosophical points easily, your teachings give me clear direction about what to do and what to avoid in order to progress. Even though I fail many times due to my anarthas, it is your guidance that gives me the way forward.\n\nI am often amazed how Srila Prabhupada�s lectures, your lectures, and my daily book reading all revolve around the same points. This indicates to me that your mercy is bringing the blessings of the entire Guru Parampara into my life, despite my fallen condition.\n\nThrough your lectures, I learned how miserable the material world is and how essential it is for every sdhaka to have a proper plan for leaving this world. But that was just the beginning. As your lectures progressed level by level, I was gradually introduced to deeper aspects of Krishna Consciousness � from the basics of body and soul, to devotional service, our relationship with God, spiritual emotions and pastimes, and later even more advanced topics like devotee care, rasa, and complete sacrifice. At first it felt overwhelming, like giving a heavy feast to someone with a weak digestion. But with the guidance of my superiors � who are your mercy agents through the counsellor system you established � I continued. Slowly my conviction developed, my faith increased, and I could digest these teachings and understand the real picture.\n\nGradually, I realized the great danger of Vaiava-apardha, the importance of offering respect to others, the formula for avoiding offenses through td api suncena, the necessity of prayer, the tendency to take things cheaply and how to overcome it, and how Supersoul guides us at every moment if we learn to hear Him. This journey of hearing your lectures and being introduced to different aspects of bhakti has been truly adventurous, and for me it still continues with the same excitement. I pray that I may receive more and more shelter of your vani, and by your mercy understand how you want me to serve you, Srila Prabhupada, and the devotees.\n\nYou are known for your exemplary behavior � your sadacara. Your dealings with your Godbrothers, senior disciples, junior disciples, and followers teach us how to behave in devotee association and how to care for others by bringing them closer to Krishna. Whatever you speak in your lectures, you follow perfectly in your conduct. It is said that one cannot become a perfect guru without first being a perfect disciple. The way you followed Srila Prabhupada�s teachings and engaged others in the same is a shining example.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I feared taking things cheaply, because I had that tendency. But I never wanted that in spiritual life. Your lectures always emphasize quality over quantity, and using quantity to eventually improve quality. You constantly teach how to remain conscious in every activity � not mechanical in service, sadhana, or relationships � and how to put our full heart and soul into everything we do. You teach attention to detail, serving not for show but for purification, and aiming for Krishna-prema.\n\nWhen someone asked you which is the highest level of devotee, everyone expected you to quote td api suncena, yet you quoted liya v pda-rat�. Your lectures always focus on pure devotional service � nothing less. Still, you wonderfully engage all types of people in Krishna Consciousness. How your lectures satisfy such a variety of hearts according to their level of realization is a mystery for me.\n\nIn every aspect, your message remains the same: aim for quality with full consciousness � performing sadhana without pride, serving with humble servant-of-servant mood, remaining grateful, not judging or comparing, giving our best in every situation, never compromising in sadhana, and realizing Krishna through humble service rather than merely speaking about Him. These are the teachings I am striving to follow.\n\nOne of your greatest blessings upon me is giving me shelter of the leaders trained by you � HG RSP, HG CCP, HG Gauranga Prabhu, my counsellor, and many others. They are your mercy agents, constantly guiding and protecting fallen souls like me. Through them you care for me in every aspect, especially in overcoming pride. Whatever little effort I am making comes from the inspiration you have given through your lectures.\n\nThe importance of prayer has changed my life. It has made me more dependent on the Lord and the devotees. Through prayer, I realized the significance of our eternal prayer � the Holy Name. Recently I have begun trying to chant not only with clarity externally but with heartfelt shelter internally. As HH Bhakti Rasamrita Swami Maharaj often mentions, your two topmost instructions are:\n\n1. Always serve everyone in the mood of servant of the servant.\n2. Take complete shelter of the Holy Name with your whole heart.\n\nThese are the gifts you have given me through your vani.\n\nI pray at your lotus feet that I may follow your instructions exactly as you have given them, without compromise. Please remain with me always through your teachings and continue to guide me. Kindly forgive all my offenses to you and to your devotees. Thank you for transforming my life completely. Thank you for giving me shelter again and again.\nIn short � thank you for everything.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nSaurabh D"

You always desire to serve selflessly with a caring nature and never see bad in others, never criticize, and are always engaged in undivided devotional service with a simple and sober heart.\n\nDear Gurudev, you preach with your actions. What attracts people is not philosophy but the conduct of a person, and we all witnessed very well during KY 2025 how you respect even a child and how gracefully you reciprocated with your Godbrothers and Godsisters.\n\nDear Gurudev, your kindness and words of love are completely changing the hearts of people all over the world.\n\nDear Gurudev, you teach us how to love and serve Krishna, and before that, how to serve and deal with devotees. You always stressed upon how our dealings should be with our senior Vaishnavas and devotees. We must serve them with utmost sincerity and without any personal motives. This is the true essence of bhakti and the mission of Srila Prabhupada: how to remain united and have loving relationships and be helpful to each other.\n\nI heard from a devotee once an Indian chess player came to Gurudev and said, \"Swami ji, how did you become attracted to OUR Krishna\" Gurudev said to him, \"This white boy got checkmated by your black king of Vraja.\" So we see how gracefully and humorously Gurudev replied to him in his chess language, as he was a chess player.\n\nGurudev is so simple and humble. Even big leaders and industrialists take shelter and take guidance from him, but Gurudev always remains so humble and down-to-earth with no limelight. Rather, he gives limelight to his dear disciples when they do any little efforts in the mission of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nSo, on this very, very auspicious occasion of Maharaj's 75th Vyas Puja, I pray at his lotus feet to shower his mercy upon me and my family so that we can continue chanting 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra and follow all four regulations in principle and engage our lives in serving the mission of Lord Chaitanya and Srila Prabhupada without any ulterior motives.

On this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa-puja, we offer this small and heartfelt glorification from our family�Rama Mukunda Dasa, Radhika Lila Devi Dasi, Tulasi Gopika Devi Dasi and Tulasi. We pray that these few words may express even a drop of our gratitude for your mercy.\nGuru Maharaj, there is no joy in this world like the joy of seeing you and hearing from you in person. When you stand before us, something sacred fills the atmosphere. There is a sweetness, a purity, almost a magic in the air that cannot be explained. To receive your darshan in one�s own hometown, in one�s own temple, is a very special blessing from the Lordships. All of us in Seattle felt truly fortunate and deeply grateful when you kindly visited us from the 19th to the 22nd of May, 2025. Those days were filled with happiness as we watched you lovingly greet every devotee, blessing each person with your gentle smile and compassionate glance. Your presence brought so much warmth and encouragement; it felt as if mercy was flowing continuously.\nIn your presence, faith becomes natural, devotion becomes joyful, and the heart becomes soft. You are the reservoir of all that is sweet, gentle, humble, and pure. You accept everyone without judgment. You see the good in every soul, and not only see it�you magnify it. You are filled with gratitude for everything and everyone. Even though you are so exalted, your shyness, your innocence, and your simplicity remind us of a child, while at the same time, your determination, courage, and spiritual gravity are like a thunderbolt. You are a true sadhu. Though deeply austere and inwardly strong, you always depend solely on Krishna through prayer and surrender. You avoid taking service from others, yet you are always eager to serve. Your life has been an extraordinary journey�filled with freedom, adventure, pain, and joy�but through every season, you have only listened to the voice of Paramatma in your heart.\nYour compassion is vast and practical. Whether through Govardhan Ecovillage, Annakshetra, Barsana eye camps, or countless other efforts, you show what true spiritual love looks like. You never give importance to external designations like background, race, or religion. You simply see a soul�part and parcel of Krishna. You live only to fulfill Srila Prabhupada�s dreams and the mission of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. You unite hearts. You teach us to value relationships over achievements, people over projects, affection over ego. You never involve yourself in anything that could disturb the unity Srila Prabhupada desired in his movement. You only inspire cooperation, care, and mutual respect.\nYour hari-katha is the treasure of our lives. It has the power to purify and uplift the entire universe. For us, it is the source of our greatest joy. Even when you speak about tolerance, you never emphasize your own. Yet we have heard that your life has been filled with pain, and still you never allow it to touch others. Instead, you show only kindness. Your deep humility, your devotion to Gauranga Mahaprabhu, and your unwavering remembrance of Srila Prabhupada shine through every word and action.\nOn this sacred Vyasa-puja day, Guru Maharaj, we pray at your lotus feet for just one blessing�that every step we take, every word we speak, and every thought we allow into our mind may be guided by your gentle voice and your teachings. May we serve in a way that brings a little happiness to your heart and contributes, even in a small way, to the mission you hold so dear.\nWe offer our heartfelt prayers to Sri Sri Radha Neel-Madhava to kindly keep you always in the best health, filled with divine strength, and always in sweet remembrance of your beloved spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada. Thank you, Guru Maharaj, for your presence, your compassion, and your unconditional love.\nYour insignificant servants,\nRama Mukunda Dasa\nRadhika Lila Devi Dasi\nTulasi Gopika Devi Dasi\nTulasi"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nOn your 75th Vyasa Puja, I offer my heartfelt gratitude and best wishes. This is my first humble offering, and I pray to Sri Sri Radha Madanmohanji, Sriman Mahaprabhuji, and Sri Sri Lakshmi Narasimhadevji to bless you with continued strength and enthusiasm to serve Srila Prabhupada�s mission, while also nourishing us through your vapu and vani.\nI began listening to your lectures around 2016�2017. Your powerful reminder that �death may come at any moment� inspired me to take spiritual life seriously and seek Harinam initiation. By your mercy, you accepted me in 2017. Though I had been chanting since 2000, I later struggled to complete my rounds. After moving to the Bay Area in 2019, H.G. Sukhesvari Mataji connected me with H.G. Shankaranand Prabhu, whose association helped me resume steady chanting with joy.\nAs a child, I was never inclined to read beyond academics, but by your grace I developed a taste for Srila Prabhupada�s books. Reading with devotees brought me deep happiness. Later, I found similar nourishment through the Chant & Be Happy group under H.G. Shankaranand Prabhu. My brother, H.G. Anandarama Prabhu, sowed the seed of bhakti by giving me the maha-mantra, and H.G. Lilanand Prabhu�s classes on The Science of Self-Realization strengthened my conviction. I see all these devotees as your merciful instruments nurturing my spiritual growth.\nThis year, I immersed myself in your lectures, The Journey Home audio, and your glorifications by senior God-family members. Learning about your transcendental qualities has helped me face life�s challenges. During a difficult time in service, your lecture on compassion deeply moved me��We can�t love God if we dislike someone. We may not like what they do, but we must hate the disease and love the diseased.� Those words guided me to forgive and continue serving peacefully.\nIn recent years, I have gone through many personal challenges. When I briefly shared them during your visit to the Los Angeles temple, you listened kindly despite the crowd. Later, when you visited ISV, Mountain View, the whole God-family joyfully prepared to welcome you. My son Suraj and I felt immensely blessed to serve together during your visit and experience the joy your presence brings.\nRecently, a Godbrother advised me to seek a siksha guru for ongoing spiritual guidance. I humbly request, Guru Maharaj, that you kindly consider establishing the counselor system for disciples outside India, so that devotees like myself may receive regular support and accountability.\nI am currently torn between continuing my material education and dedicating more time to temple services and Bhakti Vaibhav study. Due to circumstances, I have chosen to continue studying but pray for the vision to see it as service to Krishna. With age and limited strength, I long to engage more directly in devotional service. I pray for your mercy to help me balance my responsibilities and dedicate all my efforts�spiritual and material�as offerings to you and the Lord.\nEarlier, I once felt saddened hearing that you give priority to Srila Prabhupada�s disciples and their disciples before your own. But now I understand that this reflects your deep humility and dedication to Srila Prabhupada. I am grateful for whatever mercy I receive, knowing it is far beyond my qualification.\nI hope to continue serving you�perhaps again through transcription�and eagerly await the upcoming yatra book. I pray that I may sincerely balance my Grihastha duties while deepening my spiritual life and, by your mercy, attain Sri Krishna�s lotus feet in this very lifetime."

You came to the hospital to see the 1-day-old baby, and you performed her naming ceremony too, later.\nYou graced the occasion of the 50th wedding anniversary of our parents and also the 75th birthday of Sahadev Prabhu.\nYou specially called up and spoke to my family when my father passed away.\nYou were there to bless Aradhita and Ravi at their wedding ceremony at Jaipur.\nYou have been there at every milestone of our Grahastha life, personally guiding us, showering us with immense love and care, just like a parent.\n\nMy heart is full of gratitude today.\nMaharaj, your magnetic presence, your magical touch does wonders.\nI just wish to share a small observation. My mother is suffering from Alzheimer's, and now there are times when we have to introduce ourselves to her, since her memory issues are giving her a lot of trouble.\n\nRecently, when Maharaj, you came to Jaipur to bless Aradhita and Ravi as they were taking their wedding vows, you met my mother, who was in a wheelchair.\nOn the wedding day too, you met her and had a long conversation with her, that I'm not aware of yet.\nBut the next day, as both of them were leaving, you met her again, and I was there too.\n\nMy mom's eyes lit up as she had your darshan. Her face became joyful, and she kept repeating, \"Radhanath Maharaj, Hare Krishna. Radhanath Maharaj, Hare Krishna. Radhanath Maharaj, Hare Krishna.\"\nMaharaj, you spoke to her and blessed her and then stepped down the stairs to leave.\nMy mother then said, \"Radhanath Maharaj, I want to....\" and she was struggling and fumbling to find words to express her desire when I noticed that she was trying to get up from her wheelchair and trying to touch your feet.\nI told Maharaj that 'she wants to touch your feet, Maharaj,' and Gurudev, you again stepped up on the parapet to allow my mother, who then bent down to touch your feet. You blessed her and prayed for her.\n\nMy throat was choked.\nFor a person whose brain cells are dying and whose memory has deserted her, the magic was that she associated the name of Radhanath Maharaj with the chant of Hare Krishna and recognized Maharaj and just kept hankering more and more for his association. This speaks volumes about the magic, the miracle in your presence, Maharaj.\n\nThe most important people in every child's life are his/her parents, and Maharaj, you have blessed my parents, my children, my entire family.\n\nMaharaj, please accept my prayers of gratitude today. I have always only taken and taken and taken from you, and again, I seek another favor from you, Maharaj.\nPlease pray for me so that I can slowly get more attached to serving the lotus feet of Krishna and be of service in fulfilling your desires and your vision. Let me be the most menial servant who can be used in any way that YOU desire."

You didn�t care about my qualifications. Just to please your godbrother, you accepted me under your shelter because he cares about me. You didn�t think if I would meet the standards your esteemed disciples have or whether I would be loyal to you and your teachings. You don�t see what we are, but just how by Krishna�s mercy, we can grow in our spiritual life and be a soldier in Chaitanya Mahaprabhu�s movement. I had always a desire to be a loyal soldier under this mission, and you kindly gave me my name, which resonated well with what I wanted to be. Who else can know my heart other than my beloved spiritual master\n\nGratitude -> Each and every word you speak reflects the depth of your gratitude�to your spiritual master, rla Prabhupda, to your godbrothers, and to every devotee who renders even the smallest service. By your example, you have taught us that gratitude is the foundation of love. You see Ka�s hand behind every circumstance and every person, and in doing so, you transform even suffering into sacred opportunity. In your presence, we learn that true gratitude is not spoken�it is lived. I still live by your teaching, that we should be grateful for every opportunity that we get to perform devotional service and in that mood render service. This one single teaching has been a turning point in my life on how I approach each and every service that comes my way. There is still a long way to perfectly harmonize this, but as long as I remain even minutely grateful to you, I know that I will succeed in my spiritual endeavors.\n\nHumility -> Your humility humbles us all. Though you are a leader with such a great following and have thousands of disciples and inspired a million others, you consider yourself the servant of everyone, a humble straw at their lotus feet, ready to render service to them. When I first approached you to take your shelter, you asked me, �How can I serve you� Who other than the most humble person can do that You emphasize always on *trinad api sunicena*, and your life is characterized by this. You see Krishna in everyone�s heart and thus you are ready to bow before even the youngest devotee, seeing in them the spark of Ka�s mercy. Your humility is not weakness�it is the strength that draws the Lord to your heart. By your example, we learn that the essence of leadership is service, performing even the most menial service in the most joyful way.\n\nYou have taught us that Bhakti is not just theory, but we have to cultivate it by being humble, being grateful, and being merciful to one and all. Thank you very much for being in my life.\n\nI once again offer my Dandavat prams at your lotus feet and pray that one day I can be qualified to be your disciple.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nHari Sankirtan Das."

I was thinking, \"\"Whatever spiritual service Maharaj is doing, he is doing it himself.\"\"\nSo how can Maharaj be credited with his guru, ril Prabhupada..\nMaharaj's words had such an impact on me that I thought about it for many days, but I didn't receive any answers back then. But today, 22 years later, I can confidently say that the entire credit for all the spiritual activities and services I have performed till today goes to you, my Guru Maharaj, Param Pujya Radhanath Swami Maharaj.\nGod's will is the Guru's will; God's qualities are the Guru's Vaishnavism. The Guru is the transparent medium who helps us reach God's qualities and makes us vaishnava.\nFor me, that transparent prayer is you, Maharaj.\nWhatever spiritual service I have performed , even if it is for my own purification, and whatever spiritual services I will perform in future, even if it is to express gratitude to the Guru Maharaj, the representative of God, the entire credit goes to you.I have no doubt about it today.\n I pray at the lotus feet of sri sri Radha  Madhava,Gauri Nitai ril Prabhupada and your feet on this auspicious occasion.\n\nI pray The ISKCON organization flourishes day after day.

Thank you for connecting me to the glorious parampar (Brahma-Madhva�Gaudiya Parampar) by accepting me as your disciple. Although I am not qualified, this is only because of your causeless mercy upon this fallen soul. I remember the countless struggles you underwent in your search for the ultimate path of perfection�how you came across HDG rla Prabhupda in Mumbai, then in Vndvana, and finally your search ended when you accepted HDG rla Prabhupda as your spiritual master. I am reminded of your pastimes described in Journey Home and in New Vrindavan, where you sacrificed so much�enduring severe cold, not having water to bathe, and sleeping hardly an hour�simply to please your spiritual master.\n\nI express my heartfelt gratitude to you, as I personally witnessed your magnanimity during this year�s Kartik Yatra 2025 at Govardhan. It is the result of your compassion, humility, countless sacrifices, and the inconveniences you take upon yourself to give Krishna to all of us.\n\nThis time I could understand why you always say in your lectures that one cannot go to Vndvana simply by purchasing a ticket. The most important thing is the consciousness with which we visit the holy places. You have shaped the consciousness of thousands of devotees before visiting sacred places through your nectarean kaths in the tent. In my whole life I had never heard Krishna�s pastimes described in such a way�as if you had personally witnessed them unfolding in Vndvana itself. Speaking continuously in the same posture without water, narrating Krishna�s ll in such depth�it felt as if I was hearing from Krishna�s confidential personal servant. Thank you very much for this Kartik Yatra, which I�and all devotees�eagerly await every year as the most spiritually nourishing days of the entire year.\n\nYou always emphasize in your lectures the quality of humility�trind api suncena�to always give respect to others and not expect respect from others. Although this principle seems very easy, it is actually the most difficult to practice in spiritual life. I personally tend to expect some appreciation from seniors for my service, or respect from juniors. Thank you very much for giving strong devotees like Radheshyam Prabhu and Gaurang Prabhu. Specifically, in my spiritual life, HG Radheshyam Prabhu�s contribution has been very important, along with the valuable guidance of my immediate superiors and counselors.\n\nAlthough my reading abilities may be limited, I am trying my best to read rla Prabhupda�s books daily. I beg you to kindly shower your blessings upon me so that I may develop even a small tinge of humility and genuine love for Krishna. I deeply appreciate your compassion and your dedication to following HDG rla Prabhupda�s instructions.\n\nUnder the guidance of senior devotees, I am dedicating my time to Krishna consciousness. I humbly seek your mercy to follow your teachings faithfully and to share your words with others. Please bless me with steady progress in my sdhana and services, and protect me from anarthas. I pray to r r Rdh Kunjabihari for your good health. Hare Krishna!!\n\nYour insignificant but fortunate servant,\nNitai Karunda Das"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nWishing you a very happy 75th Appearance Day!\nAs this is such a special milestone, the first and foremost thing I want to say is � �Thank you.�\nThank you for impacting my life in such a deep and transformative way. Thank you for touching the lives of my wife, my daughter, my parents, my sister, my brother-in-law, my sister-in-law, and so many other struggling jvas all over the world.\nIn rmad-Bhgavatam (8.7.44), there is a verse glorifying Lord iva:\ntapyante loka-tpena\n sdhava pryao jan\n paramrdhana tad dhi\n puruasykhiltmana\n�It is said that great personalities almost always accept voluntary suffering because of the suffering of people in general. This is considered the highest method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone�s heart.�\nWhenever I remember the story of how an Indian immigration officer once denied you entry, saying, �We already have enough beggars,� and how your response was so humble and full of compassion � that one day, you would do good for the people of India � I feel deeply moved. Despite immense hardships and personal inconvenience, you went on to establish so many wonderful projects for the welfare of society, such as free meal programs, the Barsana Eye Camp, Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Govardhan Ecovillage, and many more.\nLike Lord iva, you have prioritized relieving the suffering of others, even at the cost of your own comfort. At an age when most would prefer to rest and minimize travel, you continue to tirelessly travel the world to give your valuable association and share Krishna katha with everyone.\nOne special quality I want to highlight today is your unique way of sharing Krishna consciousness � much like r Nrada Muni. You can connect with people from all walks of life, from simple village ladies cooking rotis during ytras to highly educated IIT graduates. Your words carry a divine potency that can transform anyone�s life if they simply hear from you.\nIn rmad-Bhgavatam (11.26.26), it is stated:\ntato dusagam utsjya\n satsu sajjeta buddhimn\n santa evsya chindanti\n mano-vysagam uktibhi\n�An intelligent person should therefore reject all bad association and instead take up the association of saintly devotees, whose words cut off the excessive attachment of one�s mind.�\nYour words indeed cut through material attachment and awaken devotion.\nWhether speaking compassionately for hours with a humble watchman guarding the Salesforce tower or inspiring a chief executive of Barclays Bank in London � who, after hearing you for just 20 minutes, sold a $10 million property to the devotees for only $0.5 million � your presence and words can melt even the most astute and financially shrewd hearts. He said, �If this is how these Hare Krishna people are, give them the building.�\nJust as r Nrada Muni delivered Mgri the hunter, you have gone even further � delivering not only people involved in animal killing or material life but also extending compassion to animals and plants themselves. Through Govardhan Ecovillage, you have inspired the care and service of cows, bulls, sheep, donkeys, birds, chickens, and even thousands of plants � all connected to Krishna�s service.\nOn this most auspicious day, I once again thank you from the core of my heart and pray for your mercy � that I may serve the Vaiavas, Guru, and Krishna with even a fraction of the selflessness you have demonstrated all these years.\nI also pray to r r Rdh Madan Mohan to bless you with a long, healthy life and ever-increasing spiritual strength.\nYour servant,\nAcyuta Chaitanya Ds"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nOn this auspicious day of your 75th Vyas Puja, I would like to express my gratitude for appearing to us out of your causeless mercy to dispel the darkness of this material world through the instructions that emerge from your lotus mouth.\n\nI am extremely unqualified. I am totally unable to do anything by myself, and my heart is full of false ego. But due to the mercy of Vaishnavas and my inconceivable good fortune, I have surrendered myself to your lotus feet. Please destroy all the anarthas that I have accumulated since time immemorial. Please never ever allow me to forget that I do not have any independence anymore.\n\nI wish to serve you without any duplicity of heart. May my heart find satisfaction only in serving your desires. I beg for the strength to accept all the purification of the heart before I can become the genuine servant of your servants.\n\nYour instructions to have right consciousness while attending Yatra helped me a lot, like:\n1. Be absorbed in the spirit of service of all other devotees.\n2. Be absorbed in trying to take shelter of the holy names.\n3. At every moment, don�t let a breath escape from your body without Krishna's names.\n4. Be absorbed in hearing and chanting.\n5. Pray for pure devotional service wherever we may go.\n6. Pray for a humble heart devoid of ego.\n7. Pray to overcome lust, envy, anger, greed, and illusion.\n8. Selfishness is the enemy. Cure is to serve.\n\nThank you, Gurumaharaj, for taking all of us to such a divine place, Sri Govardhan Dham, for a seven-day stay, which I personally would have never imagined staying except for doing parikrama for a few hours.\n\nI am also really grateful for the last part of the daily class in the evening during this year's Yatra, where we had to call out to the Lord loudly with you. I personally felt that my spiritual master was asking Lord Sri Krishna to accept all his children who were helplessly calling out His holy names with purity.\n\nI have not been able to properly maintain what you so mercifully gave us. I may have also failed to express my love for you through my cooperation with other devotees. I beg for your forgiveness. Please always keep me engaged in the service of the Lord and His devotees with purity.\n\nYour eternally indebted daughter,\nShyamasundari Radhika Dasi\nKuwait"

It was the first time in my life when I felt that I should open myself towards spiritual personalities, and after searching many organizations, your video pushed me to search for this place named ISKCON, where compassionate personalities like you are, and also humorous like Gaur Gopal Prabhu. At the time when I first thought of the material world as a miserable place, you gave me hope. And later, I came in contact with Srila Prabhupada�s family in the mission of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nYou gave me a chance to be a part of Srila Prabhupada�s family, and now for 3 years, in our own shelter in the home of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath ji. It is the only place I know where I don�t see politics among devotees. There can be disagreements, but the cooperation is in the mood of servant of servant of servant.\n\nWhen I was studying the IDC course, I realized the position of a siksha guru, and that we are a siksha parampara. For the few years that I have been here, I have been experiencing your teachings through the devotees of Radha Gopinath Community. Their welcoming nature and treating all devotees as servant of servant.\n\nMany senior brahmacaris have given me so much love, which actually allowed me to push myself in devotion. And Maharaj, I really want to go deep in devotion, get rid of the envy I have in my heart. The grudges I hold for some devotees whom I have seen hurt devotees I love. And you are the personification of *Trinad api unicena* and my diksha guru, HH Lokanath Swami Maharaj, as *taror api sahisnuna*.\n\nWithout *Trinad api*, I will not be able to love and tolerate devotees and will keep on doing apradh against devotees.\n\nMy prayers are not sincerely coming from my heart, but I need your blessings, Maharaj, so that I can stay in this glorious community, in this family of Srila Prabhupada, for the entirety of my life in the mood of servant of servant.\n\nYour aspiring, insignificant servant,\nSyama Vamisidhar Das"

You serve the mission of Srila Prabhupada and the parampara with such intensity and purity. Whether speaking to thousands or serving quietly, you are always absorbed in Krsna�s mission. You have shown me that real service is not about visibility; it is about sincerity.\nGuru Maharaj, I am eternally grateful for your shelter. I pray to become a worthy disciple, to imbibe your mood, and to carry your teachings in my heart and actions. May I learn to serve with the same selflessness, to speak with compassion, and to walk with the humility that you exemplify.\nI am especially grateful for the inspiring Govardhan Yatra. It was a privilege to attend and associate with the God family and with you. The atmosphere was saturated with devotion, and your presence elevated every moment. I carry those memories in my heart, and they continue to nourish my spiritual life.\nThough I may not have the fortune to interact with you personally, I feel your shelter and care deeply through your teachings. In moments of confusion or challenges, your instructions guide me like a lighthouse in the storm. You are always present in your lectures, your books, and your example.\nOn this 75th Vyasa Puja day, I offer my life at your feet. Please bless me with the strength to follow your instructions, the sincerity to overcome my weaknesses, and the devotion to never forget your mercy.\nYour servant of the servant of the servant,\nSaci Rani Devi Dasi"

A true leader is one who can prepare many leaders. Your senior disciples are versatile in nature and leading Srila Prabhupada's mission very nicely. Last year, for the pleasure of Srila GopalKrishna Goswami Maharaja, you empowered all of us to come first in the Book Marathon. Your humility is melting millions of hearts.

This year on the \"Guru Kripa Bindu\" YouTube channel, old glorifications of devotees are being broadcast. It is really nourishing both body, mind, and soul.

Welcoming Gopa-kumra, Nryaa sighs anxiously, remarking that until then, how many lifetimes Gopa-kumra had spent without paying attention to Him. \"I was dancing like a fool,\" Nryaa, overwhelmed with love, addresses himself so, as He has been waiting lifetimes after lifetimes for Gopa-kumra. Couldn't He force Gopa-kumra No, the Lord never tries to change the nature of the little jva who seems to prefer bondage from time immemorial, or the nature of my who prefers to bind the jvas for so long too.\n\nGurudeva, this is the condition of this fallen, wretched servant of yours. It seems as though bahirmukhat�tendency to turn away from Ka�has become a part of me. Is there any sign of hope\n\nBut Bhagavn is an influencer. The next words Nryaa speaks in the same passage of r-bhad-bhgavatmta melts my heart in hope. Crying in joy, Nryaa says, \"You showed me no mercy, and as I considered this, I grew impatient, full of anxiety to receive your favor. So, I transgressed my eternal code of conduct and arranged for you to take your current birth. Dear boy, in that divine district of Govardhana, my most beloved abode, I myself became your guru, known by the name Jayanta.\"\n\nOutcome�finally Gopa-kumra basks in the loving embrace of Bhagavn.\n\nOn this day, remembering this heart-rendering exchange penned by rla Santana Goswmi, my dark heart palpitates with mixed feelings. Gratitude soars in the heart on one hand, that in order to resolve the impasse between my belligerence to remain turned away from Krishna and my's constant torment, Krishna has surely intervened by sending you�the embodiment of His energy and mercy�to take me out of this precarious situation. On the other hand, there is gloom in the heart, that when will I really understand the good fortune that has been bestowed causelessly�of being initiated and allowed shelter under the lotus feet of a perfect spiritual master in a bonafide lineage; of the most rare opportunity to follow in the footsteps of the eternal Vrajavs like yourself to reach the perfection of loving devotional service in the groves of r Vndvana as the servant of the servant of r Rdh.\n\nWith straw in my mouth, and kaha on my neck, I fall at your lotus feet today on the most auspicious day of your appearance. I know my deliverance would be predicated primarily on Krishna's mercy coming through you, still, as a fledgling soul with free will, I sincerely recommit to make your instructions the center stage of my life and to the best of my capacities endeavor to that effect, to make your will and not my ego the guiding light of my sojourn in this material world. And in this way, I pray to keep that hope burning, the hope which kept Gopa-kumra alive in his search for perfection.\n\nI pray to the cintmai dhma of r Vndvana and r Vndvanvar Rdh that they bestow the best of health to you, so that you may be here with us for long and long years, pleasing rla Prabhupda in leaps and leaps, engaging us in your service to him more and more.\n\nr Rdhe\n\nHarivaa Dsa"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna\nDearest Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my respectful obeisances.\n\nOn this auspicious day of your Vyas Puja, I wish to take a solemn vow to become a better devotee. Through your exemplary life and profound instructions, I have come to understand so many divine qualities that a sincere sadhaka should aspire to cultivate. These qualities not only please You, Srila Prabhupada, our Acharyas, and Krishna, but they also open the doors to the infinite grace and mercy that the Guru Parampara is constantly showering on us. Yet, due to my hard-heartedness and false ego, I often fail to taste or even desire that mercy.\n\nGuru Maharaj, you repeatedly emphasize the importance of humility. I must strive to be humble like a blade of grass�simple words, yet so challenging to live by. True humility is not feeling low or discouraged; it is the awakened realization of the Supreme Lord�s greatness and the exalted position of His devotees and my insignificance. Genuine humility will free me from envy and pride, allowing my heart to rejoice in and appreciate the wonderful qualities of devotees around me.\n\nAnother quality I deeply desire to cultivate is gratitude. You teach us that a grateful heart is like fertile soil in which the creeper of bhakti can grow strong and flourish. Real gratitude means sincere reciprocation�offering back everything I have received. Gratitude to the spiritual master is not limited to a yearly �thank you�; it means, �You have given me everything, and if I am truly grateful, I want to offer my entire life in return.� Guru Maharaj, I want to do whatever will please you. I want to dedicate every moment of my life to assisting you in serving Srila Prabhupada�s mission.\n\nYou also teach that sincere service attitude is essential for a sadhaka�s spiritual advancement. Through service�service to Krishna and to the great souls who have taken exclusive shelter of Krishna�I can develop genuine eagerness to hear about Him. The service attitude I cultivate becomes the very basis by which I can attract Krishna�s mercy. I pray to imbibe this true spirit of service, where no obstacle, excuse, or hesitation can impede my execution of Your Divine instructions.\n\nIn your recent lecture on Srila Prabhupada�s disappearance day during the Kartik Yatra at Govardhan, you explained that when a disciple sincerely follows the vani of his spiritual master, then the vapuh of the Guru manifests within the disciple�s heart. Such a disciple never feels separated from his Guru, not even for a moment. Guru Maharaj, I long to purify my heart so that I may truly invite you to reside there.\n\nI have a long journey ahead, yet I aspire to progress steadily on this path. Your love, shelter, and blessings are the anchor that will help me become receptive to the boundless mercy of our Acharyas and transform my heart, develop the love for Krsnas holy names, pastimes, his abode, his devotees and his seva.\n\nThank you is a small and insignificant word. Yet I offer this from the deepest cores of my heart. I feel immensely blessed and loved as I write this heartfelt offering. I pray that I never fail you and that you never give up on me.\n\nYour daughter,\nVrajabhumi Devi Dasi"

    "Your Offering": "75th Vyasa Puja - The Appearance Day of our Beloved Spiritual Master\nSrila Radhanath Swami Maharaj\n\nIn Srimad-Bhagavatam, in the Uddhava Gita (11.17.27: acaryam mam vijayinam), Krsna Himself declares that the acarya is non-different from Him.\n\nSrila Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakura also proclaims in his Gurv-astaka, �The spiritual master is to be honored as much as the Supreme Lord because he is the most confidential servitor of the Lord.\n\nThis is acknowledged in all revealed scriptures and followed by all authorities�. In the Padma Purana, Lord Siva tells Parvati �Of all types of worship, worship of Lord Vishnu is the best, and better than worship of Lord Vishnu is the worship of His devotee, the Vaishnava.\n\nOne who performs worship of Lord Govinda but fails to worship His devotee should be understood to be not a devotee of the Lord but simply a victim of false pride�.\n\nSo, we are doubly bound, by an injunction as well as a prohibition to celebrate this Most Blessed event, Sri Vyasa Puja. To further demonstrate by His own example, Lord Caitanya Himself instituted this auspicious celebration � Sri Vyasa Puja as chronicled in the Caitanya Bhagavata, Madhya Khanda Chapter 5. That inaugural Vyasa Puja happened in the year 1509 in Srivasa Aangan. �Srivasa Pandit, the head priest of the function, gave Lord Nityananda a flower garland to offer to a painting of Vyasadeva. Holding the garland in His beautiful lotus hand, Nityananda Prabhu hesitated and began glancing here and there as if He was looking for someone. Then to everyone�s surprise Nityananda offered the garland to Sri Caitanyadeva instead...�. Lord Gauranga is the guru of Sri Nityananda Prabhu. This is the basis of the worship performed by Lord Nityananda. Therefore, the worship of Vyasa-deva, is factually the worship of Lord Gauranga in the form of the present acarya.\n\nExpression churns and reinforces emotions. The celebration of Sri Vyasa Puja - The Most Blessed Event is an expression of the gratitude that a disciple feels for the spiritual master. And that gratitude is reaffirmed when a disciple expresses one�s own gratitude and hears other disciples� express their gratitude. During the course of our devotional life, Sri Vyasa Puja affords us an annual opportunity to set aside our mind�s wanderings on the trivialities that occupy our consciousness and single-pointedly bring our attention to the matchless gift, the causeless mercy that our spiritual master has brought into our lives and into the lives of those he has touched.\n\nIt is a special day to deeply contemplate how the spiritual master is acting personally in the lives of so many and how we/they are receiving his innumerable gifts and how we/they are acting in that prime relationship. It is a day to focus on his glories and not get caught up in our own insecurities, our inadequacies, failings.\n\nSrila Bhakti Vinod Thakura perfectly captures our condition and the indispensable and merciful role our spiritual master plays in our life. In one of his Saranagati Songs, Emona durmati, he writes �Oh Lord! Such a wicked mind has brought me into this world, but one of Your pure and elevated devotees has come to bring me out of it. He saw me so fallen and wretched, took pity, and came to me saying, O humbled soul, please listen to this good tiding, for it will gladden your heart.\n\nSri Krsna Caitanya has appeared in the land of Navadvipa to deliver you. He has safely conducted many miserable souls such as you across the sea of worldly existence. To fulfill the promise of the Vedas, the son of a brahmana bearing the name Mahaprabhu of golden complexion, has descended with His brother the avadhuta Nityananda. Together They have overwhelmed all of Nadia with divine ecstasy. Sri Caitanya, who is Krishna Himself, the son of Nanda, has saved the world by freely distributing His own holy name. Go also and receive your deliverance.�\n\nWe cannot go to Lord Caitanya directly and receive our means of deliverance but we can do so through our spiritual master, who is sevaka Bhagavan, the servitor God, who himself engages in the service of the Sevya Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya and is eager to re-connect the wandering soul with the Lord through devotional service. Sri Guru epitomizes who he represents. As a matter of fact, he follows the mandate of Lord Caitanya. In Caitanya Caritamrta, Lord Caitanya instructs �Instruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord r Krishna as they are given in the Bhagavad-gt and rmad-Bhgavatam. In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land.�\n\nHow does the spiritual master see Sri Vyasa Puja In one sense, it is one of the most difficult services for them. I have heard so from HH Srila Bhakti Caru Swami as well. There is also a very profoundly beautiful Vyasa Puja address to his disciples by Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakura in this connection. As we understand from Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur�s teachings, receiving worship and adulation is unnatural for the pure devotee Vaishnava spiritual master, as in his heart, he reserves that exclusively for his guru, other sadhus and Krsna. However, he receives such worship and adulation following the mandate of Krsna as we understood earlier. So, even this, as much as it goes against his nature, he receives it as a service unto the guru parampara, his Lord and his disciples. He remembers and meditates upon the mercy and love he himself has received from his guru and he sees how his guru and even his disciples are engaging him in service to Krsna. He remains humble and reaffirms his commitment to the guru parampara, his Lord and his disciples.\n\nThe spiritual master is not just a conveyer of Krsna�s will: he is the gateway to Krsna, he is the bearer of the descending mercy flowing from Krsna through the guru parampara and ushers it into our life and in return he also receives our devotional service in various ways and delivers it to Krsna up the parampara, the celebration of �his� Sri Vyasa puja being one of our services he delivers. So, if we understand this essential fact as to how he is the gateway to Krsna, how can we do anything but fall at his lotus feet and meditate upon his limitless glories.\n\nFinally, I want to share one example of the deep spiritual attachment a spiritual master has with his disciple(s) and vice versa. Srila Prabhupada had such an attachment for his disciples and his disciples have for him. Beyond the externalities of Sri Vyasa Puja, in many ways the event has the potency to re-kindle such a relationship.\n\nBy the mercy of the spiritual master is the mercy of Krishna accessed. So potent and transformational is the spiritual master�s mercy that the sincere disciple feels and remains indebted, lifetime after lifetime. The disciple strives to express that gratitude by dedicating one�s life to the spiritual master�s service.\n\nSo, Sri Vyasa Puja is a reminder for us as to why we are a part of this ISKCON movement, to prosecute pure devotional service and to share it with others.\n\nFinally, on this auspicious Sri Vyasa Puja day, let me offer my prostrated obeisances unto the divine lotus feet of HH Srila Radhanath Swami Guru Maharaja, who is a confidential associate of the Senapati Bhakta of Lord Caitanya�s army, Srila Prabhupada. I offer my obeisances to the devotees who commissioned me for this service for my own purification despite having many disqualifications to render this service. I seek the blessings of my god-brothers and god-sisters and their forgiveness as well if my words were inappropriate.\n\nYour insignificant servant of the servants\n- Batu Gopal Das\nAnd\n- Modini Gopi Devi Dasi\nHyderabad."

    "Your Offering": "Dearest Gurudeva\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at the dust of your lotus feet. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to you.\n\nOn the most glorious & special occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja day, I would like to humbly express my gratitude for accepting this fallen soul as your disciple. Your compassion is boundless and you are a reservoir of mercy. Although, many of your disciples have hardly got your personal association and specific instructions from you, and I being one amongst them, it is my conviction that inspite of not knowing me and many others personally, you are always caring and reciprocating with us by praying to the Lord for our spiritual upliftment. It's only due to your and the Vaishnavas' prayers and selfless love for us, that we make advancement in our attachment for the Lord. Else, what can I expect, being a fallen soul overwhelmed with anarthas. We understand from guru, sadhus, and sastra that the role of guru is that he gives Krsna to his disciples and if the disciple makes advancement in the form of his attachment towards guru, sadhus, sastra, and the Lord, then that is the success of guru's role. Your life is dedicated only to please Srila Prabhupada & Krsna and bring us closer to them in their service, as well as connect us to the caitya guru so we could receive guidance at the relevant time. In a letter, Srila Prabhupada writes to a disciple that the guru is present wherever a disciple wants him to be and since you aren't able to physically bestow your association, your prayers for us make all the necessary adjustments and arrangements so we could be steady in devotion to them and strive to please them.\n\nYour emphasis on reading Srila Prabhupada's books & executing the limbs of bhakti with faith shows how you are simply reiterating what Srila Prabhupada stated many times, quoting from the Svetasvatara Upanisad � that disciples can make progress only if they develop implicit faith in guru and Krsna simultaneously. Also, following Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur, you always emphasize the most essential aspects of bhakti, i.e., nama ruci, vaisnava seva, jiva daya & becoming dasanudas. Thus, one can see how expertly & loyally you pass down the message of our acharyas.\n\nHaving personally seen as well as heard about you from senior Vaishnavas, I understand that you are an extraordinary special associate of Srila Prabhupada meant to achieve extraordinary results. Whether it be sadhana wrt to all limbs of bhakti, relations & behavior with devotees (senior, equals & juniors) and people in general, qualities, sensitivity, being a guru & leader, strictness, practicality, services, austerity, all kinds of projects, etc., you have always demonstrated the highest level of example for all of us to follow. Your classes are outstanding & imbued with so much gratitude, absorption in the lilas, grounded in philosophy and humility, providing the essential commentaries of acharyas in such a lucid way that anyone can appreciate and relish it to one's heart's content. Your vani is truly an incredible source of inspiration for all of us. In order to give us this incredible nectar, I can only imagine how much effort, austerity & pain of love you go through. Whenever you interact with someone, it's filled with multiple lessons to be learned and reminds us of the example of achieving many targets simultaneously with one arrow. Only a Vaishnava of such a high caliber could manifest all these extraordinary qualities.\n\nYour glories are certainly unlimited, nonetheless, they keep expanding. I truly wish and pray to the Lord that with all my small & humble endeavors, I strive to please you more and more as time passes, but I need the strength to do this due to the many anarthas that I possess. Only by your causeless mercy, prayers, and kindness can I do this. I also pray with all my heart and sincere desire that your health remains good so that you could continue to bestow your physical association to all of us for many years to come in the service of Srila Prabhupada. Lastly, I would like to express that if by immense fortune, if I get a chance to serve your vapuh then I eagerly look forward to it. In any case, I always aspire to serve and please you & the devotees and strive to become dasanudas.\n\nYour insignificant servant trying to serve in separation,\n\nPrema Rasa Das (Chowpatty � Mumbai)"

Happy 75th appearance day, Maharaj.\nI consider myself very fortunate because I have got a chance to hear from you in this life. Because of your mercy, HG Radheshyam Prabhuji, HG Kanai Thakur Prabhuji, HG Aashray Gopal Prabhuji and Satyajit Prabhu and so many other devotees, I got the association of devotees. Currently, I am staying at a home away from home, i.e., in Ramanreti Vaisnava **under ISKCON BCEC, Pune**. I am assisting my superiors in some little services along with my studies. In this 5th semester of engineering, my counselor HG Aashray Gopal Prabhuji told me to make hearing a habit. So, I am regularly hearing your lectures at least for 15 minutes daily. Without hearing from you, I do not go to sleep. It is only the mercy of Krishna and you that I got inspiration to hear from self-realized souls like you.\nI like your lectures so much, especially those in which you narrate pastimes of the Lord and those in which you talk about Vaishnava Sadachar. Recently, I am hearing your lecture entitled \"Attention to details.\" In that, you told us that attention to the details is the sign of love. Also, you talked about free will. Our progress or downfall is always dependent on how we utilize our free will at every moment. Also, the lecture on the topic \"The Disease of Envy\" was so powerful for devotees in practicing KC. I have observed that you always stress the topic of controlling the mind and overcoming Anarthas in our hearts. I heard from you that when any devotee goes for preaching to non-devotees, the entire guru parampara is with him for support. This is very exciting for me. Also, you told me that accepting anxiety for the service of Krishna is a good thing.\nMaharaj, your each and every sentence is like a bullet that pierces my heart to purify it. Thank you so much, Maharaj.\nRecently, I read \"The Journey Home.\" I was shocked by seeing your efforts and austerity for knowing Krishna. Anyone can be inspired by reading this adventurous journey. I got very powerful lessons from it. By reading your journey, I have got the conviction that You are Krishna's representative only. I pray to the Lord that may I hear from you regularly and always stay in the association of devotees.\nYour Aspiring Servant,\nPrasad"

I am a very unfortunate fallen soul who, by the association and help of your loyal disciples and aspiring disciples, has got a chance to write to you on the most auspicious occasion of your divine appearance day. I only pray that you keep bestowing the mercy of your words and glance on fallen souls like me, because without the mercy of Mhbhgvats like you, life is useless and dry.\n\nAs you are very, very dear to your most glorious spiritual master, Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedant Swami Srila Prabhupada and Lordships, Sri Sri Rdh Gopnth, you are worshipable to us first and foremost. You guide us to serve them with humility and purity.\n\nDue to my sinful condition, I haven't met you or seen you in person. I do, however, take this as a sign that Lord Krishna is giving me time to prepare myself to get your association. I've heard from devotees that the Lord gives separation, which in turn increases love towards Him. The same follows for His beloved devotees, such as you. You are truly a gem given to us by Srila Prabhupada and Lord Chaitanya.\n\nI would like to tell you that I've been taking guidance from a few of your disciples for some time. As a result, I've started to aspire to be your disciple just because of the pure devotee association of your sincere disciples. Your disciple, HG Sharanya Radha Devi Dasi, is an exceptional devotee. Talking to her really eases the doubts in one's heart; she wonderfully radiates your warmth and divinity. Your disciples really love you with all their hearts, and they always talk about you with so much adoration and gratitude. This wonderful bhv of theirs really inspired me. I promise to sincerely take their guidance and become capable to serve you.\n\nI would also like to tell you that I've been reading your autobiography, \"The Journey Home,\" which describes your transcendental life adventures in your own divine words. Reading the first few chapters has made me realize that Lord Krishna has really been biased about loving you. The strange and mysterious ways that He brought you to Srila Prabhupada after such a long journey throughout so many countries are truly wonderful! My parents have also been awestruck with your pastimes; it's really so wonderful that you decided to share these glorious pastimes to the world through your book.\n\nI would also like to pay my obeisances to the times when you read Srila Prabhupada's purports in your lectures. The way you say his divine name with so much affection and care is very, very heartwarming. It makes us, the listeners, relish Srila Prabhupada's, as well as your, words. Thank you for always showing us such a beautiful bhv towards your Gurudev, Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedant Swami Srila Prabhupada.\n\nI deeply apologize, Maharaj. I am very ignorant, and I do not know much about your greatness. I'm barely able to glorify you due to me being so fallen. Please have mercy on me, and I sincerely pray to my home Deities, to Srila Prabhupada, and to Sri Sri Rdh Gopnth that this letter makes you smile. I sincerely hope so.\n\nPlease be merciful towards me; please forgive the mistakes that I have committed while writing this letter, may it be words or in thoughts.\n\nOnce again, I wish you a very wonderful Vyas Puja this year and for the upcoming many years.\n\nI again beg you to accept my humblest obeisances.\n\nYour Fallen Servant,\nDivya Patil\nDamodardesh, Dubai, UAE."

It is only through your immense, unconditional mercy that I am getting the association of so many exalted devotees, which is helping me improve day by day in my spiritual life.

This has helped me to read these scriptures, and I feel so amazed that earlier in my life, I was trying to understand scriptures with no sanga. It was so futile. I kept reading without any understanding, but since the time I came into sanga, reading scriptures has been accompanied by realizations in life.

After reaching the destination, you went aside for some time. When the devotees came to check on you, they found that you were removing thorns from your feet. Your feet were bleeding, yet you had walked ahead to clear the path so that no devotee would be hurt.\n\nJust as the spiritual master removes the darkness of ignorance with the torchlight of knowledge, you removed the obstacles�symbolized by those thorns�from the path of your disciples through your personal care and love.\n\nWhen our marriage was fixed, we went to invite you. On the same day, there was the annual function of Bhaktivedanta Hospital, so you kindly said that you would not be able to attend but that your heart would be there. Later, during the Pune Yatra in January 2001, you saw my wife and inquired warmly, �How was the function on 7th January� You remembered the date and asked lovingly about our well-being. That care for even small details deeply touched our hearts.\n\nWhen you instructed us to move back to Mira Road, you personally informed some senior disciples to help us settle there. By your arrangement, they assisted us with the purchase of our flat and loan procedures. Krishna Chandra Prabhu even came to our home to inspect every room and corner to ensure everything was proper. This reflected your immense personal concern for your disciples� comfort.\n\nRecently, during the Govardhan Yatra, you visited the kitchen and personally thanked the devotees for their seva. You always appreciate devotees, no matter how small their service may be. During the Govardhan Puja Abhishek, when Advaita Krishna Prabhu had the service of holding Giriraj Shila, later that day you embraced him and humorously said, �So, you were holding Giriraj like Pulastya Muni,� bringing smiles to everyone present.\n\nAgain, during the celebration at Rameshchandra Goswami Ji�s house, you displayed the same humility and gratitude. When Advaita Krishna Prabhu helped you climb the stage by holding your hand, you turned around and personally thanked him. This shows how you value and appreciate even the smallest acts of service by devotees.\n\nFrom your book *Journey Home*, we have learned how you always prioritize keeping others happy�even at the cost of your own comfort. At Ramsevak Ashram, you were once served spicy khichdi twice, yet without any complaint you honored it for the pleasure of the sadhu who served you. This reveals your deep compassion and tolerance.\n\nWe have no qualification to offer prayers, yet we humbly pray at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Govindji for your good health and long life.\nPlease bless us to always remain under your divine shelter.\n\nYour aspiring servants,\n\nSubalgopal Das\nVilasmanjari Devi Dasi\nNandkishore\nSanatan"

You are shaping communities all over the world and in that way you are shaping the entire world so that we all can be aligned to serve and please Srila Prabhupada in a sustainable way. Your emphasis on:\n\t1. Care, ensures that we sustain to serve Srila Prabhupada, or else we will lose inspiration to serve.\n\t2. Purity and high character, ensures that we are effective instruments in Srila Prabhupada's mission, or else we will be discouraged.\n\t3. Sincerity of purpose, ensures that we grow through innumerable obstacles on this path, or else we will lose focus, be distracted & lost in worldly pursuits.\n\nThank you Gurudev, for giving us so much shelter through your loving disciples - HG Radheshyam Prabhuji and HG Acharya Ratna Prabhuji. They are always encouraging and inspiring me to serve you in so many practical ways. By their mercy I am engaged in youth preaching, a service very dear to you. I am humbly seeking your mercy, so that I may be able to spread your message to many youths and bring them to take shelter of Srila Prabhupada in his birthplace, Sri Kolkata Dham.\n\nThank you Gurudev, for giving us your heart and allowing us to serve you intimately in your heart. In 2019, after having a meeting with you along with Dayaram P and the temple council on building a gorgeous temple in Kolkata, you told us - \"I am giving you my heart. My heart is what Srila Prabhupada wants. Srila Prabhupada wants a gorgeous temple in Kolkata.\" By giving us this mission, you have allowed us to stay in your heart. Although it�s not easy to continue, but on your last visit to ISKCON Newtown, Kolkata temple you told that - \"let us try.\" So, by your mercy, we are all trying. We know that because of your desire and Srila Prabhupada's desire, everything wonderful is sure to happen here; we just pray that may we be pleasing instruments in your hands.\n\nAlthough now in Brahmachari ashram for more than 15 years, still I have been very seriously lacking to follow the simple basic principles of a devotee's life. I beg to you for spiritual strength, so that I may very strictly follow the 4 regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds very attentively, study Srila Prabhupada's books daily & scrutinizingly, hear your lectures every day and serve in the mission of Srila Prabhupada in the mood of a humble servant of the servant of the servant. This includes so many more things I wish to beg. Let me be a devotee as you want me to be. That�s all.\n\nYogyata vichare kichu nahi paye tumara karuna sara\nKaruna na hoile kandiya kandiya prana na rakhibo ara\n\nGurudev!

We are so grateful to you for giving us this opportunity to glorify our beloved Gurudev for his pleasure, and at the same time, to reflect on your teachings, to learn from them, and to become a good servant.\n\nWith your mercy and the mercy of Srila Prabhupada, I have completed five years in the association of Prabhupada�s ISKCON family. For a distracted and insincere soul like me, this could only be possible because of the constant support, guidance, and gentle taming from your wonderful disciples and aspiring disciples. I am forever indebted to them.\n\nBy the end of this November, Gurudev, I will also be completing three years of chanting 16 rounds. In these three years, I must have missed the daily minimum for approximately four to five days, but I covered them the next days. Still, I must be honest with you, Gurudev � the quality of my chanting is very poor. Most of the time, it is multitasking and mechanical.\nBut today, through this offering, I promise to improve my chanting, and in the next Vyasa-puja offering, I will surely submit a positive report.\n\nRegarding hearing and reading Srila Prabhupada�s books, I have been inconsistent � sometimes due to lack of time, but mostly due to excuses. I sincerely look forward to improving in this area as well.\n\nFrom the lectures of Srila Prabhupada, your Godbrothers, yourself, and your disciples, I have learned that the holy name of Krishna is greater than Krishna Himself, because when Krishna is upset with us, His holy name can save us. But even greater than the holy name is the mercy of one�s Guru, because if even the holy name is displeased with us, only the Guru can save us. Guru is the representative and the most beloved of Krishna.\nAnd if Guru is upset, then the jva is truly hopeless.\n\nGuru Maharaj, all my actions are upsetting. I have not been doing well in either material or spiritual life. I am insincere, inconsistent, and careless � but my only hope is you. Please, Gurudev, do not be upset with me. I promise to become a good servant and, someday, a humble and sincere devotee.\nPlease save me, Gurudev.\n\nGurudev, through your actions you exemplify how a devotee � and even more, how a disciple � should act. As you are my only hope, I have written a small song for you. I initially planned to offer it personally at your lotus feet, but please accept it through this medium. I pray to Krishna to grant me even one opportunity to sing it personally before you someday. \n\n\n---\n\n �OH! GURUDEV� \n\n*An offering at the lotus feet of HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj\n\nby your most insignificant aspiring servant, Astitva*\n\n\n---\n\nDrowning in the ocean of nescience,\nHad no hope, then you came in my life,\nDarkness was pervading in my mind,\nYou burnt yourself to give me all light.\n\nFrom the street of West to Himalayan feet,\nYou came out of mercy to deliver me,\nLost in material world, I was lurking around,\nDidn�t find no peace, I was looking all wrong.\n\nOh Gurudev� Oh Gurudev� ami tomar kukur! Gurudev\nOh Gurudev� Oh Gurudev� ami tomar kukur! Gurudev\n\nWorking round the clock for Prabhupada�s pleasure,\nHumility so high, and no time for leisure,\nEmbodiment of love and Srila Prabhupada�s mercy,\nBuilding GEV and divine communities.\n\n�krishna se tomara, krishna dite paro,\ntomara sakati ache\nami to� kangala, �krishna� �krishna� boli�,\ndhai tava pache pache.�\n\nOhh Gurudev� Ohh Gurudev� ami tomar kukur! Gurudev\nOhh Gurudev� Ohh Gurudev� ami tomar kukur! Gurudev\n\n\n---\n\nI hope you liked it, Gurudev. The song is composed, but it is not possible to share the audio through this medium.\n\nThank you, Gurudev, for everything you have given us, and for all that we are yet to realise. We are eternally indebted for your causeless mercy. I will surely work upon everything I have promised, Gurudev.\n\nThank you so much, Gurudev.\nHare Krishna.\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\nYour most insignificant aspiring servant,\nAstitva"

Your instructions of genuine humility, compassion, servitude, and prayerful mood, heard in your lectures and personified by you, have added the real essence to my consciousness, making it at least worthy of being offered to Krishna.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, please overlook the countless flaws in this fallen soul and accept me in the service of your lotus feet, the way you wish to.\n\nMy sincere prayerful desire presented at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Madhav through a sincere devotee��\n\n�Still your mercy flows, O RadhaGopinath,\nIn the form of my Master, Swami Radhanath.\nFor he is the soul so divine and pure,\nA beautiful flower of your garland for sure.\n\nHe is the hope for this hopeless soul;\nTo follow his footprints is the purpose sole.\nPlease do fulfill this desire, O� Master of my Master,\nTo surrender to him submissively, as his sincere disciple.�"

A happiest 75th Vyas Puja Maharaja!\nDear Guru Maharaja, as I sit to write down this year's Vyas Puja offering for the pleasure of Your Holiness, I'm overwhelmed with the countless memories, reciprocations, and blessings that you've showered in my life. As I look back, I find that you were always there, arranging the situations in the best possible way to develop my Krishna Consciousness.\nYou have been the embodiment of Guru Nishtha throughout your life through your body, mind, and words.

Your glories are unlimited, oh dear Gurudev!\nIf I talk about me, you have nonetheless picked me up from a random pit of dirt and abominable things and placed me in the care of HG Raghu Nath Das Prabhu and HG Raspriya Mataji. I can see my prayers have been answered�might or might not be by Krishna, but definitely by you, Gurudev.

Similarly, only if you mercifully give me your shelter can I serve rightly. What can I do to make your Appearance Day special from my side The only thing I realized which pleases you most is when you see Srila Prabhupada's movement spreading throughout.\nI am in need of your blessings, Guru Maharaja, to serve efficiently in this lifetime. As I always pray, please always engage me in your service through my Shiksha Gurus, under their guidance. Only by the service opportunities they have provided me with have I gained the chance to write this Vyas puja offering.

I don't deserve any of them.\n\n1. You have given me many gem-like Vaisnavas who are very ideal and inspiring in bhakti.\n2. Under your guidance through HG RSP, we got voice centers where we got training in bhakti.\n3. I got to see what surrender is by seeing your surrender.\n4. By hearing your lectures regularly, I get so much strength and conviction to practice bhakti.\n5. You taught me how to be grateful, show respect, and aspire to be a menial servant of servants.\n6. You taught me always to be conscious of Krishna and depend on Krishna.\n7. You taught me how to chant holy names.\n8. You taught me how to face difficulties depending on Krishna and consciousness and attitude during those difficult times.\n9. You taught me what is love.\n10. You taught me what is Guru bhakti.\n11. You taught me how a disciple should be.\n12. You taught me how to love God, brother.\n13. You taught me how to honor prasadam.\n\nLike this, you have taught me so many things. Gurudev, I am trying my best to follow all these, but I am nowhere near to all of these expectations. Please bless me, Gurudev, that I may at least come a little closer to your expectations.\n\nGurudev, by all of your mercy and the Lord's mercy, I got a partner who is helping me in all of my activities. I had so much fear about what type of partner I would get. Before marriage, I prayed to Narasimha and did puja to give me a good partner. My wife is a very good support to my bhakti. She is chaste and loving. She also is trying to follow the process, but she is not consistent. I hope she will become consistent. Till now, we couldn't take much association, but this year I am planning to shift either to Hyderabad or Vijayawada. HG RSP guided and suggested coming to Hyderabad. I also want to come but am now sure what is your and Krishna's will. I was also busy in writing books; now I have completed that. Now I want to focus more on bhakti but am not sure how to go ahead. Seeking your guidance regarding this, Gurudev. I will also take guidance from superiors regarding this. Gurudev, I also acquired my money back in the form of land after some struggle with my father. Like this, there are so many things, Gurudev, that I wish to share with you. By your mercy, Srila Prabhupada's mercy, and the Lord's mercy, I could overcome all obstacles on my spiritual life.\n\nI pray at your lotus feet that please bless me that my dormant faith gets strengthened, get strength to practice the limbs of bhakti, and never offend any living entity, as everyone is a servant of Gaura Chandra. I can die anytime. Wherever I may take birth, please bless me that I get the association of Vaisnavas who will guide me and engage me in the service of the Lord and Vaisnavas. And as long as I am alive, let me be fully engaged in the service of Hari, guru, and Vaisnavas. Life after life, let me only aspire for pure devotion.\n\n \nBefore marriage, I didn't know what bhakti is. I just used to visit the temple, but after marriage, I got some interest in bhakti. I am trying to go deep into bhakti, but somehow not able to go deep, and I am not getting that much taste. But just by doing a little bhakti, I am able to see a change in my heart. Wherever I offer bhoga to the Lord, I feel some happiness. I am trying to be consistent in bhakti, but somehow I am not able to make it. My husband also helps me in devotion. He also tries to explain what bhakti is. I also have a desire to get a great Vaisnava child, but at the same time, I don't think I am qualified to ask Krishna for this desire. Krishna knows what I want, and let Krishna only decide what he wants to give, and I will not demand him. I don't know what is right or wrong, just writing whatever is in my heart. We are just depending on him to guide us.\n\nMaharaj, I want to develop love for Krishna, practice bhakti, but somehow not able to do that. I pray that Lord Krishna and you help me to advance in bhakti. Please bless that both of us and our family will eventually take up the mission of preaching and advance in bhakti. And also, let us not desire anything other than pure devotion. We seek your blessing that whatever difficulties we may face, but we never forget Krishna.\n\nIn your service,\nNavasairam, Laxmi Roja"

The instructions that come to my mind today are as follows:\n\n**Live without pretending.** This instruction displays your quality of Honesty. You honestly admit that you can�t do management, even though you are very good at it. You consider yourself a grass-roots person. On this point, I remember a lecture where Srila Prabhupad once said honestly that he wasn�t sure whether taking sannyas was a wrong decision. This is because, in the initial years, he faced a lot of challenges. But Prabhupad said that he knew that Krsna would look after him.\n\n**Hear without pretending.** This instruction displays your quality of Humility. Once, after your Bhagavatam class, someone challenged your explanation. You quietly listened to his challenge and accepted it, even though your explanation was in line with Prabhupad�s explanation. When asked about your behavior, you said that you didn�t want to challenge your seniors.\n\n**Speak without offending.** This instruction displays your quality of Sensitivity. You are very careful about the words that you choose. Once, a few devotees complained to you about a mataji�s frivolous behavior. You immediately corrected the word to be �over-friendly�. In another instance, one brahmachari was being a hypocrite with his behavior. Even though you knew about this, you changed the description to being �unqualified for Brahmacharya�. You didn�t want to use heavy words like �frivolous� and �hypocrite� because you wanted to send the message without offending.\n\n**Love without expecting.** This instruction displays your quality of Compassion. HG Gurudas Prabhu once said that you are the most non-compromising, open-minded person he has ever met. In one instance, you spent three full days talking to your god-brothers, who had left ISKCON. But you wanted to give them compassion and still feel connected to Prabhupad and Krsna. I have also personally experienced your compassion through the behavior of your senior disciples like HG Shubha Vilas Prabhu, HG Muralidhar Prabhu, and HG Radha Rani Mataji, with me and my family.\n\nI lack these qualities. But, going ahead, I will strive sincerely to follow these instructions. As every day passes, I genuinely feel unqualified to have received your mercy. However, I always pray to the Lord to give me intelligence such that my actions, words, and behavior give justice to the compassion that you showered by accepting me as your disciple.\n\nI sincerely request you to keep me under the cool shade of your mercy and compassion because without your blessings, I have no identity. As Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur says:\n\njogyata-vicare, kichu nahi pai,\ntomara karuna�sara\nkaruna na hoile, kandiya kandiya,\nprana na rakhibo ara\n\nYour eternal servant,\nVraja Bhava Das"

My prabhuji were jobless, suddenly. It was a too difficult time. We were serving Shri Jaganathji, Baldevji, and Subhadra Mai at home; the kids were small; their school, rented house... so many things! Two months went by like this. I heard in classes, read in books, \"no prayer for material things,\" so I never did the same.\n\nBut one day, when I received the result of my unsuccessful attempt at a competitive exam, I was totally disappointed and literally crying in front of Shri Jagannath Ji, not asking for anything, but crying. That night while sleeping, I prayed to you and asked for forgiveness for crying in front of Lord Krishna and requested you to please give me strength to tolerate the situation and please suggest me how I can overcome the situation. Please give me a ray of hope! And I slept. When I woke up in brahma muhurta, doing regular activities before starting japa, I prayed to you. Suddenly, one thought struck me: \"Why am I searching for a job Why not start our own coaching classes\" as I am a lecturer in college. With that thought, I completed my japa and shared this thought with my family. Everyone felt, \"How can you start it We don't have anything.\" But because of your mercy, we got help and started our own Bhaktivedanta classes for Class 5th to 10th, and 25 students joined our class within a month. My prabhuji and I both were teaching in the class.\n\nIt's all your mercy, Guru Maharaj!\nI can able to realize your presence in our life and surroundings. Devotees said that females can't serve Guru Maharaj, but your vanni seva is everything for us, Guru Maharaj!\n\nPlease, please, Guru Maharaj, keep us in your seva and under your shelter always!\nBless us with dasanu das bhav to continue to serve you and your devotees in Srila Prabhupada's mission!"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Guru Maharaja\nPlease accept my humble obeisances\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada\nAll glories to Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga\n\nMaharaja we wanted to express words of gratitude on this 75th Vyasa Puja of yours. It has been 14 years since we came to know about you. I was in my first year and I was introduced to your visit to Kolkata during Nityananda Trayodasi - unfortunately, I didn't turn up for that event. Shortly after this I read \"The Journey Home\" and I was spellbound by the book, especially how Krishna intervened at every crucial juncture of your life Maharaja - dog biting when the visa was over, Hare Krishna mahamantra being revealed to you by Mother Ganges etc. I was specially inspired to serve in Kolkata because you had said in one lecture that half of your life lies in Kolkata. The more I got to know about you, the more I was amazed, enthralled, fascinated and inspired by your life, some of which I am going to share today.\n\nWe see you as an epitome of Vaisnava relationships - how you glorify every Srila Prabhupada disciple - so many instances we heard you showering praise on Srila Prabhupada disciples with regard to what services they carried out for Srila Prabhupada. In fact, we know about so many Srila Prabhupada disciples by your exclusive lectures on them. I was especially very inspired by your association with HH Bhakti Tirtha Swami Maharaja - how you cared for Maharaja, had such a deep, loving bond of friendship and what are the depths of spiritual friendship. Once when a guest came to Chowpatty late in the night, you requested HH Chandramauli Maharaja to vacate his room and shift to the brahmacari asrama (because there was no other way a room can be arranged at such a short notice); next day in Mangal Arati you were apologizing to him for the inconvenience caused.\n\nIn your lectures, we find many instructions which are very crucial for our growth, progress and safety in Krishna consciousness. I remember when we just landed up in the association of devotees, many things were very difficult for us to compile, understand and maneuver through. That time we found a lot of shelter in your lectures, Maharaja - we remember listening to some of the lectures around 10-15 times!!! All those lectures helped us go beyond the various crises and struggles in our Krishna consciousness. And the reason your lectures contain such depth, meaning and substance to deal with challenges, I understood when I heard the lecture series entitled \"My Life at New Vrindavan\" and another lecture by HH Bhakti Vijnana Goswami Maharaja. Despite so many hardships in New Vrindavan, especially when everyone was following a complex tradition, you never gave up your commitment and chastity to Srila Prabhupada. HH Bhakti Vijnana Goswami Maharaja told that you asked him to continue staying in Russia that time because you had stayed back in New Vrindavan, the sole reason being the fact that devotees can have someone to take shelter of. Even in such an environment, you never criticized, complained and offended anyone and carried on with your services. And such incredible tapasya!!! Infathomable!!! When one devotee didn't care for you when you fell down from the pony, you never had grudges against that devotee - this is very, very difficult. That holds true for much of your stay in New Vrindavan. When all your preaching projects in USA were stopped, it must have hurt you - but you never complained. I once heard that you kept records of various ups and downs in New Vrindavan, not because of fault-finding, but because you wanted to keep a record of what not to do in a temple - all those things were incredibly taken care of when you took up and grew ISKCON Chowpatty. When we hear about HG Radheshyam Prabhu, HG Gauranga Prabhu, HG Shyamananda Prabhu, HG Radha Gopinath Prabhu and HG Vrindavan Prabhu regarding the initial days in Chowpatty, we are amazed how you transformed the temple by your example, purity and instructions. When they share about their questions they posed to you and what amazing answers you gave, it's just out of the box; rooted in deep, KC philosophy and practical to the highest degree. Some of them are as follows:\n1) We never thought we are qualified enough to get the personal association of Srila Prabhupada.\n2) Q - Who should we allow to sing in the temple Ans - If the devotee is very advanced, we should give him singing for the Deities even if he is not such a good singer. But if there are new people around...\n3) Q - How can I know in a particular situation whether I am following what you want me to follow and you are not around for guidance Ans - If you sincerely follow what I have told you to follow, then Krishna will inspire you to do what I want you to do when I am not available for guidance.\n4) Q - How to tolerate devotees Ans - Just tolerate them the way I am tolerating you.\n5) We should honestly avoid the association of the opposite sex.\n6) Q - What to do when we know that some devotee is treading wrong trajectories and his downfall is certain Ans - We should have some means to ensure that he stops doing that. If he is not listening, we can just leave them, and whatever has to happen will happen to them.\n7) Look at any situation from three levels: how it affects the individual devotee, how it affects the society of devotees, and how it impacts the outside people. Then make appropriate decisions.\n8) Q - How do you have so many loving relationships despite having differences of opinion Ans - I focus on the similarities and do not focus on the differences.\n9) Even if we struggle, foam in the mouth, undergo hardships, to bring just a smile on the face of Vaisnavas, we should happily do it.\n10) If you don't have something to die for, there's nothing you can live for.\nEspecially your example - when we are in any confusion, especially when it seems that we are about to shout at devotees, then we remember what would you have done in such a situation. That completely removes the fog of confusion and dispels all our doubts and gives us the strength to do what is right. In the 13th Chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna tells about the 18 items of knowledge - there He mentions that one who knows this knowledge will never be bound. This is very distinctly visible in your life.\n\nYour philosophical understanding is amazing. In one of your question and answer sessions during the early days of Chowpatty, you had mentioned that just by our efforts we cannot chant the Holy Names of the Lord. We need the mercy and blessings of Vaisnavas, and we acquire that by serving the devotees, doing Vaisnava seva. This integral aspect of devotional service was not my focus for a long period of time. But when I followed this instruction of yours, to acquire blessings, I found that not only chanting improved but many obstacles I was able to fight. That's when I had a slight understanding of the import of being the servant of the servant of the servant.\n\nYou are so caring and accommodating. Once when one devotee was contemplating drowning in the Arabian Sea (and he didn't tell you), you came from your room, straight to him, whispered in his ear just the words \"I need you\", and went back. This left the devotee spellbound and he happily reverted his decision. You were there for HG Stoka Krishna Prabhu when he needed you the most.\n\nPresently I am serving in Kharagpur. We are engaged in preaching to the first years under the guidance of HG Mukund Lila Prabhu. Also, we are trying to carry out research in the field of consciousness and trying to glorify Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam.\n\nWe pray at your lotus feet for strength in performing our devotional service - to carry them out with the highest principles of integrity, in the mood of being servant of servant of servant, with loyalty and chastity to the teachings of Srila Prabhupada and with the mood to assist Srila Prabhupada's disciples. We also pray at your lotus feet to protect us, guide us, chastise us, whatever it takes to keep us going strong on the path of Krishna consciousness - let all material and separatist desires get vanquished by your instructions, and we assist Srila Prabhupada and his exalted followers in this mission. Kindly give us strength that we may follow in the footsteps of your exalted followers.\n\nThank you so much Maharaja for everything you have given us. Please give us strength so that we take up more services as we go ahead.\n\nYour lowly, insignificant servant\nHarshit"

By the mercy of both Krishna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.\"\n\nI have been extremely fortunate to attain the shelter of a bona fide spiritual master such as yourself after wandering in the material world for countless lifetimes, forgetting my service to Krsna.\nBut just as pearls thrown before swine cannot appreciate their value, similarly, due to so many conditionings accumulated over countless lifetimes, I am unable to fully take advantage of the most auspicious position of being engaged as a servant that has been offered to me.\nStill, due to association of devotees who are representing teachings of Srila Prabhupada and yourself, and especially hearing your spiritual potent vni is keeping me engaged in devotional service.\nMaharaj, Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur prays in one of his bhajans,\nkndiy kndiy jniba dukha-grma |\nsasra-anala haite mgiba virma ||\nuniy mra dukha vaiava hkura |\nm� lgi� ke vedibena pracura ||\nvaiavera vedane Krishna daymaya |\ne hena pmara prati ha�bena sa-daya ||\n\nAlthough it's very difficult to come to such a state of conclusion regarding material existence as mentioned here by Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur - because of so many artificial and useless hopes still lingering in my heart - by hearing your potent spiritual sound vibrations, some understanding of this situation has been awakened. And I understand that the only remedy to come out of this and be engaged as a servant of menial servants of the Divine Couple and Their servants is the request of pure devotees like you on our behalf to Srimati Radharani - the pleasure potency of Lord Krishna.\nThis same conclusion you expressed in a recent lecture at Sri Govardhan Dham Kartik yatra regarding the story of Indra taking shelter of mother Surabhi.\nMaharaj, I beg for your blessings so that I can strictly follow the teachings you are giving us so mercifully in your lectures, which you said are your personal instructions to all your disciples. You also mentioned that this is exactly how all rla Prabhupda�s disciples took his words � as personal instructions.\nMaharaj, I would like to mention a few aspects of your life which constantly inspire me.\n1. Your attachment to chanting the holy names of Lord is astonishing and very inspiring.\n� When someone asked you about your personal Deities, you replied that your chanting beads are your personal Deities.\n� I have heard from devotees that you have never chanted holy names casually in your life - that is how much you value the holy name.\n� When someone asked you about your favourite sweet, you replied that the Holy Name is your favourite sweet - madhuram madhurbhyo'pi.\n2. Your complete dedication in following the teachings and example set by Srila Prabhupada in all decisions that you take in his service.\n3. How expertly you teach us to see any situation in our life as an opportunity to express our dedication, devotion, and gratitude to Lord.\n4. The emphasis that you place on becoming servant of servant of servant of Vaisnavas rather than seeking limelight.\nAnd there are many more qualities of yours which keep on inspiring us in our lives.\nMaharaj, on this auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyas Puja ceremony, I only beg at your Lotus feet to award me strength and sincerity to develop attachment to these three essential principles given by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu - Nama Ruchi, Vaishnava Seva and Jiva Daya.\nAnd I beg forgiveness for all my shortcomings in trying to follow your instructions and sincerely put my full endeavour to strive to progress towards your expectations.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for who you are, and for everything you have given us.\n\nYour son,\nBhgavata Kath Dsa"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nOn this sacred occasion of your Vyas Puja, I offer my deepest gratitude at your lotus feet. Maharaj, Your compassion to all living entities, humility, and unwavering dedication to the mission of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is a living example for me and many other fallen souls. Through your teachings, your books, and your personal example, you have illuminated the path of bhakti in my life, otherwise lost in the darkness of material life.\n\nYour firm determination to search for the Absolute Truth brought you to India during your young age. In spite of so many obstacles, you continued your search of God and finally reached India. I am so much moved by reading your experiences in *Journey Home*. When I first read your experiences in *Journey Home*, I was amazed at your endurance in the search of God. After reading *Journey Home*, I immediately decided to surrender unto your lotus feet.\n\nYour life is a testament to the power of surrender. By enduring every difficulty with gratitude and every success with humility, you have shown us what it truly means to depend on Krishna. You teach not merely through eloquent words but through the purity of your actions, the steadiness of your character, and the gentleness of your heart.\n\nGurudeva, Your presence melts the hard knots of the heart. In your association, Krishna becomes not an idea, but a person; not a distant deity, but the most intimate friend. Recently, I got an opportunity to be in your association at the foothills of Shri Giriraj during Kartik Yatra 2025. I was so moved by your narration of different pastimes of the Lord, such that I felt I was physically watching the Krishna movie in 3D. Your compassion for every devotee during the Kartik Yatra had shown me its power. I personally felt so much awakening of my inner self in your association.\n\nBy your kindness, I begin to believe that despite my shortcomings, we too can become instruments of Sri Guru and Gauranga, and I too have a hope of getting liberated from the clutches of maya.\n\nI pray for the intelligence to follow your instructions, the sincerity to remember your teachings, and the strength to serve your mission with dedication. Please bless me with the willingness to put aside my ego and selfish desires, so that I may become a small, genuine servant in your divine family.\n\nOn this auspicious day, I offer my heart, my service, and my gratitude at your lotus feet. May I always remain sheltered by your guidance and never forget your kindness.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nUtpal Pandya"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Gurudeva,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances. All glories to rla Prabhupda.\n\nToday, the world rejoices. Or perhaps it only feels so to those who have experienced the shelter of your presence. As the sacred mark of your seventy-fifth year shines upon us, my heart does not leap with pride. Instead, it bows lower. I feel the quiet weight of my unworthiness and the immeasurable grace you have showered upon us.\n\nI remember that day like it was yesterday. Wednesday, the second of September 1992. It was a stormy monsoon evening in Bombay. Black clouds rumbled overhead. They threatened to burst at any moment, yet not a single drop had fallen all day. A thirteen-year-old schoolboy, young and bewildered, had wandered into the Rdh Gopntha temple hall. Was it accident or fate I cannot say.\n\nLightning split the sky. A small crowd of perhaps a dozen guests had gathered in the temple room. The curtains were about to open for the evening rati. You sifted through the crowd and walked straight towards the boy. Taking his hands in yours, you asked gently, as if enquiring on behalf of some divine power itself: \"Are you here to stay\"\n\nHe did not know what 'stay' truly meant. To stay with saints. To stay with a path. To stay with the calling of one's own soul. Yet he answered, \"Yes, I will stay.\"\n\nAs soon as he spoke these words, you smiled, showered him with a few more graceful words, and folded your hands. At that very moment, thunder rolled across the sky. The clouds, as if holding on till that sacred exchange, parted and poured torrential rains. Just as clouds give way and causelessly shower their mercy in the form of life-giving water, you showered the mercy of Lord Caitanya upon me, a soul bereft of it for many lifetimes.\nNow, more than three decades later, here I am. Still staying.\n\nAs I reflect, I see that I did not stay out of strength. I clung. I leeched on. Still clumsy. Still learning how to be a gentleman, how to be a servant, how to be grateful. If I am still here, if any fragment of sincerity has survived the storms of my mind, it is only because your words carried a potency beyond sound. It is in your sound form that you are constantly with us.\nIn your physical presence, you are like the sun. When you are out of sight, some cry that the sun has set. They no longer feel its warmth directly upon them. But the sun never sets. It simply shines elsewhere, nurturing another horizon. As you travel the globe, giving your physical presence to everyone, you are not always visible. Yet you are never absent in sound.\nIn the year 2000, you offered me a few instructions for life. I truly cherish them, meditating on them daily. I foolishly thought those were �the instructions�. With time, I learned otherwise. Every glance held guidance. Every silence spoke. Even moments where no word passed between us carried more teaching than I had space to store.\n\nBeing in your presence is illuminating. Forgetting your words is error. Remembering you is embracing grace.\n\nGurudeva, I cannot claim understanding. Nor progress. Nor qualification. But if a student's worth is measured not by brilliance but by longing, then perhaps one day even my hesitant heart may learn to walk rather than cling.\n\nUntil then, let me remain dust beneath the feet of those who follow you with clarity. Whilst I stumble and crawl behind them. Not out of despair, but out of stubborn hope.\nMay your compassion remain the compass. May your words remain the oar. May this unrefined soul continue, somehow, to remain near your light.\n\nOn this sacred day, I offer no achievement. Only gratitude. And a desire to be shaped by your grace, even if I take a lifetime to become worthy of it.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nKartik Candra dsa\nForever learning how to stay"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nAll glories to you.\nOn this auspicious occasion of your appearance day, I am reminded of how your presence on this planet is a blessing to all your disciples and all the fortunate people who come in contact with you. How you extend yourself to lovingly and selflessly reciprocate with each one of us is simply amazing. I pray that I may not waste the opportunity in this life to improve in my attempts at devotional service under your guidance.\nWatching the video recordings of you speaking in Vrindavan for this year's Kartik yatra was so inspiring: your enthusiasm and absorption in Krishna�s pastimes are so great that they seem to manifest from the sound vibration of your voice. I was reminded of SB 1.2.3: like Sukadeva Goswami spoke Srimad Bhagavatam out of his great compassion for gross materialists struggling to cross over the darkest regions of material existence, you speak Krishna lila and teachings from scriptures in such a palatable way so that, not only devotees can relish the nectar of your words, but also gross materialists like myself can get attracted to such wonderful narrations and forget sense enjoyment for the time being. One can get a glimpse of how amazing bhakti must be by observing you repeating the same lilas for years with ever-fresh enthusiasm. I pray that I may taste even a drop of that bliss that you are always immersed in.\nThank you for keeping me in Krishna consciousness.\nWhenever I find it difficult to cooperate with devotees who have different moods in Krishna consciousness, I try my best to serve them as a service to you, because I know how much it pleases you when we put aside our false ego and try to selflessly serve devotees even when it�s not so pleasant. As you said in class, as long as we are not pure devotees, the enthusiasm to serve may be an austerity; only when we come to higher stages of bhakti, enthusiasm becomes natural. Out of your great compassion for all living entities, you speak such encouraging words for those who are still struggling with anarthas and cannot understand how bhakti is not about themselves but about the Lord. How rare to find a pure devotee like you who is not interested in being great, but only concerned in making Krishna great by spreading His glories! How rare to find a special soul like you, just happy to serve and uplift others! Like Srila Prabhupada, who went through so much discomfort just for others� benefit, to spread Krishna consciousness. This is the standard of great souls in the mood of Prahlada Maharaja, although they are perfect in their Krishna consciousness, out of their compassion for the lost souls in the material world, they try their best to carry as many as possible back to the spiritual world with them. Their efforts are as glorious as their lives.\nJust like your life is, completely dedicated to the service of God. Materialistic people struggle throughout their entire lives to achieve things they are doomed to lose, but you simply serve God and His devotees and, by doing that, you are the richest person in the world because your wealth is eternal. You said in class, what is the value of things They have value only as much as we can use them to express our love to Krishna in devotional service. You gave the example of the microphone, how even a material thing can be used in inspiring people to chant the holy name. The same thing comes into my mind when I make flower garlands for Sri Sri Panchatattva and Srila Prabhupada�s murti here: flowers have such short lives, they wilt so quickly; if they don�t get offered to the Lord, what is the use of their beauty\nI pray I may become a better disciple and be able to enthusiastically follow your instructions, being firmly convinced that nothing except your instructions can be of any help to me, no matter how logical my mental concoctions may sound.\nI pray to fully take shelter of the holy name and the sacred sound vibration of your voice.\nYour servant,\nBrajadevi Devi Dasi"

I am humbled at thinking how selfless and unmotivated the act is of taking on so many unworthy and unqualified disciples, accepting them how they are without judgment. Taking on so many sins certainly can affect the spiritual master if he is not strong, but year after year, Radhanath Swami is continuing his service to his guru uninterruptedly. This shows his strength of character, and I am proud to be his disciple. Radhanath Swami instructs his disciples to be humble and tolerant, as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did, and we strive every day to purify our hearts so that one day we may be worthy of advancing as a Vaishnava, to be ourselves a humble and tolerant servant, like His Holiness. If there's one thing in particular that we are grateful for on this day, it is of the warm, kind, and fatherly presence we feel in our hearts when we are trying to carry out our devotional services. As a real guru, his presence is truly felt, and the mercy he bestows upon us as his God-children motivates us to enthusiastically go on every day serving the Lord with more vigor and more dedication to help Mahaprabhu's sankirtan movement to go on unchecked for all time to come. All glories to Radhanath Swami. Hare Krishna."

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my most humble, prostrated obeisances unto your lotus feet.\n\nIt is our great fortune to witness your 75th birthday. From the time we met you first, you have been the same changeless personality, encompassing great humility, tolerance, respect to others, and absorption in Krishna consciousness. It is difficult to find even a single small event of any deviation from true Vaishnava behavior. By your personal example, you have shown modern and often impatient devotees how a genuine Vaishnava lives and behaves.\n\nI feel grateful that such an illustrious example exists in the present time. You show how Bhakti can be lived with balance, intelligence, emotional maturity, respect, inner depth, and steady dedication to the holy name and the mission of Srila Prabhupda. Your life teaches me that true greatness does not need any display. It shines quietly through your character, your conduct, and your consistency.\n\nYou are very different from guru personalities who depend on scholarship, complex philosophy, or impressive spiritual presentations. Your strength does not come from dramatic stories or usage of esoteric language or higher realization stuff. It comes from the quiet purity of your heart. You carry a heart of gold�simple, compassionate, respectful, and sincerely dedicated to serving others without any desire to show yourself.\n\nWhat I admire most is that your devotional life stands firmly on the essentials: deep attachment to the dhma, sincere respect for the holy name, heartfelt honor for Srila Prabhupda and especially his disciples, and genuine affection for the simple Brajvasis. Their natural devotion matches your inner nature. Your connection with them is not external. It is deep, personal, and full of affection.\n\nOne quality of yours that inspires me again and again is the way you give complete attention to anyone who comes before you. Whether it is a senior devotee or a new Vaishnava, you give the same calm and full presence. Even a short moment with you makes a person feel valued and respected. There is no hurry, no distraction, and always full presence of mind and heart.\n\nYour eagerness to improve your service, refine your interactions, and deepen your sincerity is adorable and amazing. You do not present yourself as someone with extraordinary access. Your preference for honest, grounded Bhakti over philosophical show makes you easy to trust and relate with.\n\nWhen I watch you, I understand that real devotion does not need to look extraordinary. It only needs to be true. In your presence, I feel that Bhakti is not something to perform. It is something to live�quietly, sincerely, and every day. Your example reminds me that true greatness hides itself in simplicity, service, steadiness, and a deep connection to the holy name.\nThere are some recent interactions with you where I have experienced the greatness of your good self:\nA) During the construction of New Hospital in Barsana, your good self visited when the structure was complete and internal works were pending. There was a delay in the timeline for completion of the project. When you arrived, you wanted to use the washroom, and I took you to a temporary setup. Feeling responsible, I said, �Maharaj, I am sorry the project is delayed and not completed on time.�\nYour reply was spontaneous and a few words only, and that pierced my heart. You said, �I see more than the timeline whether bhakti is growing or not.� I became speechless. In that moment, I understood what you wanted me to focus on, beyond deadlines and external achievements.\n\nB) Last year, I was in a very introspective and remorseful state. Sachinandan Prabhu had unexpectedly left all of us in August 2024. He was my partner during my early preaching days in Nashik. His sudden departure left me sad and withdrawn. I often reflected on our early days together and wondered how my leaving Nashik had affected so many devotees. Every day I was simply expressing my feelings to you in my heart.\n\nIn October 2024, by your mercy, you visited Nashik after a long time. I also happened to be in Nashik and was invited to a private gathering of devotees. I sat quietly in a corner. When you entered and sat on the vyssana, one devotee pulled me closer.\nAs soon as you saw me, you smiled brightly and said, �Welcome home.�\nThose words melted my heart. They carried acceptance, affection, and genuine happiness. When you later asked me to speak, I became unusually emotional in front of the devotees. That moment healed me deeply. I felt your love and care in a very real way.\n\nC) Soon after Nashik, in the same month, I again had the opportunity to meet you at GEV. You met the CEO of Vaidyaratnam and his wife. I was there with my wife, Haripriya Gopi Devi. You were relaxed, happy, and fully available that day.\nAfter their meeting, I gently asked if we could speak with you for a few minutes. You immediately agreed. You spent around 45 minutes listening to our difficulties, our challenges, and our concerns. During this meeting, we felt so much of your affection. You kept giving us gifts, four in total for our two daughters who were not present.\nWhen we came downstairs and waited for the cart, you came again, plucked two small flowers from the garden, and said they were for our daughters. As you walked ahead, you kept looking back at us with a warm smile. That moment was a complete mercy package. Even today, remembering that, we feel overwhelmed by your unconditional love and acceptance.\n\nAll these experiences remain etched in our consciousness and keep reminding us of the true nature of a sadhu�full of genuine love and compassion.\n\nDear Gurudev, we are very fallen and disoriented. We are still struggling to completely follow all instructions given by you, still preparing to surrender, and hope that one day we can genuinely follow the mood and example set by you in a small capacity. Our children also aspire to imbibe your mood and sincerely serve your instructions and your devotees.\n\nYour unworthy servants,\nParamahamsa Das and Haripriya Gopi Devi Dasi."

At the same time, He was present with the Gopis, with the cowherd boys, with the mother cows, with other fortunate animals also, and everyone thinks and experiences that Krishna is with them only, and that too fully, not partly. I experienced this and realized that if you can do this, it was definitely done by Srila Prabhupada, and Prabhupada is still doing it with so many devotees by making them realize His presence in different manners. And what to speak of Krishna We all know, and yet many more are to be revealed by the mercy of the Vaishnavas, Gurumaharaj, and Prabhupada. Gurumaharaj, you are a living form and explanation of humility and humbleness. As we have again witnessed, your qualities and inspirations are transformable; otherwise, one more big event like the Govardhan Kartik Yatra 2025 could create havoc without any police or volunteers to manage. But your disciples are your disciples, and they try to please you by remaining patient, calm, with so much effort that no one was required as a volunteer to prevent anyone from creating noise, propaganda, or any mishap. This was surely your energy, Maharaj, nothing else, which could make 10 to 15,000 devotees sing and dance on the Mahamantra, and that too in sync without any rehearsal or directions. Even though many like me don't even know how to dance or sing the Mahamantra in the tune you were singing, you only made it. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. My personal experience is, I was not registered for the yatra and was scared about prasadam, stay, and entry, even. As if I didn't get any of these, my husband would not let me attend. But you and your disciples' aura are so magnetic that even my husband got stuck into it more than me, and somehow, by your and your disciples' mercy, everything was arranged so smoothly like butter. It was a miracle for me. You and your disciples are full of mercy. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. I always pray, Gurumaharaj, that you live my years too, because I am not useful, but you are the only hope for many's faith in devotion. I am sorry, Gurumaharaj, I will never become eligible for your shelter, but I know you can even give me your shelter even on my deathbed also. So I will always try, try, and honestly and strictly try to follow what you say, and that can only make me survive in Bhakti a bit. Since I have joined ISKCON in 2012, I didn't know anybody except you, not even Prabhupada. So for me, you were only ISKCON, and I got stuck to one of your instructions: \"The more you tolerate, the less you have to.\" And I heartily give my life to this Maharaj. Kindly bless me that I can apply all your instructions as they are.\nJai Gurumaharaj.\nJai Srila Prabhupada.\nYour servant of servants,\nJayati."

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisance.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n\nI�ve just returned from Yatra a couple of weeks ago. 10,300 devotees�some may say, \"Oh dear, that�s too much. I don�t think I can handle the crowd. Oh, the queues! Maybe it will be too impersonal, and I will not get to see Maharaj,\" and so on.\nI can�t do it on my own; I need company.\n\nI got to know and speak to many devotees around the world, including those who have been going on Yatra since the mid-eighties. When there were just a handful of devotees on the Yatra.\n\nWhen I asked them, \"So, why did Guru Maharaj start this\" they said that He wanted devotees to come together so that they could get to know each other and work better in a team. A team-building Yatra.\n\nAnd this is exactly what it is today, too, and more so. We meet devotees from all around the world and India and develop bonds with devotees we never met before or thought we would ever meet.\n\nIf there is anything I miss about being on Yatra, it�s the devotees, their association, and knowing we are not on this Krishna Conscious journey alone. We all have our trials and tests on the way, and we can share, learn, heal, and move together. One great big Sadhu Sanga.\n\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for creating this beautiful space where we are able to share with devotees and create bonds in the service of being on Yatra, which strengthens our own spiritual practice and steadies our path in devotion.\n\nYour,\nTrying to be humble servant,\nTulsi Seva Dasi"

This material body is compared to a boat, and one can cross over this vast ocean of birth and death by following the instructions of the spiritual master, who is like the captain of this boat.

I heard your first lecture and enthusiastic kirtan. Maharaj ji, at that time, I had just come from my native place and was a fresher in the city of Mumbai.

Maharaj, I remember how in my initial days I was addicted to your lectures, and they completely cleared all my doubts and gave me spiritual clarity and upliftment. Gurumaharaj, when I received the opportunity of being present in your presence and we got your vapu darshan, it is always amazing and wonderful to just see you. Also, your glance was so powerful; just by your one glance, I could feel how I am getting purified. Gurumaharaj, even though you mercifully accepted me as your disciple in a recent initiation ceremony, I felt in my heart receiving your shelter when I heard your lectures and how you saved me. Maharaj, I have no qualities which are expected. I am very much a struggling sadhaka and have committed so many offenses, but I would really beg you to forgive me and bless me. I want to follow your instructions and try to please you and at least try to develop the qualities like humility and respecting others which you emphasize the most. In one of your lectures, you have mentioned how there is no alternative for maturity and realization and how one has to be very sincere and strict in his sadhana. I would like to try to grow and follow this and also become more and more responsible in my spiritual as well as material duties.

    "Your Offering": "Om aj�na-timirhasya j�n�jana-alakya caku unmilitayena tasmi r-gurave nama\n\nOffering our deepest and most heartfelt obeisances at your lotus feet, rla Gurudeva, on the most auspicious occasion of your 75th appearance day. We feel immensely blessed to have the opportunity to express our gratitude through this humble offering. Deep within our hearts, we know that no words can ever fully convey our love for you, nor can we ever adequately thank you for the invaluable presence and guidance you have bestowed upon our lives.\n\nOne of the most important steps in advancing on the path of bhakti is spiritual nourishment, which we experience when we feel loved, cared for, and protected within the Vaiava community. In your example, we clearly see how gracefully you embody these qualities and how sincerely you have cultivated them across all the communities, mentors, counsellors, and leaders under your guidance.\n\nWe also see in your personal dealings how deeply conscious you are of everyone�s comfort, especially that of your Godbrothers and Godsisters. You never accept anything for yourself until you are sure that everyone else is cared for and comfortable. When the Vrajavss visited the Chowpatty temple, you ensured they received the same facilities and care that they are accustomed to in Vraja-dhma, making their stay as warm, respectful, and comfortable as possible. All of this truly reflects how central and meaningful devotee care is to you.\n\nRecently, we heard an incident that revealed the depth of your love and devotion for rla Prabhupda. Although you had very limited personal association with him, your heartfelt desire to serve him directly was always strong. When rla Prabhupda was about to depart from this world, he sent a message to all his disciples worldwide, requesting them to come and be with him in his final days. At that time, you were serving in New Vrindavan. Unfortunately, the authorities there chose not to announce this message to the community, thinking that if all devotees left, the services would remain unattended. As a result, you received the news only a few days after rla Prabhupda had already departed.\n\nWhat touched our hearts most was that, although you could not physically be present, rla Prabhupda personally came to you in your dreams every night. In those dreams, you were able to serve him�massaging him, cooking for him, and offering your sincere devotion directly. This deeply moving incident shows how strong your connection with rla Prabhupda truly is, and how he reciprocates your unwavering dedication and love.\n\nAnother touching incident comes from the Brooklyn temple, where a young woman from a devotee family once approached you with a heartfelt question. She asked why you had never left ISKCON despite the many challenges and difficulties the society has faced over the years. She had endured a troubled childhood due to certain issues within the Vaiava community, which had caused her to distance herself from ISKCON.\n\nWith great compassion, you shared rla Prabhupda�s profound words�that ISKCON is his body. And even when a body is wounded, bleeding, or unwell, it is the duty of a loving child to care for it even more, not to abandon it. You then gently explained, �How could I ever leave ISKCON when this is the body of my spiritual master� Your answer touched her deeply. The young woman, who had once stepped away from ISKCON, was moved to tears by your sincerity and conviction. Your words not only gave her healing but also rekindled her faith and connection to the movement.\n\nYou have always emphasised quality over quantity, and your vision has deeply inspired us. We were especially moved when we heard you say, �People are to be loved, and projects are to be used for the upliftment of the community � not the other way around.� Your words beautifully capture the essence of true leadership and remind us that genuine spiritual communities are built upon care, compassion, and personal relationships.\n\nAs HG Vrajabh Prabhu has beautifully highlighted in one of his lectures, your four most important qualities are:\n1. Live without pretending � embodying honesty\n2. Hear without defending � exemplifying humility\n3. Speak without offending � showing sensitivity\n4. Love without expecting � demonstrating selflessness\n\nWe sincerely strive to imbibe these qualities in our own lives, inspired by your example, and to reflect even a fraction of the compassion, wisdom, and devotion that you so effortlessly embody. On this auspicious day we sincerely pray for your good health and continued association.\n\nIn this beautiful lotus of the Vysa-pj book, adorned with so many fragrant and glorious petals, we humbly pray that you will accept this tiny petal of love and devotion from us�your most insignificant children. May it reach your lotus feet as a token of our gratitude, reverence, and deep affection.\n\nYour most insignificant fallen children\nNitai Prana Das\nTaruni Gopika DD\nShaunak and Kalindi\nLondon - UK"

    "Your Offering": "I feel that I am so fortunate that I got shelter at the lotus feet of my eternal spiritual master, HH Radhanath Swami Guru Maharaja. Obsessed with material desires, I was trying my best to be happy in this material world. But the more I tried to be happy here, the more frustrated I became. But by the grace of Maharaja, today I know that trying for pleasure in this land of death is like looking for nectar in a poison jar. But just knowing the fact is not sufficient enough to attain salvation. To attain liberation from a miserable life and attain shelter at the lotus feet of Krishna, we have to give up all material attachments and get joyfully attached to the lotus feet of Krishna, who is the source and reservoir of eternal pleasure.\n\nOn our own, to attain that state is an impossible task, but if we get the shelter of the lotus feet of pure devotees of Krishna, then crossing over the ocean of material miseries becomes very easy. Even Prahlada Maharaja says that the only way by which we can free ourselves from the clutches of material attachments is by bathing in the dust of the lotus feet of a devotee of Krishna.\n\nWe are fortunate that we have got an opportunity to take shelter of the dust of the lotus feet of HH Radhanath Swami Guru Maharaja, who is so fully absorbed in chanting and sharing the glories of Krishna constantly.\n\nJust like the bright rays of the sun dissipate darkness, similarly, Maharaja illuminates the heart of unfortunate souls like me, who are engulfed in the darkness of ignorance. When we hear the glories of Krishna from the lotus mouth of Maharaja, then our heart, which mostly cries in pain because of material obsession, begins dancing in joy.\n\nMaharaja dedicated his life at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, and as per the desire and instruction of Prabhupada, he has been spending every moment of his life in spreading Krishna Consciousness all over the world. Maharaja�s dedication to Krishna Consciousness is unprecedented, his glories are unlimited, and his determination is unparalleled.\n\nOn his 75th Vyasa Puja, I would like to share a few glories of Maharaja which are so inspiring.\n\nExperiencing joy in sharing Krishna Katha - Whenever I hear any lecture of Maharaja, I see that he speaks about Krishna from the core of his heart. He speaks for hours with great enthusiasm and energy. Sometimes, when he shares the pastimes of the Lord, it seems that he has been part of all those pastimes. During the recent Kartik Yatra in Govardhan, he spoke for hours about Krishna�s Govardhan lila. Maharaja spoke in such detail about the different places of Govardhan Parikrama that all of us who were hearing him did parikrama of Govardhan again and again just by hearing it from the lotus mouth of Maharaja.\n\nThe brajvasis lived with Krishna in Vrindavan 5000 years ago and enjoyed various pastimes with Krishna. By the grace of Maharaja, we got an opportunity to relish those inconceivable pastimes of Krishna sitting near Giriraj Govardhan this Kartik Yatra.\n\nJust as Maharaja enjoys sharing pastimes of Krishna constantly, I pray to him for his mercy so that I develop a taste for constantly relishing Krishna katha.\n\nInspiring devotees to give up sense gratification: The goal of life is to give up material sense gratification and engage our senses in the service of Krishna. But we know that our senses have become so addicted to sense gratification that, in spite of us doing our best, we fail to give up the enjoying mentality. Scriptures say that only by the mercy of great souls, we will get the determination and ability to shun material enjoyment. In my experience, every morning when I get up, I take a vow not to indulge in sense gratification, but as the day passes, I find how difficult it is to say no to the demands of the mind and senses. In spite of knowing the danger of sense indulgence, I fail to give it up.\n\nBut at least during Kartik Yatra, I see that I get some strength to stay away from sense gratification. When I sit with hundreds of devotees hearing Maharaj�s katha, I experience how wonderful it is to engage senses in hearing the pastimes of Krishna.\n\nMaharaja mercifully is teaching me how to shun sense gratification and indulge completely in the service of Krishna. By doing so, one day I will become eligible to go back to Godhead and live with Krishna and his wonderful devotees in his abode.\n\nTeaching us to remember Srila Prabhupada: During the Govardhan Kartik yatra, we celebrated the 129th disappearance day of Srila Prabhupada in the pandal. Maharaj organized the program in such a wonderful way that we got an opportunity to hear wonderful glories of Prabhupada and important lessons which Prabhupada teaches us.\n\nDevotees were so inspired to serve Prabhupada as per the guidelines of Maharaja that they cooked several bhoga items for Prabhupada. Maharaj, in one of the classes, said that there were 300 bhoga items which were offered to Prabhupada. We offered Pushpanjali to Prabhupada at noon, and there was guru puja followed by prasadam.\n\nIn the evening, Maharaj so beautifully sang � je anilo prem dhan. We all got so immersed in the song that we felt separation from Srila Prabhupada. Although physically I have never got the opportunity to take darshan of Prabhupada, but I am able to see him through Maharaja.\nSeeing Maharaj�s dedication for Srila Prabhupada was so inspirational. We also learnt how our life should be dedicated to Srila Prabhupada and how we should be enthusiastically serving his mission.\n\nBinding devotees together with love: One of the biggest challenges which people face in the world is their inability to get along with each other. Even in a small family, we see disputes, quarrels, heartbreaks, and complaints.\n\nBut it is amazing to see how during every Kartik Yatra, more than 10,000 devotees from different parts of the world stay together united for more than a week. There is no quarrel, disagreement, chaos, heartburns, and complaints. Everyone respects others and tries to help others.\n\nEven if there are some challenges and difficulties, still devotees, understanding the circumstances, do not become disheartened and dissatisfied. It is because they know the purpose for which they have gathered.\n\nAnd most importantly, the joy all gets in associating with Maharaj makes all difficulties and challenges appear insignificant. When the heart gets flooded with Maharaj�s nectarean lectures and melodious kirtan, then all material pains just disappear.\n\nTeaching us how to see all spiritual masters with equal vision: Maharaj teaches by his own example how we should deal with the disciples of Srila Prabhupada, the present spiritual masters in ISKCON, and all the devotees who are connected with ISKCON.\nMaharaja showers great love and respect especially upon his godbrothers and godsisters. This is why we see so many of his godbrothers and godsisters come during Maharaj�s Kartik Yatra year after year. We also get an opportunity to hear from them their personal realizations and their experience of dealing with Srila Prabhupada. Maharaj teaches us that we should not be guru fanatic. We should see all spiritual masters with equal vision and should have utmost respect for them.\n\nMaharaj�s glories are unlimited, but I am trying to share a few of those for my personal purification. On Maharaja�s 75th Vyasa Puja, I pray at the divine feet of Sri Sri Radha Govinda, Lord Jagannath, Baladeva, and Subhadra Maharani, Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga, and Srila Prabhupada to give me determination so that I follow the footsteps of Maharaja and never leave his lotus feet. I also beg at the lotus feet of Maharaja to shower his mercy upon me so that I develop distaste for sense gratification and develop taste in hearing and sharing the glories of Krishna.\n\nHH Radhanath Swami Guru Maharaj�s eternal servant\nPurushottam Nitai Das\nISKCON Newtown, Kolkata, India"

Devotees were dancing to the musical rhythms. That moment, though brief, planted a seed of devotion that I could not understand at that time. I only knew one thing: seeing you filled my heart with a kind of peace I had never experienced.\n\nGurudev, I am unqualified in every way. My heart is still filled with weaknesses and impurities. It is only by your blessings that your pure and sincere devotees are helping me, guiding me, and giving me direction to remain connected to the divine mission of rla Prabhupda. I am able to submit my offerings to you because of the shelter provided by your compassionate disciples and followers.\n\nGurudev, during the Govardhan Kartik Yatra of October 2025, hearing your profound realizations that Krishna accepts even the smallest sincere effort, that Giriraj Govardhan is the embodiment of �raya-tattva� � the shelter of all devotees, that Govardhan is the greatest servant of Krishna, serving everyone selflessly, that parikrama is not physical exercise but a journey of the heart, that despite being a small boy, Krishna effortlessly lifted Giriraj for seven days, that the lifting of Giriraj is not about strength but about affection � �Krishna can lift mountains, but what pleases Him most is the sincere desire of a devotee�s heart.�\n\nGurudev, I am having a desire to take harinm-dk from Your Holiness. I sincerely aspire to grow in chanting, humility, and service. Please bless me so that I may become fit to follow your teachings and serve rla Prabhupda�s mission with sincerity.\n\nThank you, Gurudev, for giving meaning to my life from that first darshan in Pune to the profound experiences at Govardhan.\n\nEvery step of the journey has been guided by your mercy.\n\nrla Prabhupd Ki Jai!\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nPriya Ranjan Kumar"

First, for setting a wonderful example in everything�be it Morning program, attentive-absorbing chanting, your love, respect, attachment for Srila Prabhupada and his disciples; simplicity in dealings and belongings; humility and much more. Thanks a lot for this very much, Maharaj, as we need more good examples of sincere practitioners than just those who speak.\n\nThe most important thing I want to thank you for is this year's Yatra, where you are giving yourself fully and perfectly in the form of classes and kirtans. The classes were so inspiring, nourishing, and uplifting, and I am happy and grateful that the classes were long. Kirtans were also deep, uplifting, and very spiritually recharging. We can see, Maharaj, both in the classes and kirtans, you were giving yourself completely to bless us with pure devotional service. Also, the management of the Yatra was so inspiring, where every department and every devotee was working hard to serve and please you. It goes to show how much you inspired them by your words and actions that they are ready to do everything and anything to see a pleasing smile on your face and the faces of devotees.\n\nThank you very much, Maharaj, for giving us so much and so many things. I offer my sincere prayers at your lotus feet, expressing my deepest gratitude, and beg you, beg you from the core of my heart to bless me with the strength to take your teachings and instructions as my heart and soul and become an instrument in your hands to connect others to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour aspiring servant of servants,\nSonar Gauranga das."

Everyone of us is very excited to celebrate this special Vyasapuja. I am inspired to see everyone�s enthusiasm, love, and devotion to make your 75th Vyasapuja very special.\nWe pray to Sri Sri Radha Kalachandji to bestow you a very long, healthy life.\nIt�s enlivening to hear short meditations from you every day from your lectures and wonderful Vyasapuja offerings from senior devotees counting down 75 days. We are grateful to those devotees who made these accessible to all of us.\n\nMaharaj, along with a few realizations that I would like to offer you this year, I thought of putting some of your qualities out of many millions of qualities in an acronym �RADHANATH SWAMI�\n\nR - Radharani�s dearest son\nA - Attracted to the blue boy, Sri Krishna\nD - Devoted to Srila Prabhupada\nH - Holds Vrindavan in your heart\nA - Attached to the holy names\nN - Not an ordinary person. We shouldn�t even think of a spiritual master to be ordinary. Even during the last day of this year�s Karthik yatra, HG Burijana prabhu mentioned, you have a special potency to be able to sit up in the same posture and give Krishna Katha for hours.\nA - Always eager to learn from every situation\nT - Train disciples by your example\nH - Highly realized soul\n\nS - Sharing Krishna Consciousness is your mission\nW - Withstand the most difficult circumstances\nA - Always prayerful\nM - Mesmerize the hearts of the devotees with Krishna katha\nI - Inspire us to be the servant of the servant of the gopis in every lecture of yours and through every act of yours\n\nMaharaj, this year has been a wonderful journey. We had the good fortune of your association at the Sadhu Sanga retreat. I felt so much in that retreat like never before. Like many of us, I always wanted to be closer to you and try to be around when there was a possibility. But, Maharaj, this time, I realized you are giving yourself completely without any reservation to all of us whenever you are giving your lecture or doing kirtan. Then I thought, we shouldn�t be bothering you unnecessarily unless there is a need for my service. During Srila Prabhupada�s disappearance day offering in the pandal, you mentioned, if one is attached to the vani of the spiritual master, the vapu association of the Guru in its fullest form will manifest in the heart of the devotee. Maharaj, I really beg for your mercy to be able to follow this instruction of yours to hear your lectures attentively and practice your teachings to the best of my ability.\n\nWe are very, very grateful for allowing us to be part of the wonderful Govardhan yatra this year. We can�t imagine our good fortune to be able to stay in Govardhan for 7 days and 7 nights, as Krishna lifted Govardhan for 7 days and 7 nights to protect all the vrajabasis. It was an amazing yatra, but it was not very easy due to Parikrama marg being closed on Diwali day, Govardhan puja day, as Govardhan was very crowded with many other pilgrims, and the commute between rooms and the pandal was far. But the good thing about it is every time we were traveling from the room to the pandal, we were getting an opportunity to do parikrama of Giriraj Govardhan. It�s a blissful experience just being in Govardhan inspite of all external factors. Maharaj, your lectures are amazing, deeper, and longer. You wanted to give all of us whatever you can give or more in those 3-4 hours. You were completely immersed in Krishna Katha. Unless there is a supreme power empowering you, it�s unbelievable for a 75-year-old person to sit straight for 3-4 hours without moving and speak Krishna�s pastimes with such enthusiasm. You probably can continue with the same immersion for even many more hours. But you end the lecture as it will get late for all of us, the audience.\n\nMaharaj, you always glorify in your yatra lectures the devotees who make chapatis for the devotees. This year, I personally got to witness their joy in serving the devotees by making chapatis. I am grateful to be able to serve with them for a few hours on one of the days. They serve from early morning 4:30 am till 2:30 pm for 10 hours continuously by kneading the chapati dough, rolling them, cooking them. But they are so blissful in doing their service. We also felt so much joy in being with them for a few hours.\n\nMaharaj, I met one of the matajis who was in that chapati making team from Belgaum. She is a very simple, middle-aged lady. We were exchanging our names. She told her name is Sukha Sagari. I told her my name. Then she asked me, did Maharaj explain to you the meaning of your name I told no. She told me that Maharaj explained the meaning of her name. Probably she got initiated in the 90s when you used to explain the meaning of names of all the initiated devotees. Maharaj, probably you would like to do the same even now if it wasn�t for hundreds of initiations on the same day. She told that Maharaj explained the pastime of the devotee named Dukhi who carried water pots during Chaitanya Mahaprabhu�s pastime, and Srivas Pandit prabhu told her name as Dukhi. Then Chaitanya Mahaprabhu immediately told her name, \"From now on, Sukhi.\" Maharaj told this is the meaning of your name. Similarly, Sukha Sagari mentioned that she lost her husband and was left with three children. So her life was also very miserable like Dukhi, but after Maharaj gave her initiation and named her Sukha Sagari, her life became very peaceful after that. She was telling, \"Our Guru Maharaj is not ordinary; he is very special, connected to the Guru parampara all the way up to Krishna. So he knows what is needed for the disciple.\"\n\nWhile making chapatis, Sukha Sagari mataji was humbly guiding us and telling all of us that in those 10 hours of service every day, she never let one chapati get burnt and go to waste. They are very conscious in their service. Maharaj, I pray at your lotus feet, please bless us also with a minute fraction of their enthusiasm to serve the devotees.\n\nMaharaj, we would like to thank HG Prem Chandra prabhu for facilitating Journey Home hearing narrated by you in a group setting in Dallas. Our sons, Chaitanya Charana and NadiaVihari, love to hear and read The Journey Home, and they love to hear again and again your New Vrindavan lecture series with so many adventure stories. Maharaj, please bless them to be attached to the words emanating from your lotus mouth and to be able to perform devotional service.\n\nMaharaj, we beg for your mercy to be able to chant the holy names attentively, to cooperate with devotees, and together render service in a way pleasing to you and Srila Prabhupada. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for all that you do for all of us.\n\nYour grateful daughter,\nSada Nandini Devi Dasi."

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj.\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\n\nWhat can I say Maharaj, I am a fool blessed by your mercy. I don't know what unimaginable mercy has come upon me. I can only remember the day when we caught a train early morning from Pune to reach Chowpatty for your SB class. All the VOICE devotees had planned to come. In rushing to catch the train, I fell down at the gate of Kunjabihari mandir, ISKCON Camp Pune, and both of my knees got bruised, but still, we went ahead and caught the train and reached CST. And from there, we came to your SB class. I don't remember much of the class, but after the class, you were strolling around the temple, and suddenly some devotee said this is the opportunity to touch the lotus feet of Maharaj. All matajis were touching your feet, and I also felt I should not miss this opportunity. I could touch your feet and soon I thought, what a fool I am, so arrogant to touch your feet.\nI was feeling very sorry, but then I thought I could ask for forgiveness. Then soon I was standing in the courtyard of Radha Gopinath mandir, and you came. I bowed down and in my heart offered a prayer and asked for forgiveness, and you compassionately gazed at me as if you understood everything. After this, only my spiritual life took off. From this day onwards, I never looked back. All my life is just a smooth journey personally orchestrated by Krishna. Only thing I regret is I could have taken birth a little earlier and helped you in manifesting the Chowpatty project. My only aspiration is in the next life, I assist you very closely in making another Chowpatty Mandir in some universe right from the scratch.\nHere now, as I am serving in ISKCON Pune NVCC as a brahmacari, what a great blessing it is to be here under the care of HG Radheshyam Prabhu. Who is an apt representative of yours. Only by the great inspiration of HG Radheshyam Prabhu did the devotees come into my college, and I could get connected. He is like a great father, only because of whose timely guidance I am in the brahmacari ashram today.\nDear Guru Maharaj, in the recent Kartik Yatra in Govardhan, when you were doing kirtans, you were repeatedly saying, \"Let us give our self fully to the Holy Name.\" This gesture of yours has deeply empowered my chanting. Whenever I now chant, I chant with this effort of giving myself fully, and I feel I am more closer to the Holy Name. Whenever the mind is trying to cheat, your rock-solid and steady image gives me so much solace and strength that I feel I will surely make it in this lifetime by your grace. I wish in some lifetime I come with you, catching your hand at Radha Kunda, the same famous painting where Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Prabhupada is giving his instruction to our Srila Prabhupada at Radha Kunda, and Srila Prabhupada's son is catching his hand. I am an ignorant fool to think and imagine like this, but this is only what I can think of. Thinking of meeting Radha and Krishna is beyond my scope, but surely I can assist you in your service to Srila Prabhupada.\nAnd since it is Srila Prabhupada's glorification, if I don't do it here, you will not like it, so I will put my best effort to glorify Srila Prabhupada also. I can only dare to hear the sound of the waves on that ferocious ocean in which Jaladuta was crossing the Atlantic. I can't dare to imagine the seasickness there and what pain Srila Prabhupada could have undergone is unimaginable. I wonder what kind of determination that is; it is humanly impossible. Such tolerance and such burning desire to fulfill the words of Guru. How much faith Srila Prabhupada had on the Holy Name and the message of Srimad Bhagavatam. His love for His disciples is beyond measure.\nSo much he has given Himself to everyone. So much he tolerated. And what a compassionate friend He was of Gandhiji. That at the fag end of Gandhi's life, Srila Prabhupada remembered him. He wrote him and advised. Who else can be such a well-wisher of anyone He was indeed the ever well-wisher of everyone. His love is beyond comparison. Love of a million mothers is insufficient in front of Srila Prabhupada. So much focus Srila Prabhupada had on the mission. Tireless translations and classes with the clarity of diamond. This certainly can't be imitated. He envisioned a future of which today I am reaping immense benefits.\nHe is still there in the very same temple I am serving, so much accessible through His books. He is an acarya. He can never leave us. He is watching me. I feel I am not doing my best to please Him. Some day I can serve my best to please Him. He speaks with the authority of all the acaryas and yet is as gracious as a swan. He speaks like a concerned father calling his loved son - \"Brahmananda\" or \"Bali-mardana\"... \"You can take charge of this project here.\" So much encouragement and empowerment He gave to all. I can feel a tinge of the loss the disciples of Srila Prabhupada might have felt when He left the planet.\nAs an irreparable loss, this is like a calamity. But Srila Prabhupada lives in His instructions and the faithful followers. As a constant guide, He is there in His books. I have no more words to speak. I wish to just try to follow to the best of my capabilities the teachings of Srila Prabhupada. The mountain of anarthas in my heart is huge, but there is hope in the power of the Guru parampara.\nSrila Prabhupada was a fearless preacher, always thinking big.\nDear Guru Maharaj, as you rightly know me as a fearful and timid servant, you have rightly blessed me by your mercy to take shelter of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nAbhaya Govinda Dasa."

    "Your Offering": "Brought up in the city of Amritsar with very conventional desires, I never thought I would be fortunate enough to know someone as special as H.H. Radhanath Swami Maharaj, let alone call him my Guru.\nDuring yatras, he cooks and serves prasad to devotees with utmost humility and seva bhav. When he does kirtan, the feeling of surrender and love for Krishna can be heard in his voice, filling the room with a divine energy. When he tells stories, he does it with such conviction that he transports you to the world where those divine leelas are happening. He smiles his wonderful smile when asked unexpected questions after lectures, and answers them perfectly, as if the question was never unexpected in the first place.\nWhen he came to Amritsar, he chose not to step on the petals spread for his lotus feet. He greeted everyone with folded hands. I have seen photos and videos of him embracing cows and calves with deep compassion, accepting flowers from little children, and blessing them with so much love and care. Maharaj does not just preach humility and compassion; he lives them. And he lives them so beautifully that, for a moment, you forget he is a global personality with thousands and lakhs waiting for even a minute of his association.\nAfter so many years in bhakti, with countless disciples and lectures, he still leads a life of simplicity, and that is inspirational. Sometimes, a little appreciation or success in seva can make one think, �I did it.� But Maharaj is not like that. He lives by the verse:\nTrinad api sunicena\nTaror api sahishnuna\nAmanina manadena\nKirtaniyah sada Hari\nAs a teen, he set out to find the true meaning and purpose of life. That journey challenged him physically, mentally, and emotionally. But he never gave up. His commitment inspires me, because he moved continents with faith, endured struggles with faith, and ultimately found what he was seeking because of that same faith. That faith is the guiding light of my life and the lives of many others. When he faced theft, uncertainty, and loneliness on his journey, he still found hope in the smallest signs. But today, we don�t have to move continents; we have Maharaj�s blessings and guidance.\nSo when the road of life gets bumpy, when things feel too hard or complicated, may I also be able to say the words from one of the letters he wrote to his family: �Roads get bumpy at times, but they are fine roads.�\nI am not as great, wise, or learned as Maharaj; in fact, I am not even the dust on His feet, but I can try to walk the path he shows us, not just through his lectures, but through his way of life. To have faith like he did, and to be humble like he is, while doing whatever little seva I get to do�these are the goals of my life.\nHH Radhanath Swami Maharaj Ki Jai!"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna dear Maharaj,\nIt's hard for me to believe that this year is going to be your 75th Vyas Puja. Time flies by so quickly. With each passing year, the amount of time that we have to be living in the same contemporary time as you keeps on reducing. I get shivers whenever I think about this. It makes me want to utilize every opportunity to be able to get your darshan and hear from your lotus mouth.\nMaharaj, I feel that I owe my entire spiritual life to you. I had always been antagonistic toward organized religion and especially ISKCON. Due to my severe conditioning, the culture of Krishna consciousness as I had seen it from afar seemed very alien to me. It was only a chance reading of your book \"The Journey Home\" that I got the inspiration to try out Krishna consciousness. Back in 2013 when I read your book, I remember thinking to myself that if this seeker of truth spent so much time and effort in traveling all over India and trying out all the major spiritual paths and if he settled down upon Krishna consciousness and ISKCON, then there must definitely be something about this path. I still remember the struggle of my initial few years in Krishna consciousness when I would read and re-read Srila Prabhupada's books trying to feel attracted to the philosophy but wasn't able to because of my previous attachments to impersonalistic philosophy. All during that while I felt like quitting so many times, but each time I would always remember you thinking that if you have been following this path for so many years, then this path is certainly the highest. I took my own sweet time to be completely convinced of the path, and it took many years for my faith to get steady. During this time, your lectures used to give me a lot of solace. Also, I got excellent mentorship and guidance from your disciples.\nIt's been twelve years since I started practicing Krishna consciousness, and I can see a vast difference in myself then and now. Every time I think about what direction my life would have gone in if I hadn't come across your book, I shudder. I have never had a personal interaction with you. But if I ever have one, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything that you have done.\nYour insignificant aspiring servant,\nSiddharth"

Despite this heavy rain, you came to the banks for the Godavari Aarti. Despite the cold weather, you gave initiation the next day. On Dussehra, you performed Godavari Puja and Aarti, followed by the burning of Ravana. After all this, you sat on the banks and prayed for all the devotees. Despite such a large three-day program, you called a small meeting for close devotees at the Nashik Congregation on the fourth morning. In that meeting, you recalled all the old memories, from the beginning of the Nashik ISKCON campaign. There was an exchange of words amongst devotees. The experience of that meeting was unique. The devotees of Nashik ISKCON sponsored the 'Ter Kadam GEV Project' at that meeting.\n\nMaharaj, I am always excited for the Kartik Yatra because of your beautiful discourses, captivating kirtans, and the gathering of thousands of devotees. During this year's Govardhan Yatra, you provided me with a sweet experience of katha and kirtan for hours which made me even more excited. After the morning chanting, you would come to oversee the kitchen management. You would keep an eye on how everyone, from young children to the elderly,were being served.\n\nWhen the offerings for the Govardhan Puja were being prepared, you came and showered your blessings on all the devotees, and I still remember your smile and laughter.\n\nMaharaj, you are so compassionate that you accepted a disciple like me.

There was a lot to learn about devotee care from the very thoughtful management of the yatra.\nWhen you were doing katha, Maharaja ji, I felt you were speaking to me personally. In fact, I felt that the Guru Parampara was speaking through you. When you were singing kirtans, I felt transported to the spiritual world! And on the last day, we followed you to the car, imbibing your radiance and repossessing your aura till the time we can see you again!\nGuru Maharaja ji, one moment that will always stay with me is the one when you spoke about Srila Prabhupada leaving his body.

We also conduct online/offline classes for them. Every year, thousands of children/households receive Srila Prabhupada's books (last year, about 30,000). I am grateful for my mentors for engaging me in this service.\nI also try to coordinate cultural programs on the festivals, and I am happy to say that the IGF is participating very enthusiastically.\nNow is the time for Gita Marathon, and we are starting with blessings from our senior Vaishnavas.

You preach what you follow yourself.\nMaharaj, you have been an inspiration to one and many.\nMy recent yatra with you and fellow devotees to Govardhan has made a lasting impression of such wonderful devotees we have in our congregation.\nI happened to be visiting Surya Kund, and we, along with others, boarded a bus (the last bus arranged for latecomers) which did not have a coordinator, rather a bus leader. The bus driver took us to a place where the other buses were not there.\nMany devotees were not satisfied, and they argued with the driver, as walking on an unknown path was risky for senior citizens.\nHe was helpless and confused, so he took the help of a local small boy (around 15 years old) and asked him to navigate the path for all of us.\nAnd low and behold, it was a very uneven road, and to my nightmare, I tripped and slipped, falling on my knee.\nIt was hard for me to get up, but all around me were being extremely careful and helpful, making all arrangements from a chair to a pickup, to arranging an auto to take me to the taxi (with security).\nAll of them were PUNE devotees.\nI didn't know them, and they didn't know me, but there was amazing coordination to help me out with a daring spirit and helpful attitude.\nA couple and their daughter continuously accompanied me and were there to comfort me. They sacrificed their visit to temples and all the places and were there to monitor and make me feel at ease and comfort me with their presence.\nThis spirit of sacrifice, help, and concern trickles down from you, Maharaj, to Jhanva mataji, and then to her council members. I am so grateful to the Pune devotees as their concern and affection made me oblivious of my own pain. I was moved by their concern and help at the time when I needed it the most. Naina Manjari mataji, when I asked her to be with fellow yatris to visit all places, so genuinely quoted that Radhanath Maharaj says, \"More important are people than any projects.\" This attitude brought tears to my eyes, and she was actually living by it (without any remorse of missing out on places and temples).\n\nI am short of words, Maharaj, the way they have been nurtured under your guidance.\nMay this spirit of sacrifice, care, and love also trickle into me through your mercy, Maharaj, so that I can offer a simple flower of affection and care to all who come across my way and of whom you can feel proud.\nIn your service,\nRegards,\nPriti Gaurangi dd"

But Maharaj, you have the best network. Therefore, you have a Maha Range.\n\nYou can connect from �\n1. Millionaires to renouncers.\n2. Harvard graduates to pre-primary students.\n3. Bankers to beggars.\n\nWhen one makes garlands, great pain has to be caused to the flower by the needle. Never has the world seen a flower, after being poked by a needle, looking at it and saying, \"You made my day.\"\nBut I have seen this happening.\nWhen you speak and people experience you, you are actually like a needle cutting through their hearts. But after your powerful words have entered into their hearts, they feel grateful to you. This is preaching. Touching people�s hearts leaves people feeling grateful.\nA garland has many types of flowers: some costly, some cheap; some fragrant, some not; some good-looking, some average.\nBut for a needle, it is happy to enter each flower, network, and connect them through the thread to make a beautiful garland.\nYou are like this needle, entering into people's lives�some beautiful, some rich, some influential, some poor, some distressed, and some sinful�connecting all of them by constantly traveling the world, through the thread of Krsna bhakti, and making a beautiful garland for the pleasure of Radha Gopinath.\nEvery flower is grateful to be poked and connected by you.\nMay I continue seeing flowers connected through you and serve you in this way.\n\nYour servant,\n\nShubha Vilas Das"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n \nOn this most auspicious occasion of your 75th Appearance Day, we bow down with hearts overflowing in gratitude. We cannot fathom the extent of our good fortune for being sheltered under the divine grace of Srila Prabhupada, blessed by your causeless mercy, and guided by the loving association of so many of our godbrothers and godsisters. By your unlimited compassion, you are teaching us, showing us, and leading us with the very essence of spirituality. You are a reservoir of divine qualities and streams of nectarean wisdom continually flow from your lotus mouth, cleansing and nourishing our hearts. Your oceanic compassion showers even the most fallen souls like us, giving us an opportunity to relish the path of devotion. We are just insignificant and have nothing worthy to offer, but with folded hands, we beg the following from you:\n \n\t� May we chant the Holy Names with sincerity: Your absorption in chanting the Holy Names and singing kirtan from the core of your heart inspires us beyond measure. When once asked about your favourite sweet, you replied that the Hare Krishna Mahamantra is the sweetest of all sweets, for it offers the greatest flavour to the heart and the ecstasy of unmotivated and uninterrupted loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. We are awestruck with your natural attachment for the narration of eternal pastimes of the Lord and His devotees. O Gurudeva, kindly bless us to constantly endeavour to hear Krishna Katha with attention and to chant the Holy Names with strong faith and deep feeling.\n\t \n\t� May we serve the Lord and His devotees with humility: Your life is a living scripture that teaches us true humility. We remain eternally grateful for the way you express your love through the selfless spirit of menial service to please Krishna. We are reminded of the days you tirelessly served as a pujari, worshipping the Deities, caring for the cows, hardly even sleeping, and offering everything for the pleasure of the Lord. You often narrate the pastimes of Sridhara Kolaveca, Suklambar Brahmacari, and Ghanashyam Baba, urging us to realize that the highest position in the world is to be the servant of the servant, devoid of false ego and free from personal motivation. O Gurudeva, let our consciousness, desires, words, and actions align with this ideal, to be eager and joyful to serve with no expectation of anything from anyone in return.\n\t \n\t� May we live with responsibility and share Srila Prabhupada�s teachings with integrity: We are amazed by your unwavering dedication to glorify Srila Prabhupada. Your determination to manifest Srila Prabhupada�s instructions in tangible form, whether in nurturing the spiritual atmosphere of GEV or establishing monumental offerings in Kolkata, fills our hearts with unlimited reverence. O Gurudeva, please empower us to embrace every word of Srila Prabhupada with a sense of urgency, seriousness, and responsibility. May our lives become instruments to serve you faithfully and with full integrity.\n \nOur heartfelt prayers at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath to always keep you in good health. May They continually fill us with the mercy of your blessed association, and may They grant us to imbibe even a fraction of your mood and mission, living only to please Srila Prabhupada and serve your vision.

Yet, for the pleasure of the devotees and out of my own longing, I am making this humble attempt. Please forgive me for any offenses I may commit while doing so.\n\nMaharaj, you are the very embodiment of utmost humility, gratitude, and compassion. Your sense of servitude is beyond imagination; every gesture, every action expands it manifold, reaching across hearts and lifetimes. There could be no greater inspiration than to see such a living example before us.\n\nYour dedication and deep sense of indebtedness to Srila Prabhupada are truly exemplary. This inspires me greatly. In almost every lecture, you effortlessly invoke Srila Prabhupada with such grace and natural devotion, that it increases our gratitude both toward Srila Prabhupada and toward your own divine stature.\n\nPersonally, my life has been deeply influenced by you. Beyond offering guidance in various aspects of life, your lectures have been answers to some of the most important questions I struggled with. They have guided my path and have helped place me in a much more meaningful and spiritually grounded position now. Maharaj, I cannot thank you enough, nor can I ever repay even a fraction of the inconceivable mercy you have bestowed upon me.\n\nWhen I was in darkness, your lectures brought light and hope. When I was in pain, they became a soothing balm. When I was in deep distress, they nurtured me like a mother�s embrace. When I had lost trust in the people around me, your words rekindled faith and steadiness within.\n\nAlthough I have not always been able to fully follow your instructions, especially to view adversity as the Lord�s opportunity for surrender and growth in bhakti, I sincerely tried my best. Simply by placing faith in your words, I was able to pass through some of the darkest nights of my life. Looking back now, I see clearly how your loving guidance has sustained, protected, and uplifted me. It is solely by your mercy that I am able to perform even the smallest efforts in bhakti�efforts that were once impossible for me.\n\nIt is also by your mercy that I have received the companionship of my husband, who cares for me so beautifully and who has further strengthened my surrender and devotion to Srila Prabhupada and his mission.\n\nMaharaj, we sincerely beg for your continued mercy so that we may serve Srila Prabhupada�s mission. We have no qualification and many anarthas, yet we deeply desire to offer whatever little service we can. We know that we can never repay even a single drop of what Srila Prabhupada has given us, but we earnestly wish to dedicate our lives to him�and this is only possible through your empowerment. We depend solely on your mercy.\n\nMaharaj, please continue to bless us. We truly need it�more and more.\n\nLastly, I always look forward to Karthik Yatra. Every moment of it is so precious, and it has created a profound and lasting impact within my heart�something I will cherish throughout my lifetime. Thank you once again for this immeasurable gift.\n\nI wanted to write so much more. I waited for the right mood and the right time, but it simply did not come. And today, the final day for submission, somehow I have been able to write something. Please accept it as it is.\n\nVery, very grateful to you, Maharaj, for all that you have done for all of us.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nShalini"

Guru Maharaj, I am such an unqualified, tiny soul, and your compassion is so vast, so deep, so ocean-like, that I constantly feel unable to describe how much you have transformed my life.\n\nYou have never looked at my faults, my weakness, or my immaturity. Instead, you have always seen the tiny spark of sincerity that even I sometimes fail to notice. Every time I fall, you lift me. Every time I drift away, your instructions pull me back. Every time darkness surrounds me, your presence becomes the only light I can walk towards.\n\nGuru Maharaj, whatever little devotion I have, whatever little sincerity I try to practice, whatever little progress I make � all of it is born only from your mercy. I have no strength of my own. My entire spiritual life stands on the foundation of your compassion. Without you, I have no direction, no shelter, no purpose. With you, even the smallest step becomes meaningful.\n\nMy biggest prayer, my deepest longing, my only dream is that one day I may receive initiation from you. I know I have no qualification. I make mistakes, I fall short, I struggle. But I also know that qualification is not created by the disciple � it is created by the mercy of the Guru. I am only praying for that mercy. I am only waiting with hope that someday you will allow me to sit at your lotus feet and receive that life-changing blessing.\n\nGuru Maharaj, you are the one who teaches me how to love Krishna, how to remember Him, how to serve Him, how to purify my heart. You are the voice that guides my lost mind back to the path of devotion. You are the place where my restless heart finally finds peace. You are the living example of Srila Prabhupada�s compassion, moving in this world to save souls like me.\n\nOn this Vyasa Puja day, I want to offer you a small poem from my heart:\n\n*�Guru Maharaj�\nYour mercy is the sky,\nand I am just a small bird\nlost in its endless blue.\n\nYour words are the Ganga,\nand I am a trembling drop\ntrying to merge into their purity.\n\nWhen my faith cracks,\nyou hold it like a fragile flame\nand protect its last light.\n\nYou never asked me to be perfect �\nonly sincere.\nYou never demanded qualification �\nonly surrender.\n\nEvery heartbeat of mine\nis slowly learning to beat\nin the rhythm of your teachings.\n\nIf you ever look at me\nwith even one drop of mercy,\nmy entire destiny will change.\n\nPlease allow me, one day,\nto receive initiation from you �\nnot because I deserve it,\nbut because your compassion\nis greater than all my faults.�**\n\nGuru Maharaj, on your divine appearance day, I bow down and offer my entire life at your lotus feet. Whatever I am, whatever I have, whatever I will ever be � I want it all to be an offering to you and Srila Prabhupada.\n\nPlease accept this small, humble letter.\nPlease keep your merciful glance on this insignificant soul.\nPlease allow me to remain forever as a speck of dust at your lotus feet.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nNandini Gop\neagerly waiting for your mercy."

We love you very much and are deeply grateful for all the efforts you make for us.\n\nYour affection, compassion, and caring nature for every single soul have deeply attracted my heart. I still remember the story of how you would chant the Hare Krishna Mahmantra even while uprooting wild grass in New Vrindavan, many, many years ago.\n\nI am very fond of your pravachans. The stories you narrate, the principles you illuminate, and the spiritual essence you reveal are truly life-changing. I vividly remember how, during the South India Yatra in rrangam, you described with such sweetness how r Viu Chittar attained perfection by lovingly preparing a flower garland for the Lord every day.\n\nYour pravachans also give me great hope � like your lecture during the last r Vrindavan Yatra, where you compassionately taught us that we should never become discouraged or morose, even if we make mistakes in our bhakti. You assured us that if we continue with full faith, progress is guaranteed.\n\nYour teachings also give completely new insights. For example, in this year�s yatra, you beautifully instructed us to let go of old animosities � even those carried for generations � and to chant the Hare Krishna kirtan together, just like the animals in the Jhrikhand forest. That teaching gave me a completely new outlook and helped me find solutions for many of life�s long-standing problems.\n\nYou also create such vivid pictures in your pravachans � from r Krishna-ll, from Rmyaa, from r Gaur-ll, and from the lives of great devotees � all of which have carved deep impressions in my consciousness. For instance, I remember your description of how all the Ayodhya-vss eagerly accompanied Bharata to bring back r Rama. Your narrations make these pastimes come alive before our eyes.\n\nI also fondly remember your endearing remark during the 2011 Prerana Festival � how you lovingly said that since you love India, and Indians love cricket, you too wanted India to win the World Cup. That simple, affectionate comment won all our hearts. From that moment, my interest in cricket disappeared, and my affection for you only grew deeper.\n\nThank you so much, Maharaj, for your tireless efforts, your limitless compassion, and � despite undergoing so many personal inconveniences � for still preaching and uplifting our lives.\n\nI sincerely pray to r r Rdh Gopinth that you always have good health and sufficient time for rest.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nriramya Krishna Ds."

    "Your Offering": "Dearest Guru Maharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances, all glories to Srila Prabhupada!\nI remember this time last year when I came to your vyasa puja for the first time. I had the deep desire in my heart to take shelter of you for a few months before that, for you to be my diksa guru, and that morning my authorities at Soho Street temple had given me their blessings to pursue that course - to become your initiated disciple.\nWhen I arrived at Krishna Avanti School that day for the vyasa puja I felt a little out of place, a little nervous, but also excited and relieved. Excited for what was to come in my spiritual life with you, and relieved that the deep desire in the core of my heart had been acknowledged and trusted by my authorities at ISKCON Soho. Sitting inside Krishna Avanti I felt a little unqualified to be amongst such exalted devotees, fully surrendered to serving you and Srila Prabhupada�s mission, but by the end of the day, I very much felt the warm bliss of being embraced by your representatives, my family, on returning �home�.\n\nIt�s funny, that day only a handful of names were pulled out of a hat to read their offerings to you. I was so new to all this at the time and I hadn�t written anything, and as I sat alongside Radhanath Swami�s disciples, I was a bit of a rabbit caught in the headlights. As they were pulling the second name out of the hat, I turned to Tripad Prabhu and said somewhat exasperatedly - �Prabhu, I haven�t written anything, please say they don�t pull my name - � at which point XANDER HEPHER (my name), boomed out across the room. Of all the possible names, and of the few that were selected at random, of course mine had been pulled out! I went up and read a small reflection I had written. It was actually such great mercy, and such great kindness. It was some reciprocation with my desire to please you and serve you, and in some sense it felt like confirmation that I was making the right decision. Thank you for always guiding me, and for always remaining with me.\n\nI still am the same uncertain individual in many ways, trying desperately to please yourself and the devotees I have the pleasure of associating with, but now, one year on, I have the great and inconceivable blessing of your eternal shelter. And so any anxieties and insufficiencies I possess are forgotten in the presence of your great mercy. Words cannot suffice to thank you for what you have done, and are doing in my life. From when I first met you last January in Govardhan Eco Village, to the present day, everything has changed. In meeting you for the first time I had my first tangible experience of what real love was, through your embrace outside Madan Mohan Temple, and through your encouragement. You have lived in my heart since then and I pray that my meditation on you may become deeper, clearer and more absorbed as I seek to purely and sincerely please yourself, Srila Prabhupada and all the Acaryas with my service. I will always try to represent you by being an example of your mood - to serve with utmost humility, honesty, and deep, deep care and compassion for all living entities. I will try, and do my utmost, to follow in your footsteps.\n\nSometimes I long for your personal association and wonder whether it is a sentimental desire or a desire of the heart to be more intimately serving you. But I know that the deepest intimacy is in serving your instruction, and that through being situated here in the West, you are pleased by my humble attempts to propagate Srila Prabhupada�s movement to the Western people, to the best of my ability. You said that Studio 108 is working because things are being done in a mood of pure devotion, and that we must maintain. Purity is the force and preaching is the essence, and so I will do my best to continue serving here in separation from you, as purely as I can, which means following your guidance, and your instruction. Then I can give others the opportunity to one day experience the love that you have given me.\n\nOn the day of my initiation, everything changed Guru Maharaj. As I walked onto the stage with my parents, my mother looked at me and said, �Go!�, gesturing towards you. I know out of the sensitivity and kindness of your heart you invited them on stage to give their blessings, and for me to offer them my heartfelt obeisances. My mother saying �Go!� towards you, felt very much as if she was willingly and lovingly handing me over to your shelter. They knelt behind me as I lay at your feet Maharaj - it was as though they offered me up to you, and I lay down at your feet. Lying at your feet is where I wish to remain. I cannot begin to express my gratitude for my parents being there, and for your kindness towards them. They gratefully received your words of appreciation on that day, thanking them for coming, and gratefully received the burfees and cookies you offered them. I feel more deeply connected to them under your shelter now, following that day that we all shared. My father says he would like to meet you to have a more personal discussion, and if that one day happens it would be so special. My mother loves you already.\n\nI only hope that for years to come I can please you more and more in service of Srila Prabhupada. That I may make you proud, and that I may become a representative of your mood and mission, wherever I may be.\n\nYour eternal servant,\nAnanda Nitai Dasa"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj, Please accept my humble obeisances!\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada!\nAll glories to you!\n\nMaharaj, bowing my head unto the sacred dust of your lotus feet, I pray that I may always remain grateful to you and to your dearest Srila Prabhupada.\n\nMaharaj, recently, as we were participating in this year�s Kartik Yatra, we visited the forest of Kamya Vana� and while there I was reading from Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita about the pastimes of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu coming to Sri Vrindavan Dham. While reading I came across a verse from CC Madhya 17.15, where Srila Prabhupada in the purport explains:\n\n�A disciple who has actual love for his spiritual master is endowed, by the blessings of the spiritual master, with all confidential knowledge.�\n\nAnd upon reading these lines, I reflected, how Srila Prabhupada out of great love for his Spiritual Master HDG Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura, took his instructions to his heart and preached to the people of western countries in the English Language and bestowed us with this gift of International Society of Krishna Consciousness.\n\nIf it wasn�t for Srila Prabhupada beginning his travel to the West in 1965, at the age of 69 years, and suffering 2 deadly heart attacks along with seasickness before reaching the shores of America; and later on struggling alone to preach the message of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu while staying in Lower East Side of New York City in its chilling winters, I would not have received this great fortune and benediction to practice Krishna Consciousness.\n\nAdopting this mood, and out of great love for Srila Prabhupada, your Spiritual Master, you have taken up his instructions to your heart and offered your entire life for fulfilling them.\n\nFor example, when Srila Prabhupada, during the final days of his earthly pastimes, was having very poor health, and was resting on a bed at Sri Sri Krsna Balarama Mandir, ISKCON Vrindavan. At that time, he gave his instructions to all of us:\n\n�Your love for me,� said rla Prabhupda, �will be shown by how much you cooperate to keep this institution together after I am gone.�\n\nTaking this instruction to heart, Maharaj, you have lived a life exemplifying how to cooperate with the devotees, how to become a humble and menial servant of all the devotees, and dealing with the devotees with love, and therefore you have always emphasized on developing the qualities of Gratitude, Humility, Tolerance, Selflessness, and rooting out the vices within our heart like False Pride, Arrogance, and False Ego. Maharaj, you have exemplified this in your life, and you are very much pleased with us when we try to serve in the mission of Srila Prabhupada in the same spirit and mood of being Servant of Servant of Servants to the best of our capacities.\n\nMaharaj, you have always cooperated with Srila Prabhupada by encouraging devotees to practice Krishna Consciousness and never leave his shelter. All these years you have taken great care to ensure that the devotees are happy while rendering services. Regarding this, recently your Godsister HG Malati Mataji was sharing -\n\nHH Radhanath Swami Maharaj has kept me inspired to continue practicing Krishna Consciousness despite all struggles in life after Srila Prabhupada had left this world to return back to Godhead.\n\nInspiring us through your classes, you always sharpened our consciousness and taught us not to serve inattentively and morosely, or doing services offered to us just for the sake of doing them. But you taught us to remain grateful despite all difficulties and reversals that may come while we render services and continue to serve, putting all our heart in it. You are pleased when we take shelter of Krishna and experience joy and happiness in serving Him�\n\nAlong with this, you have always taught us to associate with our guru through his V, as Srila Prabhupada would often instruct us on numerous occasions:\n\nThere are two words, v and vapu. Vn means words, and vapu means this physical body. So v is more important than the vapu. Vapu will be finished.\n\nAnd even though Maharaj, you met Srila Prabhupada only on a few occasions physically, but you have always associated with him through his V, as we have often heard you saying, �Just today morning I was hearing from Srila Prabhupada�� And hearing from Srila Prabhupada, you have taken to your heart many other instructions which were not even given to you personally�\n\nBe it the manifestation of Vrindavan forest on the altar of Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji, or Vrindavan Forest in the courtyard of ISKCON Chowpatty, or ISKCON GEV at Wada, all are manifestations of your surrender and love for the instruction of Srila Prabhupada of developing Vrindavan Forest and 7 temples given back in the 1970s at New Vrindavan!\n\nAs I was recently hearing from you during Kartik Yatra, you said:\n\nWe can make spiritual advancement and feel a true personal relationship with Srila Prabhupada and our gurus according to how we take his instructions personally � even if they were not given to us in physical proximity, even if they were given to us many years later. Srila Prabhupada was speaking to all of us.\n\nSo, although the instructions weren�t given personally to you, but you have taken the instructions of your Guru Maharaj personally out of great love for him and followed them wholeheartedly, and have encouraged and inspired all of us to do the same.\n\nMaharaj, I would love to beg and beg and forever be begging for this one quality of being a Great Lover of our Spiritual Master from you. As Prabhupada explained to us the commentary of rla rdhara Svm on verse SB 1.1.8:\n\nThe word snigdhasya means prema-vata. The word prema-vata indicates that one has great love for his spiritual master.\n\nI beg Their Lordships for this love for you, and to become Prema Vatah. Not just for the sake of saying it, but keeping personal comfort and lower nature and desires to enjoy senses aside, allowing this love for you to be manifested in the form of hearing from you daily and taking your instructions personally and following them wholeheartedly.\n\nMaharaj, I beg and desire to remain conscious and attentive in my daily practices of Sadhana (chanting and morning program), Sadachar, and Sewa. And be engaged in serving the devotees, serving Srila Prabhupada in the mood of servant of servant of servants, and serving the Lord�s holy name with attention and love, with the mood of being humbler than the blade of grass, tolerant like a tree, and offering all respect to others without expecting any respect for myself. Thus, being always grateful to the grace of Srila Prabhupada because of which I have gotten this opportunity to come to Krishna Consciousness, and to your grace and nectar of your V, because of which I am able to sustain.\n\nAnd Maharaj, in the same spirit that you stated in your Vyas Puja offering to Srila Prabhupada this year, I pray to simply become an instrument of your grace and compassion and serve all living entities who are suffering in this world by taking this sankirtan process very, very seriously in my life.\n\nThe world today is suffering from many problems. People, especially the youth, are addicted to so many varieties of things, be it intoxicants like alcohol, opium, and cigarettes, or ignorance in the form of sleep. They have practically surrendered all their consciousness to their mobile phones, watching reels on Instagram, shorts on YouTube.\n\nThe youth today is allowing all their good intelligence to be stolen by Maya, by falling prey to easily accessible, explicit, sexual, violent, and stimulating content on social media platforms, especially pornography. Even a moment of youth, when offered to the Lord, is glorified in scriptures, is being slaughtered and presented as an offering on the altar of Maya by Kali.\n\nMaharaj, I simply beg to become an instrument of your grace and compassion, and the compassion of Srila Prabhupada, and to assist my superiors and authorities like HG Radheshyama Prabhuji, HG Gauranga Prabhuji, HG Kanai Thakur Prabhuji, and HG Pankaj Gopa Prabhuji by becoming their servant to preach to the youth and show them the path back to Godhead.\n\nMaharaj, I am an unqualified person, and I am a rascal struggling to deal with these vices myself. I am fallen and addicted to my own lower nature, and I am unworthy of your mercy. Yet, I have a desire to offer my life, just like a little flower with a lifespan of only a few hours, unto your lotus feet.\n\nI pray to you so that I may realize my insignificant position and I humble myself in front of the orders of my superiors and, being submissive and surrendered to them, become an instrument in their hands.\n\nMaharaj, I beg your forgiveness for my shortcomings and sinful activities, knowingly or unknowingly committed, which cause your health to suffer. I promise you that I will overcome these shortcomings by receiving your grace through hearing from you and Srila Prabhupada, and surrendering to your orders and engaging in services with my full capacity.\n\nThank you very much!\nAspiring to become Servant of Your Servant\nPriyanshu"

Your compassion has shaped my journey in Bhakti in ways I am only now beginning to truly understand.\n\nYour Teachings and Compassion\nAs the years pass in Krishna consciousness, I am increasingly realizing that you are a perfect and exemplary master. During the Kartik Yatra 2025, I was deeply moved by your very first class, where you described�based on the teachings of our acharyas�Krishna�s return to Vrindavan after almost a century. By narrating this pastime and revealing the mood of parakya-bhva and love in separation, you opened a confidential doorway for all of us. Throughout the yatra, your references to the writings of the acharyas made me feel directly connected to them through you.\n\nHow I Experience Connection With You\nMany devotees ask how they can feel close to you without physically spending time with you. But in my own life, I have experienced a deep connection simply by rendering service, reading your books, and associating with devotees in the mood of servant of the servant. Every time I attempt to practice humility�even if only theoretically�I feel remembered by you.\n\nWhile studying Vilpa-kusum�jali by Srila Raghunath Das Goswami, I learned that the real mood of our Goswamis, even in their spiritual forms as manjaris, is to remain the servant of the servant. This mood allows them to relish the happiness that Srimati Radharani feels with Krishna. In the material world, closeness to the object of enjoyment gives pleasure. But in the spiritual world, the more we push others closer to Sri Krishna and situate ourselves as servants of all, the greater the bliss.\n\nEarlier I used to feel that by teaching us to be servant of servant you are giving us the qualification to return to Godhead. Now I understand that you are giving us something far greater�the qualification to enter the highest mellows of the spiritual world, following in the footsteps of our Goswamis.\n\nService in Jhansi and New Preaching Fields\nIt has now been almost a year since I shifted to ISKCON Jhansi, the place where Srila Prabhupada began his divine mission. Here I have experienced Srila Prabhupada�s mercy very tangibly. As you often say, whatever a pure devotee desires, Krishna personally makes it happen. We have seen this through the extraordinary preaching results here�especially in organizing Jhansi�s largest Janmashtami festival, where we wholeheartedly glorified Srila Prabhupada.\nRecently, we also began assisting with youth outreach in Philadelphia. Observing the mindset of people in the United States, I can clearly see how your seminars in the West and your universal principles perfectly address their needs and help nurture their spiritual growth.\n\nMy Prayer at Your Lotus Feet\nI pray that just as a night-lotus blossoms by taking shelter of the soothing moonlight, I may always take shelter of your guidance and protection while rendering any service in Bhakti.\n\nThank you, Guru Maharaj, for calling us to GEV Wada for this year�s Vyasa Puja. It is only by your kindness that I am able to progress even a little on this path.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nPriya Govinda Das\nISKCON Jhansi"

Sometimes we just chant fast so that we can complete some other pending works or chant some extra rounds, but when I heard you chanting, it was so, so soft, filled with love, devotion, and utterly calling out for Krsna.\n\nSrila Prabhupada mentioned that we should chant 16 good rounds, and that day, when I heard your chanting, I realized what is the meaning of chanting good rounds.\n\nIn your lectures, you always speak about humility, and truly, you are the embodiment of the \"Trinad api suni cena\" verse.\n\nWe usually think that for establishing relationships, we need to learn the regional language, but when I see the loving exchange between you and the Vrajavasis, that clearly shows that true relationship is established through love, and love is a matter of the heart, not language.\n\nAt the age of 75 also, you are showering your causeless mercy upon all of us, and to see you sitting on the vyasasan and giving lectures for continuously 3-4 hours, and then kirtan during Kartik Yatra to Sri Govardhan Dham, is really extraordinary. We all can see how dear and blessed you are by Srila Prabhupada & Sri Sri Radha Gopinath.\n\nI am really blessed to have you in my life.

This seva is given by my counselor, H.G. Mukund Anand Prabhu. Although I don't have any qualification to do the same, by following his order and as your mercy, a Guru prasad \"yasya prasado bhagvat prasado...\", I want to perform this seva. Please bless me, Maharaj, with your divine knowledge and the way you eloquently speak, seeking a tinge of this quality so that I can do some good to these children who join.\n\nApart from this, I am also conducting the Krishna Kridangan every Sunday, a weekly program where some children join. There, I speak on various pastimes of the Lord. Seeking your blessings to perform this activity in a humble state of mind.\n\nUnder the guidance of our counselor, we are reading Srila Prabhupada's books for half an hour every day. We call this SPORT (Srila Prabhupada Online Reading Terminus), where many devotees join and read. We started this program a long time back, and through this, I have completed all the small books. Now, we are reading Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 4. This is all happening due to your mercy, where I don't have any strength to do so.\n\nDear Maharaj, I am completely bowled out in my grihastha life, where my wife and I have not been talking to each other for the last 6 months. She doesn't cook for me, or you can say that I really don't want anything from what she cooks. It could be my own ego, where I also don't want to put my down, nor does she. I know I should talk to my counselor regarding the same but don't have the courage to do so. My own wish is also not to resolve the issues with my wife, but I want to perform all the responsibilities properly. You know everything. Please give me encouragement so that I can pass this phase, and she should understand my feelings about me.\n\nI do these things, but still, my heart is not satisfied doing japa and other devotional activities. But certainly, I am missing a big part. Where are these weeds growing Please show me the light to remove these weeds that are growing day by day.\n\nYour servant,\nAnanta Shesh Das"

Around 2 years back, I was a porn addict. I used to watch for hours, Maharaj. Even after coming to Bhakti, due to my past misdeeds, I was entangled in watching these things, Maharaj. Once I heard your lecture (recording of Chapaty temple). In that lecture, you explained about the crow mentality and how this sex enjoyment is not at all an enjoyment. Then a shift began, and I understood what this actually is. And as many times you said, we need to understand actually who we are, what is our actual identity. This point helped me to think that what I'm doing is completely wrong and does not give me real pleasure, Maharaj. Genuinely writing, I may have heard the same thing so many times by different respected devotees, but when you said it straight, it went into my heart and gave an actual impact. I remember this time in Kartik Yatra when you were narrating the pastimes that we may have heard numerous times, but still, when you narrated those pastimes, actually I heard every lecture at least twice, still want to hear them again. Maharaj, genuinely I have no words to thank you. Countless times I prayed at your lotus feet for protection from these desires. Every time you heard my prayers, and by your mercy, I was able to surpass these desires. I request, Maharaj, to always please keep me in your shelter. And Maharaj, I genuinely want to become your spiritual son, Maharaj. Kindly please accept me at your lotus feet and please give me some service opportunity if possible. I do not want to waste this life anymore.\n\nHare Krishna Maharaj dandwat pranam."

And I would like to beg Krsna for your good health and that you stay with us as long as possible, because I am very selfish, and so many people like me need you for our spiritual upliftment.\nNow, Maharaj, very recently, before this Govardhan Kartik yatra, I heard the audio \"Journey Home\" book directly in your holy voice. And this time it really touched my heart. Before, I also read it once, but long ago, maybe around 10 years before. But this time, when I heard it, every episode I was repeating at least twice.\nAnd after hearing about your journey, Maharaj, I was really thankful to Krsna that He sent you in this world just for delivering the fallen & unworthy souls like me. Otherwise, there was no other reason for you to come here in this world except for delivering us, Maharaj.\nHow dear you are to Krsna, people like us cannot even imagine. That's why I beg at your lotus feet, Maharaj, beg for your blessings so that this fallen soul also can do something, at least, to please you and to please your Krsna, because Krsna is your property. And it is really you only who can make us also experience Krsna in our life. I am such an unworthy & rebellious soul that I have no feelings for pleasing Krsna & His devotees. Rather, I take so much pleasure in finding faults in devotees and committing so many offenses towards Krsna & devotees. In such a fallen condition of mine, there is no hope for me except your divine grace.\nYou just came to deliver the fallen souls of this world, and I am not so humble that I can consider myself the most fallen, but in reality, I am. And in spite of being so, I am not ready to accept my actual situation of being so fallen. But your mercy is the only hope for me.\nAnd I have heard that the mercy of great souls like you is so powerful that it can very easily deliver the fallen souls like me.\nI am just trying to practice this process given by Srila Prabhupada and our glorious acharyas, just with this hope that someday I will also get the causeless mercy of Krsna coming through His sincere devotees like you, and then someday Krsna may use me also in any way He likes to use.\n\nNow, I am just a beggar at your lotus feet, Maharaj, a beggar for your causeless mercy. I have no sincerity, no qualification. The only thing is that I am just trying with my little efforts, and those also with no feelings, hoping for your causeless mercy someday.\n\nYour insignificant & fallen servant -\nshyam bhagwan das"

It is not something you teach just through your words�it is something you live every moment.\n\nI remember a simple yet unforgettable moment:\nI was standing alone in a corridor, and as you walked past, you paused for a second, looked at me gently, and nodded. That tiny gesture has stayed with me for life.\n\nAnother incident that left a deep impression on me was during a lift ride. I and some devotees were carrying a lot of boxes. When you came, any person of your position would expect the lift to be cleared for them. But without even a second�s thought, you quietly took the stairs, simply to not inconvenience us.\n\nThis single action taught more about humility than a thousand lectures could.\n\nI have also seen how, during Kartik Yatra, you express such genuine gratitude to the devotees doing background services�cooking, managing, arranging, cleaning, organizing. Even the smallest service, you glorify as if it is the greatest achievement. This has taught me to value every devotee, every task, every sacrifice. You make service feel sacred.\n\nYour devotee care is another quality that has inspired me. The way you strive for others, the way you acknowledge each devotee�s issues, the way you shower your love�this is the kind of compassion I want to cultivate in my own life.\n\nI pray for the strength to follow your teachings and to imbibe even a drop of your qualities.\nI pray for the courage to adopt a servant-leader attitude like yours, in my work, my responsibilities, and my relationships.\nI pray that I may always remain connected to the Vaishnavas and continue growing under the shelter of sincere devotees who follow your footsteps.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for giving the world an example of how soft the heart of a true saint is.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nAshutosh"

This year, we are more fortunate as you visited Baltimore ISKCON temple and we got good fortune to serve you lunch prasadam. Please forgive us if we have committed any offenses at your lotus feet while serving you.\n\nI was reading HG Vrindavan Das prabhuji�s �Guru Smaran� book where he mentioned many of his memories with you.\nIn one incident, he tells of your great quality of humbleness and always considering yourself as a servant of the servant of the Supreme Lord.\nOne time, a devotee family was talking to you in the temple. They also had a servant with them whom they brought from their village to help them in their household duties.\nYou asked them who she was, and they mentioned that she is their servant. Then you mentioned to them that you are her servant.\nHG Vrindavan Das prabhuji mentions through this incident your humbleness and always having the mood of a servant of the servant of the Supreme Lord.\n\nIn another incident, Prabhuji talks about your tolerance.\n1. Once, when Guru Maharaj went to Belgum, Vrindavan Das Pr arranged 5 programs in 1 day.\n2. In the morning, after the SB class was over, Guru Maharaj got up from the Vyasasana.\n3. Then Vrindavan Das Pr noticed blood marks on the Vyasasana and also similar marks on Guru Maharaj�s dhoti.\n4. Then he informed Maharaj about these blood marks.\n5. Then Maharaj pulled his dhoti a little and showed a big boil that had burst. Due to that, blood and pus came out.\n6. But Maharaj was so tolerant that he continued his SB class without any complaint.\n7. After that class, Vrindavan Das Pr took him to an Ayurvedic doctor who cleaned and applied a bandage. He also gave some medicine for the pain.\n8. Though Maharaj had this bodily issue, he still continued with preaching in all the other 4 programs.\nIt shows Maharaj�s tolerance and his enthusiasm or compassion to preach or share this wonderful knowledge with others.\n\nIn one more incident, he mentions about your absorption in Krishna Katha.\n1. One time, when Guru Maharaj was giving a lecture in one of the devotee�s bungalows, outside in the garden.\n2. His Vyasasana was arranged under a big mango tree and Maharaj started giving the lecture.\n3. At some point, a mango fell down from the tree onto the head of Guru Maharaj and bounced in front of the devotees.\n4. A few devotees rushed to take that mango fruit, considering it as Maha prasadam of Guru Maharaj.\n5. Within a few minutes, there was a bump on Maharaj�s head due to the mango fruit falling from 20 feet high onto his head.\n6. After the program was over, HG Vrindavan Das Pr mentioned to Guru Maharaj about the bump on his head.\n7. Then Maharaj asked him how it happened. Then Prabhuji narrated what happened.\n8. It shows Maharaj�s great absorption in Kirtan or Krishna Katha that he was not aware of the damage that had happened to his body.\n9. If a person like me, then I would be crying or shouting with pain. Mostly I would have cancelled the rest of the program also.\n\nHearing your glories from all these pastimes inspires me to progress in the path of Bhakti. I have many anarthas in my heart sitting very strongly and I am unable to control my mind from materialistic activities. Though I theoretically understand that if I don�t ignore my mind and don�t surrender to Guru & Krishna, then my miseries will continue birth after birth. But I am extremely weak in front of my mind.\n\nSo, on this auspicious occasion, I pray at your lotus feet to shower your mercy and blessings so that I can try to engage my mind sincerely in Krishna consciousness and develop Brahmanical qualities.\n\nAlso, we would like to thank you for everything that you have given to us and beg your prayers so that we will be able to serve your lotus feet and Srila Prabhupada�s mission.\n\nTrying to be your servant of servant,\nKrishna Venu Das & Jai Lalita Devi Dasi\nElkridge, Maryland, USA."

Our spiritual life has taken new turns after you have accepted us as your disciple.\nAfter 2020, I moved to my native place: Nangal in Punjab. It is a small town and there are no ISKCON centers. We were missing devotees and ISKCON programs badly. At times, we used to plan to shift back to Pune/Mumbai. However, after initiation, some miracles happened. A brahmacari started visiting a college nearby for preaching. It was a matter of great joy for us. And to add to our amazement, two devotee couples got posted in Nangal. This is nothing short of a miracle and it happened out of nowhere. Considering the limited job opportunities in Nangal, it is very rare that some devotees from Gurugram and other big cities get posted here. But by your and Krishna�s divine intervention; it happened. We felt as if you are arranging this for us, so that we feel sheltered and connected. Thanks Guru Maharaja.\nWe have now started a weekly house program at our place. We conducted a Vedic summer camp for kids in our society which was attended with great joy by 42 kids; and parents appreciated it.\nFor the first time in our town, we celebrated Radhashtami. It became a grand event with around 700 people coming. All these miracles are happening because of your blessings and mercy.

You have always been my role model, the person I look up to; you are my everything, my Dear Gurudev. All your love, care, and affection have always been my constant source of strength in difficult times.\nMy dear Gurudev, without you, I feel I can never render any service in the mission of Srila Prabhupad and also to the Lordship, because you are the source of inspiration for how to render service and in which mood to render service.\nYour embodiment of Srila Prabhupad's teachings has inspired me to cultivate a deeper sense of devotion, compassion, surrender, and service. Your kindness, patience, and guidance (Vani sang) have helped me navigate life's challenges, and I'm forever grateful and indebted to you.\nYou may not always be present physically, but by your Vani Sang, you are always there by my side in my tough times, guiding me and giving me a way to come out of everything and surrender more and more.\nYour smile, your compassion, and your guidance are treasures I cherish deeply. It always makes me realize how grateful I am to be your disciple. May I continue to absorb your teachings and serve with the same love, humility, and devotion that you exemplify.\nThank you, my dear Gurudev, for being my spiritual beacon, my shelter, my strength, and my everything.\nI am forever grateful to you.

    "Your Offering": "Dear Maharaj, \n\nThere's a famous quote which many of us young people love to cite: \"When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind.\"\n\nWhen I was a kid, in passively hearing your lectures with my parents (who are your dear disciples Radhacaran Prabhu and Ujjvala Sakhi Devi), one word always stood out: compassion. I did not know what it meant, but I could tell it meant a lot to you.\n\nIn your glorious 75 years on this planet, of which today I have spent 23 as a product of that same compassion � I know that compassion is something you not just speak of, but truly live. And by trying to follow your example, I know that one day even my mean self can begin to understand what compassion truly means.\n\nWhen a devotee was once almost crying for not being able to practice bhakti as much as they would like, you lovingly told them to just try and keep trying. You chose kind.\nWhen a simple village lady prayed for your blessings for an upcoming surgery in Hindi/Marathi, you not only understood but also deeply reciprocated to her in the best language possible. You chose kind.\nWhen people judged or mistreated you, you never said one bad word about them. And when people were not so nice to each other, you taught them how to love and respect. You chose kind.\nWhen managers for a new project could not make it work with each other, you told them to just meet ever so often and not even discuss any work. You chose kind.\nWhen someone once lost a lot of money for the society, you gave him a second chance - outvaluing the person beyond the possession or property. You chose kind.\nWhen given any opportunity to speak, you adjusted your language and manner so people can genuinely assimilate the teachings of our tradition. You chose kind.\nWhen your humility makes you uncomfortable at even the smallest of attention to yourself, you wrote your entire story just to help a whole world of seekers in their journey home to God and Guru. You chose kind.\nWhen guests were to come to GEV, instead of asking the captive audience to chant, you captivated your audience to come forward and sing on their own. You chose kind.\nWhen people thought to optimise for who is most important, you said that everyone who comes to Chowpatty is a VIP guest of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. You chose kind.\nWhen devotees pushed for pragmatism and scale, you had an eye for every little detail which is immeasurable by any scale. You chose kind.\nWhen others felt that donkeys serve no utility, you asked them to take care of them in your farm. You chose kind.\nAnd whenever a donkey like me makes an ass of himself and does not love and serve enough, you still tap his head and give him a hug. You choose kind.\n\nThank you Maharaj for teaching us how to be kind � for every time you chose to be kind, you were actually the most right. And in my aspiration to be a beneficiary of the compassion of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Srila Prabhupada and Your Holiness, I pray I always remember and do what is right � being kind.\n\nYour servant,\nMukund Hari"

The most recent is the Kartik Yatra at Govardhan. This is the mercy I await for the entire year. This year at Govardhan, by your causeless mercy, I was fortunate to assist in Mega Kitchen under the inspirational leadership of HG Gauranga P. I was assisting HG Ajit Mukund P for the pre-processing Seva, which begins very early in the morning at 2 AM. It is a life-memorable experience in assisting cooking Seva to receive the immense blessings & mercy of thousands of Vaishnavas from all around the world. I am very, very grateful to you for giving me this divine opportunity and eagerly await to continue this Seva for many more years to come!\nAnother blessing is the wonderful association I have received here in Damodardesh under the leadership of HG Sri Vallabha P. Here also, I am trying to assist HG Jai Govind P in kitchen Seva weekly. I try to go for the Seva most Sundays. And I am very excited to share the news that we are going to cook for almost 3500 devotees for the yearly most awaited Kirtana Rasa 2025 for three days: breakfast, lunch & dinner. So I seek your blessings and prayers so that we can serve in the proper mood!!\nAlso, I am part of the Bhakti Vriksha group of HG Vrajalilanath P, who is an amazing Vaishnava, where I try to assist in various services like cooking, doing kirtan, giving class, etc. Prabhuji has a very wonderful Bhakti Vriksha group where we celebrate various festivals. We have every Saturday morning Mangal Arati at different houses, and the biggest is the Damodar Arati, which was started by HH Jayapataka Swami here in Damodardesh. So, in every Kartik month, we reach out to thousands of houses and perform Damodar Arati. Recently, we had the grand finale of the Damodar month celebration, where more than 400 devotees came, and we had various cultural programs and amazing kirtans throughout from 6 PM to 10 PM. Also, I try to assist in our Damodardesh Yatras to various holy places in India. All these things I am able to receive only because of your causeless mercy, dear Gurudev, and I am very, very grateful for that!\nEvery day, I try to chant my rounds attentively, but somehow there is distraction due to various circumstances. Also, I am not consistent in reading Srimad Bhagavatam, so I seek your blessings so that I can do my sadhana very sincerely for the pleasure of you, Srila Prabhupada & Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Shyamsunder, and for my purification.\nMy sincere prayers for your good health, dear Gurudev, so that you continue your service to your dear spiritual master Srila Prabhupada & your dear Lordship Sri Sri Radha Gopinath.\nKindly forgive me for any mistakes or offenses I might have committed in performing the devotional service and seek your divine guidance in improving the quality of consciousness while performing devotional service.\nThank you very much for everything!!\nYour insignificant servant,\nAbhay Nitai das."

Although I had heard the philosophy of life, after hearing your lectures, I understood how to apply that philosophy in the association of Vaishnavas. I learned how we need to cultivate humility by cultivating genuine respect and appreciation for all Vaishnavas, at least beginning with those around us. Material life had made me a street dog who was barking foolishly at everyone. Your kind self became this dog's master and tamed me.\nAlthough I have never been in very close association with you, still I have felt much more the shelter of a Father, the love and care of a mother, and the encouragement of an elder brother from you. You became all in all for me instead of my blood family.\n\nGurudev, my turning point in my relationship with you was when I heard your life story in \"Journey Home\" from your own divine lotus mouth in the audiobook. After undergoing so much turmoil, you finally arrived in India, and then its heart, Vrindavan. You said you felt like you were at home, and then you loved this place more than any other place in this world. Gurudev, by hearing you, I felt Vrindavan has become my home as well.\nHearing the glories of Vrindavan and Nabadweep Dham and the pastimes of Sri Sri Radha Shyamsundar and Lord Chaitanya from you is my only lifesaving medicine. Your instruction to make chanting the topmost priority of my life has been the only cause I am still alive in Krsna Consciousness.\n\nThank you for accepting me officially as your servant as well on December 27, 2024, along with 344 devotees from Pune.\n\nGurudev, I am far from developing real, genuine love for the Divine Couple, but by your mercy, I can surely say serving Their lotus feet has become the only aspiration this servant carries in his heart, hoping to serve Them forever by assisting you and Srila Prabhupada.\n\nI will try my best to serve the mission of Srila Prabhupada in the mood of a servant of the servant till the end of this life and forever as well, just to please you.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nVilas Vardhan Das"

Please accept my humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet. \n\nMaharaj, on your 75th divine appearance day, as I begin to write something about you for the first time, I realize how insignificant I am to glorify you. Yet, for my own purification, I have tried to express something about you. If I have made any mistakes, please forgive me by your own merciful nature.\n\n _trnad api sunicena_\n _taror iva sahishnuna_\n _amanina manadena_\n _kirtaniyah sada harih_\n\nYou are truly the embodiment of this verse from the ikakam. The mission of spreading Sri Chaitanya Mahprabhu�s sakrtana movement all over the world, which Srila Prabhupada began, is being carried forward by you, Maharaj�his qualified son endowed with all the qualities of a pure Vaiava. Today, millions of people across various parts of the world are becoming enlightened by seeing you and receiving your teachings, and thus are embracing Krishna consciousness.\n\nMaharaj, you yourself are the living example of how a devotee should behave�not only toward Vaiavas but toward all living entities from the entire human race down to every creature.\n\nYour book *The Journey Home* can inspire any person in the world to overcome any situation in life. From your life�s journey, we can easily understand how one must keep unshakeable faith in the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, even while going through the most challenging circumstances.\n\nI am an insignificant, tiny soul. At a time in my life when I had completely lost direction, your quotation�\n *�Do not take this material world so seriously, because it is always changing. Something terrible that you take so seriously today is going to change tomorrow.�*\n�completely transformed my entire mindset.\n\nIt was after receiving your teachings and mercy that I joined ISKCON in 2018. From that very day, I accepted you within my heart as my Guru Maharaj, although I still feel that I have not yet developed the qualification to become the disciple of such a great, pure Vaiava like you.\n\nThe example of rendering wholehearted service to one�s spiritual master�and doing so very carefully for the fulfillment of his divine mission�is something we can easily understand from your deep affection and dedication to Srila Prabhupada, Srila Guru Maharaj.\n\nI could not have the fortune of seeing Sri Chaitanya Mahprabhu, but when I saw you dancing ecstatically in the Jagannath Ratha Yatra, my heart felt that desire fulfilled.\n\nYou are an ocean of unlimited divine qualities, Srila Guru Maharaj. I am extremely insignificant� The glories of your qualities and teachings can never be completely described. Through your teachings, you have become an ideal example for the entire human society all over the world.\n\nIn this vast ocean of material existence, drowning helplessly in Krishna�s illusory energy, I am an extremely insignificant soul. By your mercy, Maharaj, I have received the fortune of discovering a great and exalted personality like Srila Prabhupada. By your mercy, I have become able to understand the meaning of the scriptures that Srila Prabhupada has given us.\n\nMy only prayer to the Supreme Lord Krishna and to Srila Prabhupada is this: even if not in this lifetime, then in some lifetime, may I receive even a drop of your causeless mercy, Maharaj.\n\nAn insignificant beggar of your causeless mercy,\nArnab Dewan"

I\ncannot fully comprehend the depth of your mercy, yet even a small part of it has brought a new\nlife of devotion into my heart.\nBy your inspiration, I have come to see that surrender to Lord Krishna is not merely a ritual, but\na humble offering of the heart - free from personal motives, steady in faith, and grounded in the\nwish to please Him. Although my understanding is limited, your association has planted the\nseed of devotion within me, which continues to grow by your guidance.\nThrough your mercy, I have begun to experience bhakti, the eternal function of the soul - a\nnatural readiness to serve the Supreme Lord, not for reward, but out of love and humility. I know\nmy own limitations, yet your guidance has allowed me to hear the teachings of the Bhagavatam\nattentively, chant the holy names with care, and serve the devotees to the extent I can. These\nare blessings I cannot repay, and I remain deeply grateful.\nBy your example, I have also learned the meaning of compassion and respect for all living\nbeings.

I bow to this vision, knowing it comes entirely from the shelter of your lotus\nfeet.\nYou have inspired me to visit the holy dhamas - places where the Lord�s pastimes are eternally\nmanifest. With your guidance, I have had the privilege of walking in Vrindavan, Radha-kund,\nShyama-kund, the Krishna Balaram Mandir, Govardhan, Mayapur, and Jagannath Puri. These\npilgrimages have awakened humility in my heart.

Your ability to simplify complex spiritual concepts and make them accessible to all is a testament to your exceptional wisdom and dedication. Maharajji, Your teaching literally helped me at every step of my life. Whenever I feel lonely, stressed out, I watch your lectures on YouTube; it makes me happy and peaceful instantly. And one thing happens with me every time: wherever I get some question in my mind, like, \"What is it Why did it happen\" I instantly get your video recommendations on YouTube and I get my answers. I have also read your book in audiobook form, \"The Journey Home,\" from you, Maharajji, on the Iskcon Desire Tree website. My mind was completely shaken; it has become my inspiration even after so many challenges and so many obstacles you had faced, you never gave up. It's really a motivation for me. Now it's my second time listening to that audiobook. And also, there is the playlist of all your lectures on Iskcon Desire Tree. I have completed 40% of the lectures and will complete listening to all the lectures very soon.\n\nI like the concept of the good dog and bad dog that you wrote in that book. But Maharajji, my bad dog always dominates me, but I am trying hard for the dominance of the good dog. Also, you have said in that book that always serve everyone, always feed everyone, always love everyone. I am trying my level best, Maharajji, to implement it. And also in many of your lectures, you focused more on congregational chanting, and being always united with devotees, and always be in the mood of *trnad api sunichina*; that also I am trying to implement, but it's very difficult. As you said about congregational chanting, I had started chanting on Zoom Japa with HG. Anand Vrindavan Prabhuji, and by your mercy, Maharajji, due to that Zoom Japa, for the first time in my life, I have chanted 128 rounds on Nirjala Ekadashi. It's only happened, Maharajji, because of your mercy and guidance and blessings. As at that time, whenever my determination got low, I watched your lectures on YouTube, which gave me strength. Like that, there are so many new things I have learned from you, Maharajji. For that, so many, many, many, many thanks to you, Maharajji. I am very grateful for the opportunity to learn from you.\n\nYour teachings have not only enriched my spiritual journey but have also positively impacted my personal life. Your emphasis on love, compassion, and selflessness has inspired me to become a better version of myself. I am grateful for your patience, understanding, and guidance, which have helped me navigate life's challenges with greater ease and confidence.\n\nYou are incredibly inspiring, and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to connect with someone as remarkable as you, Maharajji. Your kindness, efforts, and encouragement truly meant a lot to me and made a meaningful difference.\n\nI bow to your lotus feet, dear Maharajji, and pray for your continued blessings and guidance on my spiritual path. I love you, Maharajji, so much. Your impact on my life has been immeasurable, and I am forever indebted to your kindness and wisdom. And I daily pray to Shri Shri Radha Gopinathji for one wish: that I want to meet you, and I have a guarantee that Gopinathji will fulfill it, as Gopinathji fulfills all my wishes. I am so excited and curious and very desperate to meet you, Maharajji, and I know Gopinathji will soon do that. We will meet soon, Maharajji.\nThank you once again, Maharajji, for everything.\nAnd one wish: It would be my heartfelt honor to serve you.

Both projects are beautiful manifestations springing from your heart; both are places that I consider my home.

There were years that I watched this documentary every day, just to be there in spirit with all of you. Now I was allowed to be there myself, and it exceeded all my expectations. Words cannot describe this glorious offering of you to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath� The depth of devotion, the joy of everyone present� by your desire, we are allowed to experience the spiritual world, and I deeply thank you for that.\n\nBy your mercy, I am serving our Sri Sri Radha Gopinath here in Radhadesh. Being on the altar with the whole Parampara present, it is very clear how you are the connection for me to this glorious disciplic succession. I do not deserve this service in any way, but the fact that I am there shows your level of compassion upon me� and I once again deeply thank you for that.\n\nHow can I repay my debt and reciprocate with your love I know it�s impossible, but let me try it anyway. Let me get up every morning and read and chant and give my best throughout each day, often failing but continuing anyway. Let me continue to serve this community, family, and friends and do my little part.

Ten first-year students were able to shift into VOICE. Our team of devotees made it possible by the grace of guru Parampara and Srila Prabhupada. This grace we have received because of you; your grace is our saviour.\n\nI have understood this much for sure: that you want each of your disciples to become a genuine, sincere devotee above all external achievements. That�s your only expectation from all your disciples. You want each one of us to be truly grateful to Srila Prabhupada and serve his mission with selflessness and gratitude.\n\nIn the Kartik Yatra at Govardhan, your lectures were very transforming for me. Your statement, �When we hear the vani of the spiritual master, then his vapu appears in our heart.�\n\nFor example, Narottam Das Thakur couldn�t see LC, Rupa, and Sanatan Goswami, but could develop such attachment to them, as expressed in his song \"Je anio�,\" was a striking example for me.\n\nMany pastimes that you narrated in the yatra, your gratitude and love to Srila Prabhupada, and your relationship with your Godbrothers/God-sisters were very inspiring for me, as this taught me very good lessons.\n\nI wish to be your genuine disciple, trying sincerely to follow your teachings. I want to hear your lectures every day, but due to my laziness and other shortcomings, I am not able to do so. Your lectures act as a compass for my consciousness, even amidst all external and internal turmoil.\n\nKindly bless me to serve you and your senior representatives with all my heart and soul.\n\nYour Servant,\nPrahlad Pran Das\nISKCON NVCC"

Sometimes we manage to seize the day and remain dedicated to the mission of Srila Prabhupada, but most often, covered by the illusory energy, we allow time to steal from us the precious moments of Krishna consciousness.\n\nIt feels as if yesterday was last year�s Vyasa-puja, when we prayed for health, mercy, and love for our most beloved Gurudev.\n\nMeanwhile, a lot of water has passed through Mother Ganga, and many events have passed through our lives as well. The question of whether we have been better than last year, and whether we are becoming more firmly grounded in Krishna consciousness, will hover constantly � chasing us just as time mercilessly pushes us toward yet another old age, toward yet another departure from this body�\n\nThe only light in these conditioned lives of ours � in which we mostly struggle with our own selves � is you, dear Gurudev. Our last meeting with you has kept me for long in an euphoric, transcendental mood. But as time (that terrible enemy of the devotees) passes, the memories slowly fade, and with them the energy we captured from your presence.\n\nThe new times we live in have taken a lot from us, but also have given us a lot. They have given us the opportunity to always be online with you, to hear your transcendental talks, through which again and again you bring us back to the right path � the path toward home, a path on which without your guidance we cannot go far.\n\nJust as Krishna�s calves unconditionally followed Krishna through good and bad, fulfilling all His instructions, so I, the most fallen of your disciples, try to follow your instructions and try to steal at least a small smile of satisfaction from you. The reward of Krishna�s calves for their service is eternal; time can do nothing to them, and again and again � untouched by forgetfulness � they delight in loving service to Krishna. Immersed in their pure love for their Govinda, they receive the mercy to be far from duality, change, and the fleeting nature of this miserable material world.\n\nHappy that I have you as my guiding (Vaikuntha) star, I celebrate this auspicious day � Vyasa-puja, because for me, Gurudev, you are my Krishna; you are the only light that protects me in the darkness of Kali-yuga and the burdens of everyday material life. Continue to lead us, help us, and be our guide on this unique journey home. Without you we are lost, condemned to defeat by the illusory energy.\n\nI wish you everything that can be wished for the dearest person in this life � love, service, best disciples, companionship with Krishna, health, and the eternal smile on your beautiful face that again and again gives us strength and energy to remain in Krishna consciousness.\n\nPlease protect and guide us in the best way you know and can. For me, all that remains is to give my life to this beautiful mission of Srila Prabhupada and to pray again and again for eternal service to you, dear Gurudev, amidst the claws of this material world which only you make transcendental. It does not matter where we may be in service � only keep us within it.\n\nThe time is short and precious. I will try to make him my best friend serving your lotus feet.\nI surrender them and rejoice in every new opportunity for service.

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Dear Guru Maharaja\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga!\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n\nAgain, one more year has passed, and I feel so much that I am far away from the expectations of You, Vaishnavas, and The Supreme Lord who has instructed in Bhagavad-gita, and whose heart is revealed in Chaitanya Charitamrita by Krishnadas Goswami Maharaja. I am very grateful to You for accepting me, though with so many shortcomings, conditionings, and immaturity in dealings. But You have given me a chance to be with the devotees and learn and try to serve as best as I can. I have been given the best of Deities, association of devotees, and especially Senior Gurus/Vaishnavas, the best quality of prasadam, Srila Prabhupada Books to read, profound and deep classes, engagements in sevas as per my interest and nature, all facilities required to stay in ashram, and much more which I do not deserve. Daily, I try my best to hear Your classes, which are like a beacon light to a wandering soul like me to fix my goal and have the right aspiration, and they give proper guidance of the process to reach the goal in very practical steps.\n\nThis year was very memorable as I got the chance to serve for Kartik yatra accommodation, for which to go to Govardhan in chilled winter and hottest summer. Before starting the seva, we had the opportunity to get Your blessings in GEV by the sincere endeavors of HG Sundarvar Prabhuji. We had surveyed and concluded that at max we could have 6000 accommodations in Govardhan, but by Your blessings, we realized that we were able to approach till 8500, and later we completed the target of 10000, though some accommodations were not up to the mark. This accommodation seva of Kartik yatra has been given since 2011, and though there were challenges and ups and downs, it is only by Your mercy that I have been able to carry on. Though by nature I am very introverted and to deal with new people, especially hotel persons, is not easy, still, devotees are allowing me to carry on. Also, in Pune, I am in the safe shelter of Your disciples, HG Radheshyam Prabhuji, HG Sundarshyam Prabhuji, HG Revati Pati Prabhuji, and HG Anatardwip Prabhuji, and many more. Hearing from them and observing their lives, mood, and mission gives Your remembrance.\n\nDuring the yatra, I could see how a sadhu's life should be, as You did not stay in that bungalow as You said its opulence is like that of Lord Indra, and You just accepted a simple room like other brahmacharis, and never You used the lift to go to the second floor, though in a day, You had to come and go at least 3-4 times. Also, in the morning, You did not take the van to go to the pandal. You gave Yourself almost 5 hours daily, including Your classes and Japa time, to all the disciples during the yatra, which is the greatest boon to all disciples. Also, Your visit to all the places was so much encouragement to all the serving devotees in different departments.\n\nOn this most auspicious occasion of Your 75th Vyasapuja, Guru Maharaja, I pray to Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Vrindavanchandra, Jagannath Baladev Subhadra, and Sri Sri Gaura Nitai to shower Their glance and mercy on You so that Your health remains well and You continue in delivering so many souls towards the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath.\n\nPlease forgive me for all my offenses and shortcomings in my sevas, and I seek Your mercy that I do not waste time and energy, rather use them to serve all devotees and overcome my selfish desires which are taking me away from the association of devotees.\n\nYour servant,\nSachinandan Bhagavan das\nISKCON NVCC Pune."

Thank you very much.\n\nIn fact, during the recent Kartik yatra, I really wanted to talk to you, to tell you what was going on in my mind, either in writing or orally. But since there are thousands of devotees, I was thinking it is very difficult for you to give time to everybody. I thought that Guru Maharaja was talking and giving instructions to everyone through his lectures. I was listening to each and every one of your beautiful lectures very, very attentively, forgetting all other things. I just kept looking at you. I was also praying for you in my mind. May my Guru live a long and healthy life and may he save the entire world.\n\nGuru Maharaja, I have only one wish, one request. In this birth, I want to go to Goloka. Because this world is a place of suffering. I am not qualified to go to Goloka. My only qualification is that I am your disciple. Therefore, by your grace, I can go. Guru Maharaja, please bless me, your daughter.\n\nAfter the Kartik yatra, we came to Vrindavan for four days. There I got to hear your Gopashtami lecture, sitting very close to you. The next day, by the grace of the Lord, I got the opportunity to sit near you in Prabhupada House and chant. I was seeing the expressions on your face. My heart was dancing with joy. You are in my heart. I was talking to you from the heart. I felt that you understood me. This is the Lord's special grace on me because I am seeing my Guru Maharaja so closely.\n\nAfter a while, it was time to clean up and everyone had to get up. Guru Maharaja, you were passing very close. I was standing on one side. You looked toward me and you stopped. You smiled at me, and with wide eyes, slowly said \"Haribol\". My joy was unbounded. What great power in those two words! You understood my heart. You blessed me. You took away all my faults. My sins were destroyed. You bathed me and made me holy with the nectar of your words. Your eyes were filled with grace, compassion, and blessings. When you left, I bowed down. I also prayed for the devotees of Latur. I was very happy because my Guru Maharaja looked at me with love. Thank you very much, Maharaja. You understood my desire from the heart. I am blessed. Every morning, as soon as I wake up, I embrace your lotus feet and pray to God for you from my heart, wishing you long life.\n\nYour humble daughter and disciple,\nMalini Devi dasi"

I have experienced all these divine qualities through your association.\n1) Humility and Tolerance\nIn every lecture, you always put more stress on humility and tolerance � td api suncena� Frankly speaking, I am trying to adopt this quality when I hear your lectures, but I am so conditioned that with whatever intensity I decide to adopt it, after a few minutes I forget everything and again come back to my original nature. I know it�s impossible without the mercy of Guru and Gauranga. Maharaj, please bless me so that I can follow this instruction of yours in my life.\n2) Ability to Harmonize Differences Among People\nDear Guru Maharaj, in Kartik yatra, there are thousands of devotees coming and staying together, and you always start your lecture by expressing your gratitude for each one of them. All these devotees are coming from different parts of the world; each one is very unique. There are so many differences among them, still, you appreciate everyone and harmonize among them. They may be disciples of HDG Srila Prabhupad or may be the most fallen conditioned souls like me. You are that magician who can manage the yatra for thousands of devotees under one roof. Otherwise, in Kaliyuga, a family cannot stay peacefully under a roof. Just because you have this divine quality of harmonizing among the people, you can do it. Everyone forgets their own desires and just tries to serve in the yatra. What a divine, satisfying, and blissful experience it is!\n3) Profound Compassion for All Living Beings\nDear Guru Maharaj, I still remember the first day�your first compassionate glance at me in 2012, when I saw you for the first time in a program outside NVCC. Due to your deep compassion towards the most fallen conditioned souls, I could enter into this path of bhakti and could walk on this path until now. The same compassion I experienced during our initiation last year in Dec 2024. �Thank you� is a very small word to express my gratitude towards you. We are eternally grateful to you for accepting us as your disciples, Guru Maharaj. Please bless us so that we can keep our vows throughout our lives that we took at the time of initiation.\n4) Deep-Seated Positivity\nDear Guru Maharaj, when I was reading �Journey Home,� I saw how you were taking positive things from every situation you have gone through. You are always telling: �Your experience will depend on how you interpret the situation.� Please Guru Maharaj, bestow mercy upon me to get a drop of this quality of yours.\n5) Forgiveness\nThis is a very divine quality which helps us to progress in our spiritual path. But I am struggling hard to inculcate this quality. Dear Guru Maharaj, please bless me so that I can develop this quality and make progress in devotional service.\nMaharaj, you are an ocean of many such divine qualities, but what can I express with my limited intelligence and knowledge Finally, my sincere prayers at your lotus feet to give me strength to be a good disciple of yours and follow your instructions so that due to my dealings and behavior, I will not hurt anyone in this world.\nThank you Guru Maharaj for everything.\nMy sincere prayers at the lotus feet of r r Rdh Vrindvan Chandra, r r Jagannth Baladeva Subhadr Miy, r r Gaura-Nitai, and rla Prabhupda for your good health.\nYour insignificant Servant,\nSuvarnamayi Gaurangi Devi Dasi"

Thank you, Gurumahraj, for descending on this earth to deliver the fallen souls like me and drag us out from the darkest well of this material world. There were many challenges, especially after the departure of Srila Prabhupada from this material world. But you never compromised in your mission to serve Srila Prabhupada. You have always been loyal and faithful to Srila Prabhupada and his mission. You always stress this point: that we should always be loyal and faithful to Srila Prabhupada. You teach by your example.\n\nIn SB 11.9.29, it is said: *labdhv su-durlabham ida bahu-sambhavnte mnuyam artha-dam anityam apha dhra*. After many, many births, one achieves this very, very rare human form, and this human form gives the opportunity to perfect one's life by practicing devotional service. Without devotional service, there is no meaning to human life, and there is no difference between a human being and an animal. The same sense gratification is there for all the species of life. I am very grateful to you for giving the life of devotional service. I don�t deserve it, but you showed your merciful glance on me and accepted me under your shelter. I am eternally indebted to you. At times, I wonder what I did to deserve such causeless mercy.\n\nOne of the most important instructions that you emphasize is to be very attentive in chanting and to make this a priority. You emphasize that one should cultivate menial service and a humble attitude. This humble attitude makes our chanting and service pleasing to Krishna. You say humility is not a detail of devotional service; it is the core and a very integral part of devotional service. We see that in many of your lectures, you always quote the �Trinad api sunichena� verse. You are the personification of humility. We see that even at this age, you make a point to come to Japa early in the morning and inspire all the devotees around you. Most of the time, I fall short in doing attentive chanting. With immense faith in your instruction, Guru Maharaj, and with your mercy, I promise to make chanting my priority. You also emphasize cultivating eagerness to do devotional service enthusiastically and read Srila Prabhupada's books. Once, after the program in Stanford, I was driving you to HG Vaisesika Prabhu's home. I asked if there was any instruction for me. You said, �Always practice Sadachar; always have an ethical and good conduct, and specifically in how one is interacting with other people.� I surrender to you and beg for mercy so that I can follow these instructions diligently.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I beg forgiveness for our countless offenses. I beg for your blessings so that we can serve in Srila Prabhupada�s Sankirtan movement and please HG Vaisesika Prabhu and HG Nirakula Mataji. Please let me always remain safe in the shelter of your lotus feet. Wishing you all good health for many years to come so that you inspire many souls to take to Krishna Consciousness.\n\nYour Servant,\nSri Gopal Das"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisance.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n\nMaharaj, I was almost in my eighth month of pregnancy when I came to know that my name was on the list for Brahmin Initiation, this was in April 2023. I was totally surprised and felt a bit nervous at the same time. I never expected this, especially during my pregnancy. After I got to know this, I sat silently in one place, thinking about this mercy flowing my way. I suddenly realized strongly from within that maybe it's not me; it is the soul within who is the actual recipient of this special mercy. My heart again and again kept saying the same thing: \"Or else, why would this moment come during my pregnancy\" I also had a strong desire to visit GEV throughout my pregnancy, but my husband said the roads were bumpy, making it difficult to go. But when this Initiation news came, my desire to visit Vrindavan and Govardhan got fulfilled.\n\nMaharaj, when I entered your room for the Initiation, you smiled, looking at me with so much motherly affection and concern. You also asked me about my well-being and if I would like to sit on a chair. Those words filled with love and concern moved me completely. After the Initiation, my heart and the baby within were dancing with happiness, and my eyes were filled with tears of joy and contentment from meeting you personally, which I never expected. Thank you, Gurudev. Later, you named my baby girl Yamuna, and we all desperately wanted this name for her. During the day of her Annaprashan ceremony at Radhagopinath temple, we got to know that you were at GEV, so we were waiting for Baldev prabhu to feed her mahaprasad kheer. Suddenly, Baldev prabhu informed us that Maharaj was reaching the temple in five minutes, so we should be ready. We immediately arranged for the kheer, and you personally fed it to little Yamuna with so much love. We were all surprised by this reciprocation from you with little Yamuna. Also, during the Kartik yatra at Govardhan, she was just 1.5 years old, and while I was standing outside the pandal at the end, I asked her where Guru Maharaj was, and she perfectly recognized him by pointing at the stage. Maharaj, since she was five months old, she started recognizing you from your photograph, and this also surprised us a lot. Thank you, Maharaj, for the showers of mercy upon little Yamuna and upon all of us.\n\nMaharaj, the compassion that you have for all living beings is what touches me the most. No matter whether the person is a known or unknown friend, or someone you are meeting for the first time, you always deal with everyone with compassion and kindness, which is so exemplary. On this auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, I beg you to give me shelter at your lotus feet always, irrespective of all the shortcomings that I am struggling with. Also, please bless me so that I can chant the holy names with love and attention, and can give up all the anarthas within and can remain grateful for all that I have. I sincerely beg forgiveness for all my anarthas and sins which I have committed and feel eternally indebted to you for accepting me as your disciple.

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet.\nSrila Prabhupada ki Jay.\n\nMaharaj, we recently attended the Govardhan Yatra. It was a very blissful experience in many ways. Being in the holy dham, listening to your nectarine lectures and those of other devotees, and visiting so many sacred places filled my heart with gratitude. There were challenges too, as there always are, but every challenge brings new learnings.\n\nBy your blessings, I am trying to gain a little more wisdom, though I remain very lowly and incapable of improving on my anarthas and mistakes. I am a slow learner, still trying to serve my duties at home, in society, and in the temple. Yet, because of my limitations, I often struggle with anarthas interfering in my duties and service.\nI try to stay connected by reading a few verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam daily. These teachings are such a great shelter for someone like me who faces many challenges in improving. I am trying to imbibe some of these lessons � to continue chanting seriously, continue doing services in the temple, continue serving my family, and continue helping the community in whatever small ways I can. More importantly, I pray that somehow I may also serve you directly, in a way that pleases you.\nIn family life, something or the other keeps happening, giving excuses for not meeting the expected standards. Life teaches many lessons every day. I just pray that I learn the right lessons and live my life with sincerity, gratitude, and dedication to you � to your words and teachings � fully absorbed.\nI am trying to improve my dealings, behaviour, and practices, but many times I see that I am not capable of doing everything on my own. I can only put some effort, but to overcome my shortcomings, I definitely need your blessings. To render any meaningful service, I need your empowerment so that I may serve in the way you would want me to serve. If I can please you even in a small way through my practices, behaviour, and services, that will be my success.\nMaharaj, I especially beg for your blessings so that I may chant the holy name sincerely, with complete absorption, with my heart focused on pleasing you, Srila Prabhupada, the Lord, Srimati Radharani. I pray that my chanting becomes more and more focused, attentive, and filled with genuine feeling � not mechanical, not distracted � but offered as a small attempt to serve Their Lordships. Only by your mercy can I develop such sincerity and determination.\nThere are many priorities in life, and I pray that everything is arranged properly so that I can serve with the right attitude and right consciousness � treating others fairly, caring for my family, serving the larger community, and at the end of life feeling satisfied that I have served the devotees and the mission with proper gratitude and a humble heart, as your insignificant servant.\nI pray that all family members continue to stay engaged in good health and consciousness, and advance, so that we develop the right mood of service and devotion, as you would expect from us.\n\nMaharaj, we sincerely pray for your good health, constant inspiration, and blessings through your words to us and many millions of souls for many more decades through your personal association. You are so dear to Krishna, Radharani, and Srila Prabhupada, and as your servant, my family prays for your blessings upon us and inspiration on many millions of souls.\n\nYour servants,\nSanatan Gopal Das\nRadha Sangini devi dasi\nDhruva\nRadhika"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nI am in deep thought, probably too much. I was reminded by the story of you sitting on that rock on the verge of the river Ganges. You decided to meditate in deep and contemplative prayer for a considerable time. While you were looking for a relationship and deeper purpose with God, I wonder now: were you wrestling with this same question of how deep the purification must go\n\nI sometimes feel like I am that being from the Beatles' Yellow Submarine. He's a real nowhere man - existing but not fully present, creating but disconnected from the creation, contemplating endlessly without resolution.\n\n�In the Beatles' animated film Yellow Submarine, the song \"Nowhere Man\" is performed by the Beatles as they encounter the character Jeremy Hillary Boob Ph.D. in the \"Sea of Nothing,\" also known as \"Nowhere Land.\" The lyrics, \"He's a real Nowhere Man, Sitting in his Nowhere Land, Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody,\" are sung about Jeremy, who lives in isolation and is described as a \"nowhere man\" due to his lack of direction and purpose. Jeremy is portrayed as an eccentric, flamboyant being with a blue face, pink ears, and a fluffy tail, who speaks mostly in rhyme and is deeply engrossed in creating art and writing books, though he claims never to read his own reviews. The song was originally written by John Lennon for the Rubber Soul album in 1965 and later featured in the film, where it serves as a thematic introduction to Jeremy's character. The character's name, Jeremy Hillary Boob Ph.D., is a whimsical creation that reflects the song's theme of existential detachment.�\n\nAs Krishna conscious as I try to be, and for many years, I have for quite some time been looking at what my mind and intelligence are doing and what Krishna and you have been trying to guide me into. As you know, I have always had a strong calling to fulfill instructions given to me years ago to serve in devotee care. In doing so, I have taken it upon myself to study deeper the aspects of our mind and body and what causes us to become triggered. I have even written a book about it, and it is currently being reviewed. I have received encouraging feedback.\n\nThese internal dives are necessary. I am drawn now to the thoughts and emotions you may have experienced while sitting on that rock overlooking the Ganges, day after day. At that time, I believe you must have been asking in so many ways: who is God and what is my purpose\n\nI too am asking now: how deep do Krishna and you wish to take me What have I done to end up in this position I know I have committed all kinds of sins and offenses, and yet here I am. The discovery and purification are both enlightening and challenging, where I must pull myself into focus as to what is rising to the surface and what is being revealed, avoiding traps of illusion and the blind spots that I, devotees, and the wider society have been subjected to. It seems ongoing because I have wanted to uncover this. However, I am too naive and feel very much like a neophyte devotee because I do not consider myself so learned in the sastras. I do feel like I have understood the essence of Krishna consciousness, though. I am perhaps running before I can walk, though as I present at the end, I have felt an increasing urgency to deepen my prayers and help myself and devotees avoid the pitfalls of the mind and senses further. In doing so, I am hoping we will be able to strengthen our ability to avoid offenses and serve as Srila Prabhupada wanted us to do in his instructions and writings.\n\nIt may be questioned why a devotee is put into such tribulation by the Personality of Godhead. The answer is that this kind of arrangement by the Lord is just like a father sometimes becoming unkind to his sons. Please read this section to the end - Krsna Book Ch 88 - The Deliverance of Lord Siva.\n\nAs devotees, we are covered in our awakening.\nEarly on, not long after joining the movement, I understood you, other sannyasis, and great surrendered souls go through so much purification. Some may think that your life in this world is floating on a cloud with an entourage of disciple followers and well-wishers.\nThough I know for you it's more about having to tolerate and endure all the attention. All eyes are on you, and so many expectations are made upon you. On one level, you have perfected life, and that is what we are all aiming for, to follow in your footsteps, but to live the life that you do, I believe I have many more lives to attain such Krishna consciousness.\n\nI don't fully realize, Maharaj, what you go through, and yet I know you have endured limiting and ongoing health issues. And it's that sixth portion of our karma that often rings in the back of my mind that you take on board from each disciple, and you have so many disciples.\n\nMaharaj, you've seen it all before, and the Vietnam war draft. As you are aware, the world governments have put out alerts that there may be a third world war. They are goading it to happen, of course. It is inevitable, as these are reactions to the accumulative reactions to animal slaughter.\n\nThis external chaos mirrors something of the internal work required. Thankfully, I understand the medical aspects of brain fog, which causes these deep and challenging thoughts and emotions. So, this is both an existential battle and a biological reality happening simultaneously. The two are not separate; the purification process operates through both channels. Therefore, I am not going to get overly alarmed, though it has been lack of sleep over years that has intensified it and the stress that comes from it.\n\nWhat do you do, Maharaj, when all these emotions rise to the surface and feel overwhelming Perhaps I may be answering my own question as to what you'd say And that is to take continued shelter of Krishna and the holy name.\nThat I'm doing, Maharaj. But I am putting into writing what I truly need: would you watch over me and help me navigate this period where the biological and spiritual purification are converging so intensely I'm not a nowhere man, though it feels that way when the world seems so cruel and the internal work so demanding.\nThis might not be the place to present such details, though these are grave concerns I have for the position of the movement right now and my service, and what I should best direct myself in.\n\nMy heartfelt prayers for your extensive services to gloriously continue and for the care and support for your good health.\n\nYour servant,\nChaitanya Jivan Das"

We cannot imagine our good fortune that such a senior disciple of yours, who is so elevated and so busy, will spend time with insignificant souls like us. We are so grateful to him and humbled by his behavior. Thank you so much, Maharaj, for building a loving and caring community of devotees.\n\nRecently, I was listening to HG Vraj Bihari Prabhu's lecture, and he was mentioning that listening to lectures or key points from a Guru's lecture is more important than listening to the pastimes of the Guru.

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Maharaj,\nPlease accept my most humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet.\nAll glories to your compassionate and saintly presence.\n\nMaharaj, you are truly an unfathomable ocean of mercy. Your life is a shining beacon for the entire world. Every aspect of your character�your humility, compassion, dedication, tolerance, and unwavering faith�melts our hearts and uplifts our consciousness. Your relentless journey in search of the Absolute Truth is not merely a story; it is a living scripture that inspires, motivates, and gives hope to thousands.\n\nIn New Vrindavan, you performed every service alone, worshipped the Deities with such devotion, and maintained spiritual discipline in the harshest conditions. Bathing multiple times in freezing temperatures without any facility for hot water�when the climate was minus four degrees�is unimaginable for us. Yet you accepted everything as the Lord�s arrangement and served without a single complaint. Only someone with love as deep as the ocean and surrender as pure as gold could live like this.\n\nSrila Prabhupada once said that you have descended from the spiritual sky to assist him. Indeed, Maharaj, again and again we feel that you are not an ordinary person. At this age, to sit for long hours without moving, absorbed in service and compassion�that itself is an extraordinary expression of divine empowerment.\n\nMaharaj, we are eternally grateful for everything you have manifested for the upliftment of souls. Your visionary counselor system has become a pillar of spiritual life for so many of us. Through this system, we feel protected, guided, encouraged, and lovingly nurtured. Your senior disciples carry your mood with such purity and sincerity that we naturally feel connected to your mission and become more steady in Krishna consciousness.\n\nWe offer our heartfelt gratitude for Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Barsana Eye Camps, the annual Kartik Yatra, and the transcendental Govardhan Ecovillage. Each of these projects reflects your unlimited compassion and tireless efforts to serve humanity. GEV is not merely a replica of Vrindavan�its atmosphere, devotion, and purity make us feel as though we are standing in the actual dham. It nourishes our hearts and gives us a deep spiritual experience every time we visit.\n\nMaharaj, your qualities are countless�this lifetime is far too short to describe even a fraction of them. Every word you speak becomes a guiding principle for us. Every action of yours becomes a lesson. When you dance in kirtan, it reminds us of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Himself. Your one glance fills our hearts with joy, strength, faith, eagerness, and a profound sense of shelter.\n\nI have no qualification, yet I have received your causeless mercy. This is my greatest fortune. Thank you for accepting me despite my many anarthas. Your shelter is my life�s greatest treasure. I pray that I may always follow your instructions sincerely and live in a way that pleases you.\n\nWe fervently pray to the Lord to bless you with strong health, long life, and unlimited strength so that you may continue to enlighten the whole world with Krishna-prema through your nectarean teachings.\n\nMaharaj, please bless me that I may carry your mood and mission forward without any ulterior motives�only with sincerity, humility, and devotion.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nBhakti Lila Devi Dasi"

We knew very well that we, being ignorant persons, do not have any qualification to glorify your wonderful qualities. But still, your favourite verse\n�Trinadapi Sunichena\nTaroriva Sahisnuna\nAmanina Manadena\nKirtaneeya Sada Harih�\nwhich always emphasizes a devotee�s mood reminds us to be always humble, even while chanting the holy name. This particular instruction, which we have been hearing from you, has a significant impact on our lives. You are the embodiment of this very quality recommended by Lord Chaitanya. Then, maintaining loving relationships with the devotee community, and also your affectionate dealings with your God Brothers and God Sisters, are always an inspiration for us. Since ravaam is considered the topmost process of the nine devotional processes, you have been very kind to shower your mercy by way of giving morning SB classes, as well as Sunday feast and festival classes, describing Krishna Katha and Krishna�s pastimes to us, and thus making us very fortunate to come out of the shackles of this material bondage. Annual Kartik Yatra to Brindavan, Mayapur Dhams, and other holy places is another benediction given to us to take the association of so many devotees from all around the world and taking part in various services during Yatra. This gives us a lot of insight into developing cooperation, loving relationships, and support among the devotees to make this Krishna Consciousness movement stronger, as desired by HDG Srila Prabhupada. Through your classes during Kartik Yatra, you have given us the most vital inputs and knowledge about the significance and various pastimes of the Lord and His devotees associated with those holy places. We express our profound gratitude for your affection and for providing us with ample opportunities for serving the devotee community as well as the general public through congregational preaching and especially during the Srila Prabhupada book distribution marathon. Had we not come into contact with ISKCON and Radha Gopinath Mandir, we would have been surrounded by complete ignorance and attached to material pleasures. You are our Spiritual Master, and being the representative of the Supreme Lord, you gave us the benediction for taking shelter at your lotus feet, which ultimately gives us the scope to take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna also, and thus making us so fortunate. I am personally indebted to you for a service which I got to carry out daily. I never expected this in my life.\n\nYour wonderful teachings helped us to overcome challenges, and we hope and aspire for serving this holy mission in the coming years also. We reaffirm our commitment once again and pray for your mercy that we live up to your instructions.\n\nWe express our renewed dedication to our assigned services, chanting the Holy Names, studying recommended scriptures, and cooperating with other devotees to further the mission.\n\nPlease bless us to always reflect an understanding of your mission, i.e., spreading the message of Lord Chaitanya, and a sincere desire to assist in that mission.\nWe express our heartfelt appreciation and reaffirm our surrender and dedication to you, which is considered the highest form of worship.\n\nHaribol\nYour humble and insignificant servants\nUjjwala radhika devi dasi\nMurali Govind dasa."

As I sit to write this offering, I realize how small my words are compared to the depth of what I feel. Still, I pray that whatever I write may carry even a drop of sincerity, because that is all I have to offer.\n\nMaharaj, your appearance in this world is not an ordinary event; it is a divine intervention.

Your struggles, your austerities, your search for truth, your tears, your prayers�they are not just stories.

A thought came, \"What will happen if it rains during the yatra Everything will collapse, and there will be lots of difficulty managing such a huge event.\" It appeared very difficult and impossible. But the Vrajwasi said, \"Depend on Krsna. The Lord will protect the yatra against rains as He protected the Vrajwasis 5,000 years ago.\" Wow, truly the Lord protected the yatra, and immediately after the yatra, the rain showered. This is the power of a pure devotee. Maharaj, your lectures during the yatra took us to the pastimes of the Lord live, and the kirtans were amazing. We all have witnessed your deep absorption both in katha and kirtan. Personally, I felt your personal association was available to all your disciples, just like all the Vrajwasis were having personal association with the Lord during the Govardhan Lila. I offer my deepest gratitude to all the devotees who were working day and night for months to organize this yatra. The management was absolute because it is not humanly possible to meet the needs of all individual devotees so precisely.\n\nMaharaj, your Krsna katha during the yatra was not only narrating the pastimes of the Lord but revealing subtle instructions. In all your lectures, while narrating the sweet pastimes of the Lord, you give instructions. On this occasion, I would like to cite a few lectures of yours for the pleasure of all Vaishnavas and to ponder over the subtle instructions given by you for all of us to follow carefully.\n\n1.  Amanina mana dena � We give all respect to others and expect none in return, that we do our service not for recognition but for the purification of our heart.\n2.  Ahankar: Ahankar is removed by the mercy of the Lord and not by our efforts. It may take time, but not much time considering millions and millions of births we have been working on it and chanting its glories. We have created a monster, but Krsna can kill that demon, and He will through His holy names, through the blessings of Guru, through seva. If we have sincerity, gradually it will happen. It may take your whole life, but that�s not too much time considering you have been building it, nourishing it for many lifetimes. But in the process, you have to be willing to fight the lower tendencies. First thing, do not find faults in others. Krsna curbed the false pride of Kaliya. Krsna curbed the ego of Indra. First, He cleansed the ego of a great demon, and now He is about to cleanse the ego of a great demigod. Indra is actually a devotee; we should never insult Indra because he is a great devotee, but somehow He uses this particular devotee to show by example how careful we should be.\n\n3.  Enthusiasm and patience = True surrender: We have to be patient, but at the same time, we have to work very hard with great enthusiasm. And if we are enthusiastic and patient, which is based on faith in the words of God, with the mercy of God, then with the combination of two is surrender.\n\nMaharaj, on this auspicious day, we all seek blessings from you for full protection, as we are all like crying babies, very close to Maya, and bound to do nonsense. We request you to forgive us and continue to shower your causeless mercy, and we all will try our best to serve you and Srila Prabhupada.\nPraying to all Vaishnavas to bless, so that I shed down my enjoying spirit and develop the service attitude in the mood of a servant of servants.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nPremkirtan das\nHyderabad."

    "country": "(India)",
    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna,\n\nMy most Revered Srila Guru Dev, please accept my prostrated humble obeisances at your merciful lotus-like feet.\n\nGuru Dev, for the last one year, our community (of god brothers and god sisters) residing here in Sri Vrindavan Dham, have been coming together every fortnight to relish �JOURNEY HOME� through your recorded recitation � a precious gift of yours to all of us. In these meetings, we try to hear one or two chapters and then, based on that, we share our reflections.\n\nI can confidently admit that it has been extremely nourishing association for each one of us. Hearing your inner thoughts in your own voice, with deep emotions from your heart, has gifted us your cherished divine Sanga and such connectivity that cannot be expressed in words.\n\nThis has not only helped us to unite as a god family, but has also helped us to grow together in our understanding through your struggles, what it means to be a sincere, devoted, and surrendered disciple. Sure enough, I am far from being such a follower, but yes, Guru Maharaj, I am gradually realizing the significance of carrying the responsibility of being faithful to our Guru and to the entire parampara.\n\nBy Sri Sri Gaur Nitai, Sri Sri Krishna Balaram, and Sri Sri Radha Shyamsundar�s blessings, I feel so fortunate to be amongst our Sanga group (all your wonderful children) in Sri Vrindavan Dham to celebrate your 75th divine appearance day.\n\nGuru Dev, your godly qualities are innumerable, and to choose and glorify any one is beyond my capacity. However, by regularly hearing from you, your amazing experiences about your inner journey has highlighted for me one specific trait of your divine personality.\n\nIn your search for God, you met with many people with different behaviors and spiritual practices, from an ordinary person to highly elevated souls. And from every interaction, you tried to take only that which could help you in your longing to know God and love Him. Impressed by the purity of your desire, you attracted everyone�s heart, and you made many friends during your travels. So much so that even after accepting Srila Prabhupada (your most beloved Guru Maharaj�s) shelter, those acquaintances, from whom many had become your lifelong friends, they fondly look forward to being with you.\n\n�The deepest *vapu* is actually when we surrender to the *vani*. We can truly experience the presence of our beloved Gurus according to our willingness to surrender with love to please them.� These profound words from your opening lecture during the Govardhan Yatra this time say it all.\n\nWhile describing the episode about Vajranabha, the great grandson of Krishna trying to excavate Vrindavan�s lost holy places, you said, �Actually, when I read this story in *Gopal Champu*, I was remembering when Srila Prabhupada came to Butler, Pennsylvania, in New York City, and he was trying so hard to do the mission of his Guru Maharaj, but everything seemed to be failing, and it seemed to be hopeless, and it seemed so helpless.� I was wondering� such absorption where Guru and Krishna become inseparable.\n\nThis amazing quality of yours has made me realize that the deeper we connect with God through our Guru�s *vani*, more and more we are freed from the externals and dualities of this world, and we are able to appreciate the essence in all without being entangled by the superficialities of the material world. With that maturity of fine balance, we can be of different sects, following a specific *sampradaya*, still, we can be welcoming and be sensitive towards other beliefs, and without being disloyal to our own Guru and Acharyas, we can offer our heartfelt respects to others.\n\nGuru Dev, I gain a lot of strength in my own spiritual practice from observing how you are always in the company of Srila Prabhupada�s *vani* � his every word, impressions, desires are your life and soul, what to speak of his instructions. The depth of your knowledge of his books is so thorough; you ponder on every word and scrutinizingly study each line, and very carefully, you take pains to train us in the same way.\n\nSrila Guru Dev, I humbly pray that instead of trying to imitate you and endanger my spiritual life, let me honestly follow in your footsteps, adhering to the teachings of our parampara, and become fixed up in the *siddhanta* of our philosophy, and not get carried away by the flowery words of the shallow world. And hopefully, one day I may also develop this maturity of seeing everything and everyone in connection with you and Krishna.\n\nOn this most auspicious birthday day of yours, I humbly beg for your compassionate blessings upon myself and all of us as followers of Srila Prabhupada, that we remain fully loyal to him and to our parampara, and at the same time, do not judge or criticize others or even look down upon others, bringing pain to Srila Prabhupada and Krishna.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nChandrika Radha Devi dasi"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances unto your lotus feet!\n\nMaharaj, as time is passing in KC, I am gradually coming to understand and realize your role and contribution as the most rare and valuable fortune I could ever receive. Although physically distant, I feel your deep concern and love for me through your words, devotees, and your example.\n\nMaharaj, the most beautiful aspect is your love for Srila Prabhupada. I am amazed that every action of yours is in complete absorption of Srila Prabhupada's pleasure. Every seva initiated and manifested by you, be it Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Govardhan Ecovillage, yatras, or Western preaching, is with the deep desire to love and please Prabhupada. Maharaj, your love for Prabhupada manifests as your deep respect, appreciation, and gratitude for other Prabhupada disciples. Years back, on Prabhupada's disappearance day, when your Godsister was giving her offering for Prabhupada and time went beyond 7:20 pm, you considered allowing her to continue glorifying Prabhupada as greater seva than singing *Je anilo* at 7:20 pm! Your offering of gratitude to Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj through book distribution, keeping your head at the lotus feet of your Godbrothers, keeping their instructions as the topmost priority, and always emphasizing cooperation shows how deeply you love Srila Prabhupada. You are the best gift of Srila Prabhupada in my life. Please bless me with genuine appreciation and love for Srila Prabhupada, for you, Prabhupada's disciples, and for devotees all around me. In one lecture, you answered that for us, along with appreciation for Prabhupada's disciples, it is so important to increase our appreciation for the love and service offered by each devotee around us.\n\nYour emphasis on devotee care is so deeply evident in yatra, projects, and devotees taking your instructions to their hearts. \"Part of devotee care is to allow devotees whom you care for to serve you\" is so deep and profound, Maharaj. Mukhwas seva in yatra, encouraging matajis to cook chapattis, and appreciating devotees cooking on chulhas for Govardhan brings out that what you truly appreciate and value are devotees and their coming closer to Krishna. Maharaj, one statement by you hit me so hard: when our legs were jammed, sitting in one position from Mangala arati till class, the first statement you said was, \"The association where devotees are coming together to call out to and hear about Krishna is the rarest! What you are getting now, please understand, is the rarest thing even demigods are desiring for!\" Maharaj, please bless this wretched soul with the understanding and appreciation of devotees in my life. Please bless me with the intelligence to be able to respect everyone properly and serve accordingly.\n\nMaharaj, the most beautiful and rarest thing you are offering us is your absorption in Krishna. By your mercy, this was my first yatra, and we all could feel your deep, ecstatic love for Krishna in your kirtans and kathas. Time really became conspicuous by its absence as you went on glorifying Govardhan. In your calling out to Krishna, you gave us an indescribable experience of Krishna and the spiritual world, Guru Maharaj. When you mentioned chanting as if this is your last moment on your deathbed, between you and Krishna, in the association of devotees, for those few moments, a conditioned soul like me could call out to Krishna with deep emotion and intention. Maharaj, please bless me with the understanding that what you are offering us in the form of love for Krishna is the rarest, and let me never leave this for the petty allurements of maya. Please give me strength to choose Krishna, and if I shake, please hold me, Guru Maharaj. I am very weak and helplessly being dragged by maya again and again.\n\nMaharaj, you are most accessible in my life through your lectures and devotees. Your lectures are deeply personal; I feel your genuine love and deep concern for me in your lectures. The best part is when, through your lectures, you make us realize and feel the situation of the characters, be it Prahlada, mother Kunti, Vrtrasura, or Gajendra. Hearing from you, I am able to increase my appreciation for the surrender of various characters in their circumstances. Maharaj, your lectures are my lifeline. Please help me realize and understand that your lectures are your personal association for me, and the more I imbibe and follow your vani in my life, the more intimate connection I can develop with you and please you. Maharaj, you are offering your love in the form of beautiful devotees in my life: mature seniors, intimate friends, enthusiastic juniors, and loving parents. Please bless me with obedience to seniors, intimacy and non-envy among friends, and genuine selflessness and compassion for juniors.\n\nMaharaj, I feel deeply amazed by your appreciation and gratitude for every person who is even slightly willing to appreciate and accept the gift of bhakti in their lives. You are a touchstone; everyone you come in contact with is touched with Krishna's love. Through your small gestures and dealings, you are offering us access to Krishna. Please bless me, Guru Maharaj, to become a transparent via medium of the mercy of Guru parampara and share this rarest gift of bhakti with each and every person I come in contact with.\n\nGuru Maharaj, as time is passing and the defensive nature of my false ego, envy, jnani, and yogic contaminations�anarthas�are getting revealed, I feel helplessly dragged by them. I lack words to express gratitude to you for offering me the best gift. Please help me realize its value and strive to maintain and preserve this. Please use me as your instrument in whatever way pleases you in service to Srila Prabhupada and his mission. I feel so protected in your merciful shelter, Guru Maharaj. If it pleases you, please accept me as a servant of your servants in your seva.\n\nThank you so much, Guru Maharaj,\nAspiring to be a servant of your servants,\nKhushi"

He was giving the example of Tulsi Maharani, how in the form of a plant she has expanded herself in a way that so many people can offer worship to her and receive devotional service.\n\nI was thinking in that way how you have expanded yourself in so many ways and have showered the mercy of Krishna and Guru Parampara in a way that I feel I have a path to follow where every step brings that joy and satisfaction which is ever increasing.

Your classes are very potent with realizations, compassion for us, and love for Krishna. You always teach us through your classes and personal example the life of an ideal devotee.\n\n1.  **Gratitude**: You always put a lot of emphasis on gratitude. I remember in most of your classes, you say, \"Gratitude is the womb of all qualities; without gratitude, we are dead.\" You have so much love for your spiritual master, so much so that you are ready to sacrifice your life. During the days of New Vrindavan, you suffered a lot through the pains and freezing cold. This shows your complete surrender and dedication to your spiritual master's instructions. Many times, I often take gratitude on a theoretical level, but in one class, which was my first offline class in Chowpatty from you, you were mentioning that gratitude doesn't just mean saying \"thank you\"; it means acting on it in reciprocation with whatever is done for us. You gave an example of HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj, how he sacrificed for SP.\n\n2.  **Enthusiasm**: You put a lot of focus on enthusiasm being a very special quality in devotional service. Enthusiasm with patience is a very good combination for Bhakti for the development of faith in one's KC.\n\n3.  **Humility**: In every lecture of yours, you give a lot of importance to humility because it's the quality which attracts the heart of Krishna and Vaishnavas. If we are humble, then progress is very fast, as there will not be any offenses.\n\nYour dealings with your godbrothers attract others' hearts and teach us lessons which are beyond any sadhana and hearing. Your affectionate nature and concern for each and every devotee are exemplary.\nI am just an insignificant servant, trying, failing, trying again and again to somehow or other serve in my small capacity. But if you desire and are pleased by my little endeavor, then it is success. Your pleasure means my superiors should be pleased with me. I will try to follow their footsteps in any circumstances, as they represent you and your instructions.\nPlease bestow your causeless mercy upon me.

I was really inspired to read that although you were born in America, your behavior and the lifestyle you preferred were totally different from the American way of living.

As you quite often recollect and quote various special incidents in relation to Srila Prabhupada. This year is very special for me as it has been 10 years since I first got in touch with you.

To be a disciple doesn't only mean to have some special interactions with one's Guru but most importantly to actually take his instructions very seriously (to the core of one's heart: as Srila Narottam Das Thakur says, \"guru mukha padma vakya cittete koriya aikya ara na kariho mane asa�\"). Even Srila Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur says that \"yasya prasadad bhagavad prasado�\" only by pleasing the spiritual master can one please Krishna. When the spiritual master is displeased, there is only havoc in the life of a disciple. One may externally do a lot of things; however, if those acts displease you, then what's the use As unqualified as I am, I seek your blessings so that I can truly follow the instructions you have given us throughout my life. As days are passing and seeing the strong influence of Kaliyuga, it's truly very, very challenging and almost impossible to keep up to one's sacred vows unless one is regularly associating with serious devotees and performing strict sadhana. I intensely pray that I could truly please you by keeping up with my vows and strive to share this message with others.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, the recent Kartik Yatra at Sri Govardhan Dham was such a great memory and experience which has etched within my mind. As you mentioned to us in your classes, I do wish that this memory be carried throughout this life and across all the lives I may remain within this material world. Let me always remain your humble servant engaged in your service life after life.\n\nYour servant,\nSukumara Gauranga Das"

Though we're not at all qualified, by your causeless mercy, we are getting strength to practice devotional service. After completing the 2024 Kartik Yatra, we were wondering where the 2025 Kartik Yatra would happen. Generally, it would be Vrindavan Dham. Internally, I had a feeling that due to traffic restrictions, it would be very difficult to accommodate all the devotees in Vrindavan. I was thinking this year the yatra might happen in Govardhan. It had been a long time since we stayed in Govardhan during Kartik. We too had a desire to hear your pravachan and get your association at Govardhan. Somehow, on Goura Purnima day, it was announced that this year the yatra is in Govardhan. Our dream became true by your causeless mercy. Our children Jamuna, Toshan, and Keshav were very enthusiastic to attend the yatra. The children really enjoyed the Kids Zone. It is a great experience to associate with devotees in the holy dham and do Govardhan parikrama. Due to the responsibility to take care of the children, I could not sit near your vyasasan and hear the class. Now I am trying to hear those lectures daily. Dear Gurudev, we have so many anarthas in our hearts. It's very difficult to overcome the temptations of maya, Maharaj. On this Vyasa Puja, we pray at your Lotus feet that we may always remain in association with sincere devotees who are rendering transcendental loving devotional service.

I realized that we can never fully repay the love of the devotees who, following your guidance, poured their hearts into making this yatra a grand success.\n\nI beg forgiveness for my shortcomings and past mistakes.

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada!!\n\nThis time I got an opportunity to write this offering from the most auspicious place of Ter Kadamba in Vrindavan. I was simply meditating how surreal it is to be a part of such a glorious parampara. Without your mercy, I never would have ever taken to Bhakti. Thank you so much, Maharaj.\n\nWords are not sufficient to really describe the mercy we receive from you, Maharaj. Every passing day I understand how much you have done for us and sacrificed for us. The first time I read *Journey Home*, it was kind of mystical and inspiring, but when I keep on hearing and reading, I understand the depths of your realizations and the sacredness of your life and nature. Thank you for mercifully coming to this world and giving hope to fallen fools like me.\n\nLast year was very special for me as we got initiated by you. In my life, not many times have I felt the sensation of divineness surrounding me, and certainly, nothing was more than the moment we came before you during initiation. The few moments you saw into my eyes felt like an eternity. I am most grateful to you because, in spite of seeing all the dirt in my heart and how sinful I am, you still agreed to give shelter to me at your lotus feet.\n\nWhen we were in GEV, we got an opportunity to interact with the devotees there. Hearing them, we could understand your heart. Vrindavan is always manifested in your heart. Like it�s mentioned in the bhajan, \"Tomara hrdaye sada Govinda Vishram�\", the pastimes of Lord are always manifested in your heart, and GEV is just a peek into your divine heart and your oceanic love for The Lordships.\n\nIn the recent Kartik yatra, we were showered with nectarean pastimes of The Lordships. But I was so much touched by the kirtans. One thing I understood when you asked us to raise our hands and chant out loud from the heart is that you give us a chance to chant the pure holy names. It reminds me of the pastime where SP said that because this devotee once purely chanted the holy name in Vrindavan, he was taken by the Lord. Every action of yours has a deep meaning attached to it. When will the day come where I can understand your heart filled with compassion This material world has nothing tangible to offer, but the fool that I am, I still have attraction to it. When will the day come where I will be drowning, tasting the nectar of love from your compassionate heart I cry and cry and weep thinking of how big a fool I am to not take seriously your instructions. I feel a lot of separation from you, and there is nothing but prayers I can offer to the Lord to get your association.\n\nI know that I cannot approach you with my currently diseased state, but I promise you, Maharaj, that I will give the last of my breath in serving this mission of Srila Prabhupada. I am constantly praying that someday I will be empowered to do something which will please you. I sincerely pray to you that whatever service comes, I neither do it for my own personal aggrandizement nor for any fame, post, or prestige.\n\nThe ashram life, as I understand it, is like *Ksurasya dhara sucira sramasya�* there is a thin line saying where there is a limit. I hope and pray that I never cross that and trap myself again in the web of material life.\n\nI beg and pray to The Lordships that lifetime after lifetime I get an opportunity to serve at your lotus feet. I have no personal aspirations, but there is a burning desire to serve you and Vaishnavas. Please use me as an instrument in your hand and make me move as you like.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nPrayojana crya das"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances, Guru Maharaj. I wish you a very happy 75th appearance day, Guru Maharaj. Please accept the following humble offerings unto your lotus feet by your insignificant servant.\n\nFirstly, like father, like son.\nHis Holiness Bhakti Rasamrit Swami Maharaj gave a lecture on Srimad-Bhagavatam 2.10.29 at Chowpatty, and I was attending the lecture online. During the class, as the camera zoomed out, what I saw was truly inspiring. I saw you sitting near the door of the altar, listening to the entire session of Maharaj. This incident reminds me of your Guru Maharaj, Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who also used to sit and listen to lectures from his disciples. It gave me a feeling of 'like father, like son'. You sat through the lecture till the end. I pray to the Lord to grant me a drop of this quality of hearing patiently. Also, in many of your lectures, you mention the speaker's name and what they have said in their lecture, showing how much you love to hear about Krishna Katha.\n\nSecondly, Guru Maharaj, you make your lectures more realistic by incorporating sound effects, such as the breaking down of trees and various animal sounds. This enhances the Hari Katha, making it sweeter, and your sense of humor adds to the nectar. Thank you for providing such enriching lectures that bring us closer to Krishna.\n\nThirdly, the mood of prayers.\nWhile reading \"The Journey Home\", many times I came across incidents that showcased your intense prayer mode to the Lord. Your prayers at Kashi Vishwanath... \"My Lord, I long to know You and to love You. Please show me the path I must follow.\" You didn't know it was Mathura and Janmashtami, but you reached there with your friend Gary. I can't even imagine or feel the intensity of your prayers. But those words of prayer make me numb. Whenever I read the book and come across such prayers, I wish I could have even a bit of that mood.\n\nFourthly, sacrifice and Maa Ganga's reciprocation. Last but not the least, from \"The Journey Home\", I came to know how much you loved your dearest companion, Harmonica, and how you dipped it into the Ganga just because it was demanding your full attention. And to move ahead in your spiritual path, you sacrificed it. And after that, Maa Ganga revealed to you the highest thing - Hare Krishna Mahamantra. This incident touched me a lot. As your Harmonica was your only companion from the beginning, but you left it for a higher purpose in your life. I learned how important it is to be detached from one's dearest things to move ahead in spiritual life.\n\nThere is much more to glorify the qualities about you, but due to my shortcomings and limitations, I could put forward this much as an offering to you on this most auspicious occasion of Vyas Pooja. I pray unto your lotus feet that may I even get a drop of such great qualities in my life. I pray to Sri Sri Radha Govind Dev Ji for your good health because we need you, Guru Maharaj. The conditioned souls like me need you \n\nYour Servant \nAkshita"

They are just like desire trees who can fulfill the desires of everyone, and they are full of compassion for the fallen conditioned souls.\n\nI don't know where I should start from, because I am so in debt to Srila Radhanath Swami Maharaj. Maharaj is an individual who has changed the way I look at this material creation. I used to think that all the jivas other than devotees are nonsense. I had no compassion for people in general, but as I started to hear Maharaji's lectures, I realized that there is a great sense of gratitude Maharaji holds for everything, and at the same time he is compassionate, merciful, selfless, etc., towards every single living entity. What to talk about non-devotees, he is even very compassionate to each and every being, whether in the body of an animal or anything else.\n\nMaharaj is an ocean of mercy; he is filled with Love of Godhead.\nWhen I started reading THE JOURNEY HOME, it was a humbling experience, and knowing that Maharaj has gone through so much is soul-enlightening. The book \"Journey Home\" extremely decreased my critical nature towards the world.\nThe way you deal with your disciples sometimes is like you are cutting their false ego.\nYour lectures have made me a bit humble and increased my service attitude.\n\nMaharaj, I pray to you and beg at your lotus feet to please bless me so that I cooperate with devotees and serve SRILA PRABHUPADA.

Since early days, I have repeatedly heard you emphasizing the qualities of *tranadapi sunicena*, the quality of being a servant of servants, the quality of being grateful.\nThis year, one devotee was offering glorification to Srila Prabhupada, and at that time, he quoted you once said, \"Gratitude is Bhakti.\" You begin all your talks by expressing gratitude to devotees. Even during your journey home � travel to India � you came across so many spiritual masters of different traditions; you always learned something good from them, being grateful to them.\nMay I imbibe this quality of gratitude which you have been repeatedly emphasizing.\nI was hearing one of your classes on Selfless Attitude where you were reading from *SB* 10th Canto, and Parikshit Maharaj is asking there, \"Why does Krishna perform immoral tasks, dancing with the wives of others\" There the section comes that Parikshit Maharaj, although now only one more day to leave, is asking questions not for his own sake but for the benefit of others � who may have such doubts, being *karmis*, *jnanis*... In this class, you emphasized the importance of how we should be living our lives for the welfare of others, rather than being self-occupied.\n\nEvery word you speak is full of so much conviction, and you mean it, really.\nRecently, my most fond experience in this Kartik Yatra is getting the opportunity to see you chanting during the morning program in the Pandal. I have observed how you are so intense in everything, with a very prayerful attitude. For several minutes, I observed you offering prayers to Tulsi Maharani. This scene is imprinted in my mind. Same way, during the night dancing kirtan, you urged us to call out the holy name very seriously, with feeling. I see this feeling is something missing in my practice of Krishna Consciousness.\n\nYou always appreciate your God brothers wholeheartedly, with great delight. And you expect all your disciples to treat/serve your godbrothers with great respect and love.\n\nIt is my great fortune that I have the association of your beloved disciples. By seeing their dedication, service, and commitment, I get some glimpse of how glorious a master I have. I am grateful to you, Maharaj, for all the wonderful gifts in Krishna consciousness you have bestowed upon me: association of HG Radheshyam Prabhuji, vibrant Sanga at ISKCON NVCC, so many loving friends, resources, money, and all facilities to preach.\nDespite all this, I regret that I am not able to take full benefit of these great gifts. I am still struggling with my lower nature of passion and ignorance. This year, although you mercifully were awarding the sacred second initiation, as per the guidance and advice of HG Radheshyam Prabhu, I thought to wait and not take this step unless I overcome my lower natures. However, seeing my situation, I feel hopeless, Gurudev, that on my own strength, I will be able to overcome my weakness. I need your causeless mercy. I am too much affected by the bodily conception of life, and I take this body too seriously. I seek your blessings that may I be able to serve as per your expectations.\n\nI have so many material desires still lurking in my heart. I know if I take shelter of your lotus feet, I will surely be successful in becoming a pure devotee one day.\n\nKindly forgive my offenses, as I have neglected, disregarded so many good instructions you have imparted for my welfare. I am knowingly eating poison by not paying heed to this.\n\nThank you for everything. My prayers to Sri Sri Radhaa Vrindavanchandra, Sri Sri Gaur Nitai, Srila Prabhupada that may they give you good health and long life, so that many of us who are dependent on you continue to get your divine Sanga.\n\nYour Servant,\nKadamb Kanan Das\nISKCON NVCC Pune Ashram."

I know this day must be the greatest austerity for you, yet out of your endless compassion�simply to see us happy�you tolerate everything with such grace.\n\nThere is so much I wish to say, but I will share only a few things from my heart. My greatest inspiration, Prabhupda�s disciple HG Yamun Dev Ds Mataji, wrote in her biography how lovingly you cared for your godsisters, especially Yamun Mataji, during her times of need. She also shared how you supported Jahnavi Mataji (Yamun Mataji�s younger sister) in her devotional journey.\n\nI have also heard from senior Vaiavas in many lectures that you are a person who does not seek attention, yet purely to serve rla Prabhupda you accepted the immense responsibility of the Bombay temple. I remember hearing how you promised the Punjabi officer who allowed you to enter Bhrat-bhmi that one day you would do something good for the people of this country�and you fulfilled that promise by starting so many projects that help people embrace Krishna consciousness.\n\nI first heard you speak when you were glorifying Sindhutai, and I felt your compassion had no limits. In 2023, I had the fortune of having your darshan in Kolkata. On the first day, when you visited the Newtown temple, I was overjoyed, but somehow not fully satisfied because I only caught a glimpse of you.\n\nBut the very next day, by the mercy of Niti-Gaurga, I again received your darshan at Gt Bhavan, BRC. And while you were leaving, you waved at me. I was so happy that I told the story to everyone like an excited little child.\n\nI think my words are becoming long now, Maharaj, so I will simply say: Happy, happy birthday. I am nobody, but I like to believe that Niti-Gaurga loves me, and therefore I have received so much mercy through you. I pray for your good health so that you may see the Abhay Tirtha Project manifest as soon as possible.\n\nI love you, Maharaj.\nHare Krishna. rla Prabhupda ki jai."

But still, I take this wonderful opportunity to offer a drop from the ocean of your wonderful qualities.\n\nGurudeva, as from last year it was a very wonderful experience as I have got your personal association when you had been to Kolkata. The moment when we met you, and as we gave our introduction and spoke about Jamshedpur and the program which was scheduled for you to visit there in the coming days, you immediately asked us whether we were going to be there when you were visiting. I felt so sheltered that you did not ignore us, although it was just a small piece of information. Thank you, Gurudeva, for your kindness and mercy on fallen souls like me. When you had actually visited Jamshedpur, it was like a dream coming true that just before that, some months prior, I had just been thinking in my mind whether it would come true that in the seva sthali which I had been given, I would get to see my Guru Maharaj. Then, just a few months after that, it was like Lord Krishna personally reciprocated on this poor soul's desire, and that came true. I actually had no bounds to my happiness to see you, Gurudeva, in the same place where I was going for preaching for a decade. During your visit also, we arranged a college professors' program by HG Gauranga Prabhu, and it was successful with almost 100 people attending and taking prasadam. After that, HG Gauranga Prabhu visited the voice and blessed all devotees and encouraged us for more youth preaching. In the evening, we went for the actual program and got to receive your divine association and the mercy of your glance as well. This all was an extra mercy and boost in our preaching, making us understand that Lord Krishna, Srila Prabhupada, and your Holiness all have showered immense mercy, and I came to one understanding: how I shouldn�t take any of my services lightly, because the spiritual master can at any moment turn towards that, and then I could have become humiliated. But Gurudeva, in recent years, the preaching in Jamshedpur is picking up by your divine blessings and mercy, although there are some hard struggles going on. This year also, we started preaching, and it is picking up, but we have problems from time to time.\n\nGurudeva, last year in book distribution, we distributed around 3200 books, but of course, I didn�t do much. It was the constant efforts of HG Raj Gopinath Prabhu and all devotees connected to NIT Jamshedpur, who collected funds, distributed books hand to hand, person to person. They worked hard to fulfill the desire of Srila Prabhupada of pushing the books, for if one reads a sentence or a word, his life is successful.\n\nGurudeva, we are also trying to connect the parents of students connected to NIT through regular classes, yatras, and sometimes personal visits. Some of them are also picking up very seriously to chanting holy names and following the four regulative principles and reading Srila Prabhupada�s books, and also engaging in some services. We have professor preaching also going on, and regularly they attend classes, and some of them are chanting 1-2 rounds regularly, and some of them in recent marathons took Srila Prabhupada's SB and BG.\n\nGurudeva, in recent months, we have started college preaching in Kolkata, and we have got a place as of now. Students are trying hard to connect to youths in local colleges, and this process is going on, and we need your blessings to continue ahead and inspire many souls to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada in His birthplace.\n\nGurudeva, as I informed about the other services I received in Newtown, Kolkata, i.e., deity services and some cultivation of well-wishers. Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga are very merciful here, and they are giving me so much opportunity to serve them in the form of their divine services. I am also trying to serve them to whatever extent possible, but because of my laziness, argumentative mentality, and finding faults, I am increasing their anxiety. Gurudeva, kindly bless that you have given me divine association and wonderful opportunity of chanting holy names and devotee association, but still, at times, I am not taking them seriously, rather I am misusing these opportunities. Gurudeva, in recent past years, we have tried to maintain the standards which we were taught from earlier times. Festivals have been improved by the endeavors of HG Vrindavan Chari Prabhu, from Janmashtami to Kartik month, to Gaur Purnima, to Rama Navami, to Brahmotsava, and every festival, thousands of visitors practically and everyone is in bliss to take darshan of Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga and Srila Prabhupada.\n\nGurudeva, in recent past months, we are trying to connect all people who were serving deities by giving some financial help and some sort of Bhakti cultivation through programs in their homes and yatras. These are also going well, and they are voluntarily taking up services.\n\nGurudeva, as per your desire, we need to erect a beautiful temple for the pleasure of Srila Prabhupada. We are also trying to march in that direction to please you and all other Srila Prabhupada disciples. Kindly shower your merciful glances and blessings that we can do something in this direction.\n\nGurudeva, as my personal sadhana, I try to regularly hear your lectures and HDG A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada�s lectures and get a glimpse of divine association. Your lectures are a great source of my inspiration, and I take so much pleasure and nourishment in hearing them. When Gurudeva, I hear the lectures, I get my radar positioned on track for pure devotional service to Their Lordships and give away all traces of false attachments and distractions. The recent yatra to Govardhan with you was very inspirational. I got back on track my life of pure devotional service, otherwise Gurudeva, as I get along with services and because of attachments which I am maintaining, I make my d.s. a tool for increasing my false ego. But as I attended this yatra, I got back again to the roots of pure devotional service which you always stress, and as I hear from you in personal association, it leaves a deep impression of your purity in sticking to principles, not getting distracted, and emphasis on devotional services, and your wonderful service attitude, and how you are inspiring so many devotees all around the globe, and everyone seeking your association and getting happy and contributing so wonderfully to the mission of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nGurudeva, I got to see this time your attachment to Srila Prabhupada and the deep separation you are undergoing from Srila Prabhupada. Thank you, Gurudeva, for showing us through your example how we should cultivate this mood of separation from the spiritual master and how we have to serve the spiritual master in separation without getting distracted from his teachings.\n\nThank you once again, Gurudeva, for all that you have given me. And it is said that we cannot repay what the Spiritual Master has given to us. So, I remain an eternal debtor in this case, but I try to follow the instructions which you have given me through the lectures and try to honestly live by those principles and try my best to never let you down.\n\nGurudeva, kindly forgive me for offenses and mistakes I commit towards you because of my ignorance and arrogance.\n\nYours aspiring servant of a servant,\nSri Ram Raghav Das\nIskcon Newtown, Kolkata"

By your grace, you sent your representatives, HG Radheshyam Prabhuji and HG Tamal Govind Prabhuji, to pick me up from the ocean of nescience and place me at the care of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath and Sri Sri Nimai Nitai.\nI am also really grateful for allowing me to come to this year�s Kartik Yatra at Giriraj Govardhan Dham. Although I expressed no significant desire to receive your association, you were so kind as to send devotees who made me develop a strong desire to come for the yatra, take me to GEV and make me pray to Govardhan there, and also arrange a substitution for me. This year was my first Kartik Yatra, and it was a truly memorable one and the best part of the yatra for getting absorbed in your sweet and ecstatic kirtans!\n\nI was introduced to Krishna Consciousness not more than a couple of years ago, and you have showered such great fortune on me that I got so many wonderful opportunities to serve you and the mission of rila Prabhupda. Last summer, I got the chance to render some intense services in our SPW PDW 2025 camp for this year�s Nakuls, and that experience was mind-blowing. Over the span of two months there, I got to learn so many things and to also assist in the preaching of IIT Bombay, one of your cherished colleges for preaching. Even this year, devotees have kindly engaged me in whatever little service possible, and I am truly indebted to you for that.\n\nOne thing that I am really blessed to have is the vast ocean of your lectures. HG Tamal Govind Prabhuji mentioned many times that whatever problem we are facing, you have given at least a few lectures on every topic. So we just have to type our anarthas, and we get the direct association of your divine v, instantaneously! But it is my misfortune and laziness that I have not been able to properly cultivate hearing from you, and I beg you to please give me the desire to regularly hear your v and overcome my anarthas. Lately, I have been struggling with lust, because of which my focus on Krishna Consciousness has reduced. And due to anarthas like envy, anger, and pride, my relationship with other Vaiavas has been spoiled.\n\nOn this auspicious day, I sincerely pray to you to give me the strength to overcome these anarthas and to be engaged eternally in the service of your lotus feet. Please bless me that I can become a humble servant of your servants in serving the mission of rila Prabhupda and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to spread the holy name of Krishna throughout the world.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nSujit"

On this auspicious occasion of your 75th VYASPUJA, we pray at the LOTUS FEET OF SRILA PRABHUPADA and SRI SRI RADHAGOPINATHJI to shower their choicest blessings upon you and bless you with good health and long life.\n\nGURUDEV, today when I go back in history of your \"Journey Home,\" I vividly remember the promise that you made to the Sardarji security personnel at the India-Pakistan border when you did not have any money to bribe the guards in your sincere and desperate attempt to come to India in search of GOD. Not only we, your disciples or aspiring disciples, but the whole world are and will be eternally indebted to the elderly Sardarji for his compassion and kindness in allowing you to enter India. Had he not shown compassion to you at that time, maybe none of us, including me, would have been writing our VYASPUJA offerings to you today.\n\nIn one of your lectures, you mentioned that small things make a big difference. This act of the elderly Sardarji exemplifies the above statement. Had he not shown compassion, there would not have been a flourishing and vibrant RADHAGOPINATH devotee community, Bhaktivedanta Hospital, Annamrita Foundation, GOVERDHAN Eco Village, and many, many more other centers and projects.\n\nGURUDEV, today with full and firm faith and conviction, we can say with a clear heart that in many, many ways, you have more than fulfilled your promise to the Sardarji that if he allowed you to enter India, YOU will do something great for this country.\n\nGURUDEV, you have always put the comfort and care of others over your own comfort and pleasures, which we have seen in multiple instances wherein, in spite of ill health, you would brave all odds to give class or meet devotees or important guests to whom you may have given time. One small such incident was narrated to me by HG MADHVANAND Prabhuji of BHAKTIVEDANTA Hospital a few years back when he came to our house at Nagpur. He said once you had gone to the hospital for some meeting, and later on, you were supposed to give an evening class at Mira Road Temple. He said during and after the meeting, you developed a very high fever and severe body pain, because of which you decided to take rest. All the senior disciples and doctors at BHAKTIVEDANTA Hospital advised you against giving class in the evening, and they all were pretty sure that you would not be in a position to give class because of ill health. As planned, they all went to Mira Road Temple in the evening, expecting someone else to be the speaker. All were pleasantly SHOCKED and surprised to see you come on stage as if nothing happened and give a wonderful class. Prabhuji told me that according to the condition in which he saw you on the afternoon, it was IMPOSSIBLE for any normal human being to get up and give class in a matter of a few hours. This determination of yours shows your exemplary quality of putting people first.\n\nGURUDEV, like waves in an ocean, your good qualities are infinite, but this worthless soul cannot remember or describe all of them. GURUDEV, I sincerely pray at YOUR LOTUS FEET to grant me a drop of your infinite mercy so that I am able to follow all your instructions, especially the 3rd verse of SHISHASHTAKAM, of trying to become more humble than a blade of grass, more tolerant than a tree, and to offer all respects to everyone and not expect any respect from anyone.\n\nPraying for your good health and expecting to get a drop of your unlimited mercy.\nYour insignificant, worthless servant of servants,\nRSABHA DEV das\nNagpur"

I am feeling very fortunate to express my gratitude and thanks on this auspicious occasion of your Vyaspuja today.\n\nIn the year 2017, I met ISKCON devotees and enrolled for spiritual sessions. When I was in my 2nd year of college, my seniors guided me to hear your lectures. Being very new, I had very meager knowledge about Krishna consciousness. I was able to understand Krishna conscious philosophy very easily just by hearing your lectures at that time. Your profound knowledge and realizations deeply touched my heart in the ongoing journey of my spiritual life. Although I haven�t received your direct association, but by devotees' mercy, I have been attending Kartik yatras. Due to that, at least once a year I am able to get your association. So many unheard pastimes of Krishna and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu you used to describe with full ecstasy and derive important lessons for us to follow. Your analogies, real-life examples, and realizations inspire me a lot.\n\nYou have explained your whole spiritual journey in the book �The Journey Home,� which is very much inspiring to read, and I am aspiring for such sincerity and dedication to practice Krishna consciousness as shown by you. Over the years, your dedication to the mission of Srila Prabhupada has been increasing more and more. I saw more than 12,000 devotees attending yatra and cooperating with each other, being satisfied with whatever services they get, facilities they get, selflessly serving in the mega kitchen all day and night. Being very grounded to earth, your humility and selflessness touch people�s hearts. Although suffering from so many anarthas, I find great relief by hearing your lectures. In the coming year, I am planning to take out important instructions from your recorded lectures and transcripts and will try to follow sincerely.\n\nPlease bless me, Gurudeva, to become a significant instrument in the hands of my authorities in the mission of Srila Prabhupada and practice Bhakti for the pleasure of Krishna without ulterior motive.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nShashank"

Dive deep into Chanting, Hearing, and Serving.\n2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Krishna.\n3. Strive to be united as a community.\n4. Practice enthusiasm in preaching Krishna Consciousness.\n5. Bhakti is not about quantity or numerals, it's about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n   Lastly, You shared with them that - \"Never compromise quality for quantity and infuse quality into all your quantity.\" These instructions are the sum and substance of the teachings of our glorious Guru Parampara.

All glories to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga\n\nMaharaj, for the last 75 years, many fallen souls like me in this world have immensely benefited by your divine presence on this earth, and we pray that we will continue to receive your mercy for eternity.\n\nOn this very glorious 75th year of your divine appearance, I wish to offer my humble thoughts on your divine and excellent qualities, which cherish and nourish all of us, and which I would like to imbibe in my life as a service to you.\n\nOne quality, gratitude, is outstanding and naturally built into your great personality. We have seen in your Journey Home that from beginning to end, and in all situations, even to the extent of near-death experiences, you expressed your gratitude to Krishna. In all your classes, you genuinely express your gratitude to the audience, from beginning to end. You express gratitude to everyone and anyone without discrimination, seeing them as instruments and parts and parcels of God. On many occasions, you have shown this quality of gratitude even to taximen and liftmen, what to speak of devotees and your Godbrothers, to Srila Prabhupada and to Sri Sri Radhagopinath. As the attitude of gratitude is the most positive quality, my sincere prayers to you for bestowing at least an iota of the quantity you possess naturally.\n\nThe second quality of your good self that naturally permeates to all of us is the ability to spontaneously appreciate others. This appreciation of others acts like such a tonic that everyone is favorably attracted to you. You always mention this quality of appreciating others in your classes and emphasize appreciating at the right time. Once Hg Radheshyam Prabhu shared that he was appreciating you with many mouths. After hearing him, you said, �I very much appreciate your appreciation.� That�s amazing and so witty. This quality of appreciation also creates a great positive environment and culture. I sincerely seek your blessings to imbibe it in my life and dealings with all.\n\nAnother quality in you that amazes me is your ability to extend yourself for higher causes and for devotees, your Godbrothers, despite your not-so-good health. This is due to your unconditional, genuine concern for others. I heard one devotee sharing that during one of the Jagannath Puri yatras, you were very sick and not even in a position to get up from bed. It was decided that HH Bhakti Rasamrita Swami Maharaj would give class in the evening in the pandal to 5000-7000 devotees. Maharaj had also prepared for the class. However, in the evening, you were seen in the Vyasasan singing Jay Radha Madhav. When asked by one of your Godbrothers, after the class, how you came to give the class despite your ill health, you mentioned that �So many devotees who came from so far places and are eagerly waiting to receive Krishna katha, how can I be on the bed.� That�s the real, genuine concern you have towards the spiritual lives of your disciples and devotees. Maharaj, as I am very, very poor in this aspect of extending myself, I am sincerely begging for your mercy so that I can be of some use to others.\n\nOverall, Maharaj, each of your words and acts are great learning lessons for all of us.\nToday, on this most auspicious day of your 75th year of appearance, I sincerely seek your blessings to develop an iota of your unlimited qualities and be an instrument of your greatest quality of mercy and compassion and serve your mission to please Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour eternal servant of servant of servant\n\nRemuna Das"

During my second yatra to Mayapur, I was blessed with Maharaj�s close darshan, and I felt immense joy.Now, during this yatra at Govardhan in Vrindavan, I truly received Maharaj�s mercy. I was fortunate to have Maharaj�s darshan from very close. Just two days before the yatra, I got the opportunity to join the Latur group of Matajis who were engaged in service. When we reached Govardhan, I got the chance to serve along with them. We did the service of cutting dry fruits together.I came to know that Maharaj was about to arrive there. Shortly after, Maharaj came. All of us Matajis went outside to welcome him. Maharaj stepped out of the car, folded his hands, and looked at everyone as he walked forward. At that moment, my daughter and I folded our hands and offered full obeisances. I felt as if Maharaj was showering his mercy upon me and my daughter through his glance. That moment was unforgettable for me.\n\nMaharaj�s quality of humility is truly extraordinary. During the seven-day yatra at Govardhan, I got the opportunity to hear Maharaj narrate the Govardhan pastimes. And Maharaj�s kirtans were even more wonderful! Every day the tune of the sankirtan was different, and I loved them all. When Maharaj would chant �Jaya Jaya Sri Radhe,� it felt as if we had truly reached the lotus feet of Srimati Radharani�as if Maharaj had taken us to Goloka Dham.\n\nFinally, I pray at the lotus feet of the Lord that Maharaj be blessed with strong health and that I may have the fortune of Maharaj�s association every year. I also pray at the lotus feet of Gurudev that I may progress in my spiritual service.\n\nHare Krishna, my humble obeisances."

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna\nDandavat Pranam\n\nI am new to Krishna consciousness and I am here solely because of the mercy and prayers of my dearest friend Deepali Kondvilkar (who is an aspiring disciple of Maharaj). She is the one who introduced me to this wonderful world of Krishna, Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam, yatras, devotees, and Maharaj.\n\nThis is my first ever offering, and I thought offerings were given only by disciples to their beloved Guru Maharaj, until HG Padma Kishori mataji told me it's about expressing gratitude, so I decided to offer too. I am very, very grateful to be a part of this world. My first ever darshan of Maharaj was on Radhashtami at Chowpatty. The thing that touched me the most about Maharaj was the way he looked at all the devotees present, like all of us, with so much gratitude and love. It made me feel so welcomed and part of a family, with just one glance. I hadn't experienced anything like this before. From then onwards, there was no turning back. I couldn't visit Mumbai without visiting Chowpatty.\n\nAnd of course GEV! I have lost my heart there. You can feel Maharaj's presence everywhere there, even when He is not present, in all the small and big things. Like stainless steel buckets, electric vehicles inside the campus, waste segregation, and so many things. So much care, so much mindfulness for every living being. The dogs there are not just fed but also taken care of when not well. I personally saw one dog who was isolated and treated for a medical condition. The same goes with cats, and what to say of all the beautiful cows and bulls!\nBy causeless mercy, I could also attend Kartik yatras for 3 consecutive years, and I'm still in awe!\n\nThere are so many things to express, but I am not able to find the correct words. I just wish to express my heartfelt gratitude!\n\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada!\nAll glories to Sri Guru and Gauranga!\nHare Krishna "

You asked for the same things that you have been speaking in your lectures for decades - going deeper into hearing and chanting, deeper into the mood of service, staying united, improving the quality of our services, sharing the message which Srila Prabhupada has given.\n\nMaharaj, thank you so much for your lectures. Your lectures have protected me from leaving the path of devotional service and also have sustained my spiritual life. Once, in your glorification session, HG Giriraj Prabhu said - 'It is the words of your spiritual master that will come to your help when you need them the most'. When you speak about reversals, setbacks, how we should take it in our life, it is so blissful. It brings great happiness even when we may be surrounded by misery. The way you speak on how the miseries we face may be the result of our own karma, or a tailor-made situation created by Krishna, so that we can become purified and can come closer to Him. And after speaking about principles and philosophy, you give such beautiful descriptions of great souls in our parampara or from scriptures. How Yudhishthira Maharaj, how Narottam das Thakur, Prahlad Maharaj, Ambarisha Maharaj, Dhruva Maharaj, and so many others, how they responded to situations which were apparently unjust towards them. But their response to such situations is so beautiful, and it inspires us so much.\n\nMaharaj, once again, thank you for your beautiful lectures. Recently, I came to know that before giving lectures, you prepare for hours together. I was amazed to hear this. You are taking this service so seriously! You may have given lectures on the same topic hundreds of times, but still, you prepare. I pray at the lotus feet of Krishna that He awards me the sincerity to hear and accept what you are so painstakingly trying to give us.\n\nMy prayers to Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji on this very blessed day that They award you a long and healthy life.\n\nYour servant,\nShubham Biyani"

    "Your Offering": "Dearest Gurudeva,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances. All glories to rla Prabhupda.\n\nTrying to write for you feels like trying to measure the sky with a ruler; whatever I attempt falls short, yet the attempt itself feels like a blessing. Still, with a hopeful heart, I place these words at your lotus feet.\n\nA quality of you, Maharaj, that continually touches my heart is the way gratitude flows so naturally from you. You thank everyone, you uplift everyone, you make every person feel seen. Watching you, I�ve slowly understood that gratitude is not decoration in spiritual life; it is the very essence that softens the heart and makes devotion possible. This single lesson has reshaped how I look at my own journey.\n\nYour instructions during this year�s Govardhan Dham Kartik Yatra made an especially deep impression on me. I could hear from you about your journey in �The Journey Home� where you traveled through so many traditions and philosophies. When you said that �to be a servant is the conclusion of all philosophies,� it struck me very deeply. It felt like the distilled truth behind everything I have ever read or attempted to understand. To the degree we try to sincerely imbibe this spirit of service, Krishna reciprocates and cleanses the heart. Hearing this from someone who has personally walked through those philosophies and realized their essence is an immense blessing that I still cannot fully comprehend.\n\nI remember my guide, HG Hari Bhakti Prabhu, once telling me that to be a disciple means to have the dedication to follow instructions and be accountable to the spiritual master. Those words have stayed with me like a compass to keep checking when I drift. I definitely do not walk the path perfectly, but I aspire to cultivate that spirit of responsibility, both in following the instructions given to me and in aligning my life with your teachings.\n\nYou speak about cultivating the eyes of love, *premanjana-churita-bhakti-vilocanena*. I know I do not have such vision, yet by your mercy, I feel I am allowed to see glimpses of that wonderful Damodara through your eyes. Whatever little taste or inspiration I have received has come by showering myself with your Vani, not by any qualification of my own. This is something I remain deeply grateful for.\n\nAnother teaching from you that continues to shape my mind is your explanation of envy and its absence in Vindavan. You described how in Vrindavan everyone simply wants to please Krishna, and if someone else can render a service better, they are joyfully put forward. This simple yet profound mood is the real cure for envy. It gives me a direction for what I should actually cultivate in my own heart.\n\nYour example makes even lofty ideals feel practical. You show us that humility is not weakness, gratitude is not sentimentality, and service is not mere activity; it is identity. I want to live my life in a way that reflects even a drop of that understanding.\n\nMy deepest aspiration is to embrace the mood you embody so naturally, to be the servant of the servant. I pray that this aspiration becomes real, not just something I recite, but something I ingrain. I pray for the sincerity to follow your instructions and those of your representatives wholeheartedly, without excuses.\n\nThank you for giving meaning to every struggle and hope in my spiritual journey. Thank you for allowing me to stand anywhere near the shelter of your feet. I remain forever grateful and pray for the strength to serve your mission and your devotees with integrity.\n\nYour insignificant aspiring servant,\nAnand."

Honestly, I have no qualifications, but your causeless mercy keeps me on the path of devotional service. I am simply trying my best to please the devotees around me with whatever little capacity I have.\n\nI was reflecting on the recent Kartik Yatra.

All glories unto You.\n\nI recently had the great fortune of listening to Your lecture entitled �Stop Worrying, Start Living� at Mumbai, in which You so kindly addressed the young generation with profound wisdom and compassionate clarity. With folded hands, I convey my deep gratitude for the life-giving message You have given.\n\nIn Your talk, You emphasized that much of our wasted energy arises from incessant worry�worry about the future, worry about our relationships, our image, our security. You reminded us that our real identity is not merely this body or the material framework, but a divine soul, eternally connected with the Supreme. I was especially struck when You said that to stop worrying is not merely to push away anxiety, but to replace it with true aim and service�living for something larger than our personal fears.\n\nThat single insight has already begun to shift something in my heart. I have noticed how when I worry about some outcome, I shrink inward, distracted from serving others, from remembering the Lord, from participating in the divine play. But Your words encouraged me: rather than being defined by problems, I can define myself by devotion, by love, by offering whatever I have to the Lord and His servants.\n\nDear Gurudev, I make this humble offering to You of my heartfelt resolve:\n\nTo recognize more deeply that I am a spiritual being and so free of ultimate entanglement in material results.\nTo channel my energy into loving service: helping others, supporting the mission, connecting with the devotees in a spirit of humility and sincerity.\nTo remember the Lord and chant faithfully, so that even when challenges arise I can �shift gears� from worry-mode into remembrance-and-service-mode, as You advised.\n\nYour compassionate presence and Your teaching are guiding lights for me. I pray that by Your mercy I may gradually become more peaceful within, more steady in my purpose, more joyful in devotional service. And I earnestly ask that You accept this offering of my sincere intention and weak endeavor. I am aware that without Your mercy and the mercy of the Lord, I can neither stop worrying nor truly begin living in the highest sense.\n\nPlease kindly accept my humble pranams at Your Lotus Feet and pray for me so that I may become a stronger instrument of this message: that genuine living begins when we surrender worry and step into selfless devotion.\n\nWith endless gratitude and unconditional service,\n\nYour pitiable servant,\nVrajendra Kishor Das"

Whether you speak to a common villager in Maharashtra, to the senators at the House of Commons, or to your loving disciples, you always find a way to focus on this essence through all the superficialities. You always speak of focusing on this essence in every situation of life and in every person, just like a honeybee focuses on the nectar of honey in a lonely flower without getting distracted by all the superficialities existing around it. Indeed, this essence is the common fabric that connects all the living entities to the singular purpose of loving service to Krishna � �jvera �svarpa� haya � kera �nitya-dsa�� (CC Madhya 20.108). Maharaj, it is miraculous to see how by focusing on this essence, you gain the appreciation and confidence of everyone, irrespective of their profession, status of life, nationality, religion, philosophical beliefs, race, or gender. Maharaj, I aspire to follow your divine instructions in this regard to be able to focus on this essence of pure bhakti amidst all the turbulence and distractions in this world. I wish to focus on this essence in every person I meet, disregarding all their apparent shortcomings and worldly distractions. And most importantly, by your kind mercy, I aspire to focus on this essence in every limb of bhakti. Indeed, without focusing on this essence, I can see that any spiritual practice would not lead me to the highest desired benefit.\n\nGurumaharaj, you are an embodiment of humility and service attitude. You teach and live by the principle of serving and pleasing devotees without any expectations in return. In every lecture of yours, you focus on the principle of being the servant of the servant of devotees and the verse td api suncena. Maharaj, you have personally set a very high example of this principle. In the Radha Gopinath temple, you focused on this aspect so much that the devotees live together in a community with the only aspiration to serve other devotees selflessly. You have established very high standards for guest care and devotee care. Some examples include having central air-conditioning in the temple hall and deity kitchen, very high prasadam standards, a separate kitchen for guest devotees, special care and engagement for elderly devotees and children, and special programs for youth are some of the few points to name. During the Kartik yatra where more than 12,000 devotees participate, you made sure that no devotee needs to wait for more than 5 minutes for getting their prasadam plate. Even then, you ensured that for the 5 minutes for which the devotees need to wait, they should get to stand in a pandal, so they do not have to face the sun. Maharaj, it is heart-warming to see your humility and simplicity in dealing with your godbrothers. You show by your example how we should always wear the garland of td api suncena while dealing with devotees. You always make sure to pass any credit that comes to you to Srila Prabhupada and the previous acharyas. During the South India yatra, when you were given special recognition by the Srirangam temple Vaishnavas by offering you a lot of worship by seating you on an elephant, you immediately offered all the glory to Srila Prabhupada. Maharaj, your unwavering determination to fulfill the desire of Prabhupada is unimaginable. Despite the innumerable challenges, you were persistent in establishing the Govardhan eco-village as an offering to Srila Prabhupada to fulfill his desire to establish farm communities. Maharaj, though you have established such a huge community in India where you could retire in the association of your loving disciples, you have taken the responsibility to travel worldwide to inspire many in the path of bhakti, trying to fulfill Prabhupada�s focus on an �international� society. There are thousands of devotees who gather to hear each of your talks in India; on the other hand, sometimes you only have an audience of a few tens while you speak in New York. In either case, you always have the same intensity of loving service to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nMaharaj, you show such a high example of personal detachment and subordination to authority. You took up unimaginable services during your stay at New Vrindavan in the initial days. In those days, you would hardly get to sleep a couple of hours between the offerings. Later, you traveled all through North America establishing college preaching far and wide. Then you were told to go to India and establish the preaching there. At that time, the preaching you had established in the colleges in America was flourishing far and wide, but as soon as the instruction came, you left all of that and returned to India. When you returned to India in 1987, you were entrusted with a small, dilapidated, one-room ashram in Mumbai. The few existing ashramites were engulfed in bitterness and scandal and were at war with the surrounding congregation. You took charge of the situation and carefully invested your time and energy, practically your entire life, to cultivate the community of devotees. In those days, you would give a program in the morning at the temple, have special classes for the brahmacharis in the afternoon, and a program for the congregation every day. You focused on cultivating devotees according to their inclinations and interests in seva. Eventually, you had inspired several of your disciples to be leaders in assisting you in building the community. After a lot of committed endeavor blessed with Krishna�s grace, you established a thriving community with several satellite centers, hundreds of brahmacharis, and tens of thousands of congregation members. It is for the service and engagement of the devotees in the congregation that you pioneered the establishment of the Bhaktivedanta hospital, Gopal school, orphanage, prasadam distribution program, and several other initiatives.\n\nMaharaj, I am very grateful to your disciple Radheshyam Prabhu, by whose efforts I could receive the opportunity to be a part of the VOICE system which introduced me to the path of bhakti. Due to this system, I could stay with sincere devotees and cultivate pure devotional service during my college education in Chennai. I am also so much indebted to my counselor Amal Mahaprabhu Prabhu, who has been so instrumental in helping me progress in the path of bhakti by systematically teaching me shastras and inspiring me to put them into practice.\n\nMaharaj, with the help of some wonderful friends at my university, we were able to host several programs including talks by HH Romapada Swami and Chaitanya Charan Prabhu. We had 40+ students join for these programs and connect to the path of bhakti. We also host weekly sessions as a part of the Bhakti Circle whereby we have a few students join us and experience the joy of devotional service. Gurudeva, I would like to offer all these endeavors unto your lotus feet. We also seek your blessings by which we can continue to host several more programs in the future and inspire many students to practice pure devotional service!\n\nMaharaj, I am so much indebted to you for setting such an amazing example of how we should put our hearts into each and every limb of bhakti we practice. I was so much inspired to see the helplessness with which you chant the holy names while I received the opportunity to chant in your association for a short duration during the Sadhu Sangha retreat in Dallas. Maharaj, by your blessings, I wish to take this resolution to at least aspire to chant with the same mood daily. I also commit that except in unavoidable situations, I will chant at least 12 rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra in the morning before I leave for my daily responsibilities. Maharaj, you always focus on reading Srila Prabhupada's books and living by those books. I get so much inspiration when I hear how you would somehow or other make the time to read Srila Prabhupada's books while you were engaged in many services during your stay at New Vrindavan. At one instance, you would have Prabhupada�s book on the side to read them while you were milking the cows, since that is the only time you would get for the same! Maharaj, I am so happy to inform you that by your mercy, I am able to read Prabhupada�s books consistently for the past 7 years. Maharaj, I am currently reading the 10th canto. Maharaj, I want to commit that I will read Prabhupada�s books for at least 30 minutes every day. Gurudeva, you have given your heart and soul in giving thousands of lectures over the last 35 years. Maharaj, when your disciple comes to you for asking for personal instructions, you often point them to your lectures, informing them that you have given all your personal instructions in your lectures. Gurumaharaj, I feel so unfortunate that I am not able to receive this mercy of yours coming in the form of your lectures. I want to take the commitment that I will hear your lectures with one-pointed attention for at least 30 minutes every week!\n\nMaharaj, I feel myself so unqualified and unworthy of receiving your mercy. I am constantly being crushed by all my anarthas, including the anartha of false pride which you very much despise. But I have no other hope other than to pray for a drop of your causeless mercy, which is the only way by which I can somehow focus on the goal of pure devotional service without being carried away by any of the distractions. Maharaj, I offer my humble and heartfelt prayers to Sri Sri Radha Krishna, Gaura Nitai, and all our wonderful acharyas so that you may have very good health for many more years to come, so that you can inspire countless souls in the path of pure bhakti. Maharaj, I want to conclude with an excerpt from a lecture that I heard sometime back, which I want to keep as my aspiration for being the servant of the servant of the servant of devotees!\n\nQuestion to Maharaj: You were mentioning how we must be so thankful to those who help us in making even the slightest spiritual advancement. Whenever you are here, you are inspiring us so much by your lectures and kirtans, so how can we repay the debt which we owe you\nAnswer: Actually, I am doing nothing, but your sentiments are very nice. If you want to do something to repay, you serve one another and love one another, put aside all the criticisms, and really try to be the true brothers and sisters of one another and thereby make this congregation a loving family of servants of Radha Gopinath. That is how you can best repay. In fact, that's all we want. Just try to purify yourselves in this mood of loving relationships because that will create an atmosphere that will attract the world to the lotus feet of Krishna. Prabhupada said you show your love for me by how you cooperate with each other, so ultimately our debt is to him: to be a humble servant of Vaishnavas and strive to purify ourselves by chanting the holy names.

Because of him, we have received such a compassionate and exalted spiritual master like you.\n\nGuru Mahrj, you often say that when a person works without any expectation of name and fame, that person becomes truly powerful. Whenever I see you, I remember this teaching, because you embody it completely.\n\nI feel extremely fortunate that from my engineering college days I received the association of ISKCON Chowpatty. I first saw the beautiful forms of r r Rdh Gopinath in a photograph in 2016, and after six long years, I was blessed to see Them personally for the first time during your rmad Bhgavatam class at Chowpatty in 2022. That moment changed my life.\n\nGuru Mahrj, you once shared a profound teaching from rla Prabhupda. When he was travelling on a road under construction, he saw a sign:\n�Temporary inconvenience for permanent convenience.�\nYou beautifully explained how this applies perfectly to spiritual life�how the temporary inconvenience of waking up early, chanting attentively, and following discipline ultimately leads us to our eternal spiritual progress and permanent position at Ka�s lotus feet. These words remain etched in my heart.\n\nJust by your glance, one�s heart transforms. Your smile melts the pride of conditioned souls and awakens devotion within them.\n\nSince 2022, I have been attending the Kartik Yatra, and every year your narrations of the Lord�s divine lls make my chanting taste like sweet butter. Your voice in krtan feels as if it descends from the spiritual world itself�touching the soul and awakening it from the deep entanglement of material life.\n\nGuru Mahrj, even amidst your physical discomfort and difficult health, you continue to give us your association and teach us how to live the essence of td api suncena�to be humbler than a blade of grass�and taror iva sahiun�to be as tolerant as a tree. Your life is a living commentary on these verses.\n\nYou have given us many priceless gems, and especially servants like HG Gauranga Prabhu and HG Radheyshyam Prabhu, who are taking care of ISKCON with such dedication and depth. Their leadership reflects your true servant-leader mood�where a real leader creates more leaders and remains a humble servant.\n\nThank you so much, Mahrj, for your constant compassion, guidance, and shelter. I am earnestly aspiring to take initiation from you. I am sincerely trying to follow the four regulative principles and chant 16 rounds daily.\n\nPlease bless me that I may become a fit servant of your lotus feet.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nDheeraj Vibhute"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Gurudev,\nPlease accept my obeisances at your lotus feet.\n\nTo write an offering to you is one of the toughest for me. The reasons are many, but the foremost among them is that I am really one of your most insignificant and worthless disciples to have received your grace. And throughout my life, I have been saved repeatedly through your grace. Saved in terms of repeatedly being able to attend the yatras, doing some insignificant services at the local congregation, being able to serve the Pujaris of Sri Sri Lakshmi Narayan, and sometimes serving those doing deity worship on the altar of your beloved Sri Sri RadhaGopinathji. And as I recollect my association with Sri Sri RadhaGopinath mandir, which began roughly about 2 decades ago, I cannot help but get overwhelmed at what an amazing abode of Vaikuntha you have erected. I simply cannot thank you enough for this. When I look back, I only realize how fortunate I have been because of all this. And then I realize how all of this could simply not have been possible without you.\n\nMaharaj, as someone who has been around for so long, I simply have not advanced as your disciple as I should have. I am so spiritually so very lethargic that I always give in to laziness and struggle with spiritual discipline and sincerity. I am surrounded by my amazing wife Madhuri Radhika, who for me is an epitome of sincerity and dedication that a disciple should possess; my mother Saibya dd, who is no different; and particularly my late father Priya Bhakta Prabhu, who left this world last year amidst the chanting of the holy names and who actually saw Srila Prabhupada during his final days in the ICU at Bhaktivendanta hospital. And Srila Prabhupada told my father, �We are going to Vrindavan.� I pray to my father almost daily to infuse me with the sincerity and dedication that he always had towards your instructions, sadhana, and Srimad Bhagwatam.\n\nDear Gurudev, a dull-headed person that I am, after so long, only now have I learned that the only way to achieve love for Guru and Krsna is to be constantly in touch with their instructions. I feel ashamed of myself when I see the senior devotees and your disciples serving you so lovingly. I wish to be like them, but I simply lack those qualities, especially that of serving you with love and dedication. Thereby, I have started the first step of practicing to listen to Hari Katha daily through your lotus mouth (recorded lectures and kirtans) and those of Srila Prabhupada. I know that you will simply be more pleased if I hear your beloved Guru Maharaj�s lectures too, along with yours.\n\nDear Gurudev, I request you to kindly forgive me for my immature, silly, and childish offering. I have simply just poured out my feelings. I just hope, and I pray to Srimati Radharani, that if possible, may you not abandon me due to my silly, fallen nature and behavior.\nMay I also request you to kindly grant me the strength, enthusiasm, and sincerity to be able to be in touch with your vaani for the rest of my life. Also, kindly empower me to be of some service to you because, on my own, I�m prone to falldowns, lethargy, and failures.\n\nYour most insignificant servant,\nBhaja nitai das"

All glories to Sri Guru and Gauranga.\n  Maharaj, I have never interacted with you in person. The only interaction I have had with you is when you gave classes. You spoke, and I heard. I could even hear only a few of your classes live, sitting in the audience. Most of the guidance I received from you is through your recorded classes. But still, I consider myself very fortunate that I could hear you. Maharaj, when you speak in classes, my experience is that you speak something which I would have never imagined or never learned anywhere else. You speak certain philosophical points which really give me the feeling of eyes actually opening to knowledge (Cakshu Unmilitam). Many times, I have this realization that my birth was actually in the darkness of ignorance, and then you are opening my eyes and bringing me to light. If you and your disciples had not come into my life, I would have lived my life in that ignorance. Recently, I heard one of your classes on anartha, and you were speaking about envy. In that class, you mentioned how I am envious of Lord Krishna. You proved to me that although I call myself a devotee of Krishna, I actually have a big disease of being envious of Krishna because I want to enjoy, control, and own things. Now I at least know this because of you, and with your mercy, I hope to get rid of this disease from my heart.

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nMaharaj, your divine appearance day celebration this year is very special and historical.\nThis year began with the historical celebration of Maha Kumbha Mela which appeared after 144 years, occurring only once in our lifetime.\n\nThis year also marked the 60th anniversary of the historical event of Srila Prabhupada boarding Jaladuta and leaving for the West for creating a worldwide revolution, which is occurring only once in our lifetime.\n\nThis year is ending with the historical celebration of the 75th divine appearance day of your holiness who left the Western world to assist Srila Prabhupada in his worldwide revolution, which is occurring only once in our lifetime.\n\nMaharaj, this confluence of Triveni Sangam itself is happening once in our lifetime, and hence we are unlimitedly fortunate and blessed to witness these events unfolding together in our lifetime.\n\nAs per the Samvatsar calendar, which has a cycle of 60 years, this year is the same year when Srila Prabhupada boarded the Jaladuta. In the historical year of 1965, when Srila Prabhupada boarded the Jaladuta, the Samvatsar year was �Vishvavasu�. The same Samvatsar �Vishvavasu� has come again this year in 2025 after 60 years. Hence, as per the Samvatsar, this year is the first anniversary of the historical event of Srila Prabhupada boarding Jaladuta, which will indeed be the only anniversary for us in our lifetime.\n\nSrila Prabhupada travelled in different countries across the world as a cultural ambassador with a message of world peace and global unity. Continuing Srila Prabhupada�s legacy, over these decades you have offered your unparalleled contribution in expanding Srila Prabhupada�s message of world peace and global unity across the world.\n\nAt a young age of 17, you left the comforts of the Western world with practically no money and resources and hitchhiked to India, risking your life in search of God. In India, you lived a life of a monk and dedicated your life to the welfare of society, as you had promised to the guard while requesting him to allow you to enter the borders of India.\n\nWhile we are fortunate to be blessed by your holy association, we would like to seek this opportunity to assist you in humbly offering our insignificant contribution at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nDear Maharaj, on the occasion of your 75th appearance day, this fallen soul humbly seeks your blessings and begs for your causeless mercy so that we can at least try to offer our insignificant contribution in your service to spread the message of world peace and global unity. While praying for your blessings, we very well know that the contribution which we are trying to offer you is nothing compared to the contribution you have made to the world in service to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nMaharaj, when you came to India for a higher cause, you were alone; we are many. You were penniless; we are earning. You had no place to reside; we have our homes. You physically endured hardships travelling across the world; the world for us is just a click away. Yes, Maharaj, today, with the advancement of technology, we have all comforts and luxuries to assist you in offering our contribution of taking Srila Prabhupada�s message across the world, still our contribution is insignificant because although:\n\n- We do have all the comforts of reaching out to the world from our homes, but we don�t have the compassion which you give to the world in service to Srila Prabhupada.\n- We do have all the luxuries to connect with people through technology, but we don�t have the love with which you connect with people across the world in service to Srila Prabhupada.\n- We do have all the facilities to take Srila Prabhupada�s message across the world, but we don�t have the faith you have in your Guru�s instruction to spread his message across the world.\n\nMaharaj, we have nothing to offer you. We only have Srila Prabhupada�s words in the form of his prayer which we can offer you so that if we receive your causeless mercy then we can at least hope to have some qualification so that we can have something to offer to the world. I don�t have the qualification to offer prayers directly to the Lord, but by your causeless mercy, I know I can offer you Srila Prabhupada�s prayers which he offered to the Lord just before he created a worldwide revolution.\n\nMaharaj, I humbly beg for your causeless mercy so that we can try to assist you in offering our insignificant contribution of taking Srila Prabhupada�s message of world peace and global unity to the world.\n\nI know your causeless mercy can make everything possible because you are the most expert mystic. I am very unfortunate, unqualified, and the most fallen. Therefore, I am seeking your benediction so that I can convince them, for I am powerless to do so on my own.\n\ntabe jadi taba krip� hoy ahaituk�\nsakala-i sambhava hoy tumi se kautuk�\nkshudra �mi d�na h�na kono s'akti n�hi\n\nI don�t have any power and qualification on my own. However, my only qualification is that I want to try to give my best to fulfill your instruction to assist you in your service to Srila Prabhupada.\nO my Master, I am just like a puppet in your hands. So, if you have asked me to dance, then make me dance, make me dance, O my Master, make me dance as you like.\n\n�niy�cho jadi prabhu �m�re n�c�te\nn�c�o n�c�o prabhu n�c�o se-mate\nk�shthera puttali jath� n�c�o se-mate\n\nAn insignificant puppet begging for your causeless mercy,\nJaigopal das"

My heartfelt and sincere prayers to Krishna that may you cross a century!\n\nMaharaj, I joined ISKCON when I was only 5 years old. By the mercy of His Divine Grace Abhay Charanarvinda Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupad, I developed a spiritual habit of reading books. Today I am 17 years old and I can surely say that by his mercy only I could complete one-time reading of Shrimad Bhagavad-gita, Shrimad-Bhagavatam, and Sri Chaitanya-charitamrita. When initially my knowledge started questioning Gaudiya philosophy, and as I was keenly interested to know more about Prabhupad, I started reading about his disciples as well. I am from ISKCON Ravet, and all brahmacharis here are disciples of Maharaj, so obviously the first book I chose was \"Truthart Pathik,\" the Marathi translation of \"Journey Home.\" It is Krishna's plan only that travelling so long to Bharat to find about God, he came till here through various experiences and difficulties. He faced nothing in front of mine. His search for self-realization has taught me to never complain about my life. Next, I read \"Antaricha Diva,\" the second book. This book also shared Maharaj's wisdom as a leader of ISKCON. This book enlightened me to wake up to my reality of being a soul and have some spiritual interest for my own benefit only. Since 2017, I have been attending Maharaj's Kartik Yatra. Listening to Maharaj is a God-gift. His verbal power can be seen that at this age also he can give lectures for long, long hours. Maharaj always tells devotees what we should learn from the pastimes of the Lord. The claps at the end of the lecture create such high vibration, it creates power. Ecstatic kirtan performed by Maharaj, how can I forget that Enthusiasm and young spark, it's still alive in him. Who says he's old Maharaj showered blessings upon my father this year on Sri Rama-chandra Vijaya Utsav and gave him the spiritual name: Vitthal Bihari Das. I still have goosebumps when I hear that voice. My sincere request to Maharaj that may his blessings reach upon me and my mother as well because we have accepted him as spiritual master in mind and heart already. Thank you so much Maharaj! Jay Prabhupad!"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna\nDandavat Pranam\nALL GLORIES TO SRILA PRABHUPADA\nALL GLORIES TO YOU SRILA GURU MAHARAJ\nI pray to Lord Sri Nityananda, who is Adi Guru, to bestow His divine mercy upon me so that I may try my best to express my sincere gratitude to my beloved Spiritual Master and His loving devotee HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj (Srila Guru Maharaj).\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, please accept my humble obeisances.\nOnce I had a question in my mind, that nowadays the personal (Vapu) association of Guru has become most rare...  ... and then how can one who is a neophyte aspiring devotee serve and understand the mood of Guru Maharaj\nAnd to this question, my beloved Shiksha Guru and loving and sincere disciple of Guru Maharaj, HG Vamsi Mohan Prabhu, explained it so wonderfully. He said, \"We can hear and serve the representatives of Guru Maharaj. They can teach us, guide us, encourage us, and most essentially, if we genuinely serve them, then they, with compassion, help us to understand the deeper mood of Guru Maharaj.\"\nAnd truly, Maharaj, this statement was so true and powerful that I have experienced it many times in my life.\nOut of unlimited and causeless mercy on a conditioned and degraded soul like me, You, Guru Maharaj, have blessed me with the association of so many of Your wonderful, sincere, and dedicated disciples that they are most mercifully uplifting everyone around them by repeating Your Vani as it is. Amongst them is Your beloved disciple, HG Vamsi Mohan Prabhuji. Practically the most humble person that I have ever met in my life. Every single ingredient of bhakti that a neophyte person needs is all I have been receiving from Prabhuji. He is just repeating Your Vani and always giving me deeper and deeper insights of Your teachings. Always filled with divine motivation, mercy, and love, he always encourages me to take the shelter of Your Vani in every circumstance. As You always, in all Your classes, emphasize two most important aspects of devotion: 1. More humble than a blade of grass, to be as tolerant as a tree, to give all respect to others and accept nothing in return. And 2. To be always striving to serve in the mood of a SERVENT OF THE SERVENT OF THE SERVENT OF THE SERVENT.....\nYour sincere and loving disciple, HG Vamsi Mohan Prabhuji, is actually the personification of these two aspects.\nI feel most fortunate and blessed to be in his association, and he, at every step, encourages me to take Your shelter and always helps me to attach my consciousness at Your lotus feet.\n\nMaharaj, through Your classes, You not only teach the deepest philosophy of the most rare Krishna Consciousness but at the same time, You give Krishna to everyone. You make everyone understand and feel that Krishna is everyone's shelter. Also, You encourage all Your disciples to do the same, i.e., to give Krishna to everyone.\nThis spirit I experienced most strongly while assisting one of the most dedicated aspiring devotees, Esha mataji, in the 2024 book marathon. She was not only trying to distribute the books but was trying to give every single individual an amazing and never-to-be-forgotten experience where they could appreciate the divine atmosphere of the temple and take up Krishna Consciousness. This made a very deep impact in my heart that how Your disciples repeat Your words through their actions.\n\nMaharaj, I remember one of the most profound pastimes narrated by HG Ishwar Gaurang Prabhuji.\nOnce, a few Brahmacharis at Chowpatty temple came to You and asked to motivate the entire congregation for the upcoming Book Marathon. There, Your answer to them was the most wonderful I have ever heard to this date.\nYou said to them, \"You all may distribute much more books than last year, but yet, I pray that you all should rank last, so that other devotees must distribute more and more books and ultimately must increase the Book Distribution score.\"\nBut when, a few days later, HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj came to Mumbai to motivate devotees for the Book Marathon, then again, all the devotees came to You and asked for blessings that they may distribute more and more books than previous years, and then You blessed them by saying: \"May you all distribute more and more books this year and get the rank 1st.\"\nAnd upon hearing this, everyone was shocked, and then You explained that..... \"Although we distribute books every year, we never rank first. But because this year HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj motivated us, we got so charged, motivated, and boosted that the loosers like us got the rank first, only and only because of the empowerment of HH Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj.\"\nSuch a deeper and insightful spirit, Maharaj, you expressed that for the rest of my life, I can never forget this Bhava or attitude that you inculcated in all of Your disciples.\n\nHH Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaj expressed in his glorification of Yours that you always try to serve in a way that you always try not to come into the limelight or to be recognized. But always endeavoring to serve in the most insignificant way or in a way in which you may not be recognized by the crowd. But Krishna's arrangements are so wonderful that when He desires to glorify His devotees, He does so. And today, not only in our SP's moment but all over the world, we can see and feel the impact that you have made on society. Carrying the teachings of SP, you are mercifully giving Krishna to everyone, every single living entity whomever encounters You.\nAlso, inculcating the same spirit in Your disciples.\n\nMaharaj, I am unlimitedly grateful to you for all your wonderful association through your divine and merciful and empowering Vani. Also, every year, You arrange a transcendental Kartik Yatra where you bless everyone with Your Vani association and also the warm and soothing presence, making every single devotee's Kartik month filled with spiritual nourishment and deeper and wonderful realizations.\nI strongly believe that only because of Your causeless mercy upon me, I received the opportunity to attend this divine Kartik Yatra, and I eagerly wait for attending more and more.\n\nMaharaj, I am a completely insignificant and degraded, unqualified soul. What can I pray But I pray at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Vrindavanchandra Bhagavan to encourage me to serve Your Vani most sincerely. May all Your instructions be my life and soul. May I just develop the bhava of a menial servant of the servant, and in the same mood, may I always serve all the Vaishnavas. May I develop a drop of eagerness and sincerity to contribute some little service in this great moment of our Beloved SP. In the most humble mood, may I always serve my loving Shikshaguru and Your beloved and dedicated disciple, HG Vamsi Mohan Prabhu.\nI pray, Lord, that I always be deep-rooted in Your instructions and desire.\n\nPlease forgive me for all my shortcomings, offenses, and mistakes and irresponsible attitude toward the devotional path. Maharaj, You can kick me, slap me, chastise, do everything that You feel appropriate for or You desire. Maharaj, I just pray, Maharaj, please never reject me, never.\n\nSeeking Your Shelter\n\nYour Aspiring Servant of the Servant...\nSanika"

My first yatra with you was to Vrindavan, where you did parikrama with all of us. You narrated the pastimes and gave lectures at all the important spots, and we completed the parikrama in two days. As a child, that was my first yatra, and I enjoyed the kirtan after class. Till today, I always wait for the after-class kirtan in yatras. We then had the opportunity for your association when you came for an GBC meeting to Ahmedabad. You came to our house for prasadam, and I was shocked and happy when you saw my drawing on the door. Just seeing that, you came to my room and blessed me. That moment became the best moment of my life. Once, during a Mayapur yatra, my friend and I had just thought of seeing if we could meet you for even just two seconds, and by Lord Chaitanya's mercy, you came walking towards us. As kids in the 9th or 10th standard, we were nervous and scared, thinking about what to tell you. We just asked you what, as children, could make you happy, and you smilingly told us, \"Just chant.\" When I first read *The Journey Home*, the best part that inspired me was the mongoose story, where the mongoose sat around your neck the whole night, and you did not move for one full night. Even in the morning, until the mongoose did not leave, you remained in the same position.\nThank you, Maharaj, for giving your mercy and blessings to us in the form of lectures and for the guidance you provided through the counselor system. Thank you for this.\n\nYours,\nFalguni"

You are the embodiment of humility, compassion, and simplicity. Your lectures, your teachings, and the way you deliver Krishna�s message have the power to transform anyone�s heart and purify their thoughts and life.

You said that friendship among devotees is the mercy of Krishna, and truly it is so. Without the association of devotees, one cannot grow in Bhakti. You place great importance on devotee association and always honor your Godbrothers and Godsisters with utmost respect, teaching us through your life what true Vaishnava etiquette is.\n\nMaharaj, I have also heard from your disciples how tolerant, compassionate, and merciful you are toward every living entity. In that same merciful mood, I humbly beg you to kindly tolerate my shortcomings, be merciful upon me, and accept me as your aspiring devotee.

There was an instance where you were initiating one mataji, and accidentally you said the initiated name and then said \"das\" instead of \"devi dasi\". You immediately corrected yourself and said, \"Oh, sorry! I am your das and your name is ___ devi dasi.\" Here, I could understand the humility you had. In front of everyone, at that particular time when everyone was accepting you as their spiritual master, you still retained the mood of servant of servant of servant.\n\nIn the Kartik Yatra, on the day of Prabhupad's disappearance, Vaishashikha Pr had come, and you were with him, showing him around the whole Pandal. When you were exiting the Pandal and a car was waiting to take you back, Srila Prabhupada�s lecture started in the Pandal, and your face bloomed with joy.

My biggest weakness is that I know the problem and I know the solution, but laziness and lethargy hold me back. Please, Gurudev, bless me so that I may overcome these weaknesses and improve in this most essential aspect of spiritual life.\n\nOne of the highlights of my year is eagerly waiting for the deep, soul-stirring sakrtana during the Krtik Ytr. Your krtans are truly out of this world�the way You inspire us to cry out the Holy Names from the heart, forgetting everything of this material world, and dive deeper and deeper into the ocean of nma. I pray that someday I may chant with even a fraction of the love and absorption You exemplify.\n\nI know I have committed many apardhas and sins, and I am not qualified to chant in such a pure mood. But I am fully confident that by Your grace I will gradually overcome these obstacles.\n\nYour interactions with Your Godbrothers and Godsisters, Your gratitude, Your consistent appreciation, and Your ability to always see the good qualities in devotees are lessons I cherish deeply. Your broad-mindedness and compassionate heart never judge anyone by externals. You are constantly looking for ways to connect souls to rla Prabhupda and Their Lordships. This mood is Your continuous meditation.\n\nI pray that I may imbibe even the tiniest fraction of these qualities and become a sincere, serious devotee without ulterior motives.\n\nOn the professional front, by Your grace things are improving, though there is still a long journey ahead. We hope to establish ourselves as a leading brand in Luxury Sacred Trips�offering every client a devotional and fulfilling experience.\nOn the personal front, many challenges remain, but things are improving. I pray that, by Ka�s grace and Your blessings, these obstacles disappear so I can fully focus on the three topmost priorities of my life.\n\nOn this most auspicious day of Your Vysa-pj, I beg for Your forgiveness and Your blessings. May I truly become the disciple You want me to be and follow the vows I have taken before You until my last breath.\n\nThank You once again, Gurudev.\n\nYour insignificant servant of Your servants,\nJagannath Dham Das\nPune"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances unto your holy lotus feet,\nYour association is the greatest benediction in my life. This time when I came for the yatra at Govardhan, I felt I got my life back by seeing you. I was really feeling that I had gone a little away from you; this yatra has given me another hope. (darshane pavitra karo ei tomar guna).\nIn this yatra, your every word was filled with great realizations. You have given so much, Maharaj, that I can't even fathom the depth of that. Every moment you are so conscious of Krishna. This time I found one special thing, Maharaj, the way you were showing your gratitude to the devotees who were serving in this yatra. It taught me so many things, that how I should be grateful to you, devotees, parents, and everyone who is trying to serve Krishna.\nDear Maharaj, you have been one of the best recipients of Krishna in your life and also one of the best givers of Krishna, also. So many ways devotees are engaged in the mission of Shrila Prabhupada under your inspiration is unfathomable. Devotees are serving the society through the mediums of Hospitals, schools, college preaching, congregation preaching, Go-seva preaching, Food for Life, Annakshetra, Govardhan Skill Centre, farmers' cultivation, providing prasadam to the lacs of people during Kumbh Mela, Ayodhya temple opening, etc. The list is unlimited. �Krishna shaktivina nahi tar pravartan,� what is said in the Chaitanya Charitamrita exactly fits for you.\nYour love for Krishna is great. Your chanting is prayerful. Your personal sadhana is so deep. Your kirtans are so much filled with nectar. Your love for your god-brothers gives me great inspiration to serve Shrila Prabhupada�s mission with a lot of cooperation. Your love for mother cow gives me inspiration to serve them. Your love for Shrila Prabhupada is so high that in this age you are taking more responsibilities to please him; that also inspires me to go beyond my capacity to serve the mission.\nYour senior disciples are highly qualified. I had the association of HG Vishwaroop prabhu, HG Giriraj prabhu, HG Madhavanand prabhu closely. They are representing you very nicely. I need to learn a lot of things from them. They have given their lives for pleasing you. Their conduct is so ideal. They are one with your instructions. I need to serve your instructions seriously. I am in great need of it. Otherwise, I will be dragged by the ropes of material nature.\nI am in great need of hearing your classes regularly and seriously. Many years have passed; I am not hearing them seriously the way I used to hear them in my initial days. I am being tormented by the waves of Maya from right to left, top to bottom. Anarthas are troubling me many times. I know that your lectures are enough for me. But still, I am not taking it seriously. I need to find different means to hear your lectures regularly. Please bless me and give me strength to take shelter of them regularly. I am personally a great fan of yours, Maharaj. This is what has given me so much strength till now in my life and I don�t want to leave it.\nSince the last 2 years, I have taken service of youth preaching at Goa, which is giving great purification in terms of not getting results and not having proper dealings with the subordinates. Somehow, I am not able to maintain my quality of sadhana and services as compared to the quantity. Please show me the light to make these boys into devotees so that I can please HG Radheshyam Prabhu and you. Please give me intelligence by which I can serve them nicely so that they are closer to Krishna.\nGGD VOICE project has been better this year than last year. I think because we are at that place now where you had come personally around 25 years ago. Need to improve a lot in the quality of devotees. Narhe VOICE was a very nice engagement for me last 2-3 years. Now there are many problems at that place, as Abhinandan Prabhu is moving out to Baner mostly. There will be great problems, I know; for that, I need great strength to deal with all these things. One of the greatest helps I am getting is from HG Damodar Vinod Prabhu in preaching to the boys. He has some plans for the Goa boys also. Please bless us that we make these boys into devotees and get them connected to you and Shrila Prabhupada.\nMy personal life is as usual worse; not able to become humble. Not able to control senses. I am becoming fatter and fatter. Need to improve in that and become sincere to take care of the body as a service to the mission of Shrila Prabhupada. I think this will only work. Sadhana is worse, as after Chaitanya Charitamrita, I have not read any book properly. Recently, I have decided to dedicate 2-3 hours of the day for sadhana from 2 to 5 pm or from 5 to 8 pm. HDG Bhakti Siddhant Sarasvati Thakur has told to read Chaitanya Bhagvat 108 times; when will I complete that I beg for the mercy to feel the need for this. Also, I need to be regulated in eating and sleeping. I want to chant attentively and sitting at one place for 16 rounds at least. I wish to follow some austere vows so that I can remain simple and think about Krishna more. Sleeping early and getting up early has been a dream of mine since 15 years. I wish to get up at least at 3 am. Maharaj, please help; your mercy is the most important for me to accomplish these things to serve you nicely.\nParents are doing ok in terms of chanting and all. One great thing is they like our Kartik yatra, and their main attraction is your association. Especially, my mother is fond of you. She says that she just wants to hear VOICE. That gives her a lot of inspiration in bhakti. By the mercy of Shrila Prabhupada, she cooked 5-6 items for Shrila Prabhupada on the Disappearance day of Prabhupada. She was very excited to cook for Prabhupada. Thank you very much, Maharaj. It is my desire that they remember you regularly and follow you. Please shower your blessings upon them.\nI know I am not a worthy disciple of yours, and you are tolerating my all the shortcomings. But one day, I wish to represent you nicely in the mood of servants of your servants. Please, please, please forgive me for countless offenses.\nYour aspiring servant,\nSubal Priya Das"

    "Your Offering": "My dear Guru Maharaj, please accept my humble obeisances. I am very grateful for your lectures and what you said, that my personal instructions are in your lectures, and also your each action or movement is an instruction. So I am trying to follow that.\n\n1. In one talk, HG Amogh Leela prabhu asked you that Maharaj, why you don't have your deities Then you replied him that, \"My personal deities are my beads.\" And then he said that you change your bead bag on a daily basis, as in ISKCON we change deities' dress daily and keep a clean bead bag. So I am really inspired by hearing this, that the holy name and beads are the personal deities of each individual devotee, and we should respect them like deities only.\n\n2. Today I was hearing your lecture in which you were narrating the Kaliya Naag story, and in that, you said that Krishna forgave Kaliya Naag and said to him that now Garuda (death personified for snakes) will not touch you because my lotus feet impressions are there. By seeing them, Garuda will not touch you. Then you said that the Tilak on a devotee's forehead also compares to the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krishna. And Yamraj gave orders to his servants, \"Don't bring to me who chanted even once Lord Krishna's name.\" Then what to say about those who are Krishna's devotees\n\n3. HG Vishwaroop prabhuji was telling that Maharaj told them that we should give an asan to each paraphernalia which is used in the Lord's service because these are all Lord Balaramji's expansions in the form of that object. So he told that we should give an asan to the sound box till the time it is in an active state or in service.\n\nSo in this way, I am trying to focus on each statement and considering it as a personal instruction from you, Guru Maharaj, and trying to follow that as far as possible.\n\nOne time, I discussed this point with HG Antardweep prabhu and said that we can list down Guru Maharaj's statements or actions (like paying dandavat to Srila Prabhupada and offering flowers to the deities, serving and honoring prasad. In all these actions, your mood is always absorbed in thought of Krishna). And also, you said many times, \"How can I serve all of you by being a spiritual guide\" We can follow and apply these in our daily routine life, and in this way, we can follow your instructions as far as our best possible way on a daily basis and keep remembering you.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, please bless me on this auspicious occasion of your appearance day. As we heard that on appearance day, one is simply in a giving mood, so please give your blessings and mercy so that I can imbibe even a drop of good qualities from your ocean of good qualities.\n\nPlease forgive me for not being able to follow your basic instruction strongly, that is, attentive chanting and the four regulative principles. I am just completing the rounds grossly but not subtly following the four regulative principles.\n\nThank you very much, Guru Maharaj, for accepting me as your disciple even though I am not qualified.\n\nYour servant,\nAchintya Balaram Das"

In every experience and exchange, You could tap into divinity and hear the voice of Krsna. Clearly, this is the definition of a Mahatma.

Your discourses that unfold the profundities of pure devotional service can transform the aspirations of the most materialistic minds� your kirtans melt the most reluctant hearts, and your mercy can banish all illusory coverings.

Everything was better than the best that we experienced last year, be it the Kids Zone, Prasadam, or Dhaam Darshan, everything. Because of Your efforts, Vasudha could also develop a tinge of attraction for Vrinda Devi of Kamyavan, and Raaghav for the Yashoda Kund. Gurudev, please bless us so that these kids remain attracted to You and Krishna.\n\nGurudev, please bless me so that I may attempt to glorify You with true feelings of the heart and not limited to lip service, and without the inner motive of seeking glorification of my own attempt to glorify You.\n\nGurudev, You are the most transcendental storyteller. By Your potency and spiritual sound vibrations, even a fallen soul like me is not only able to hear but see all the pastimes of the Lord in your stories. Along with showing us the spiritual windows through your stories, you also so beautifully insert the important instructions required for a Sadhaka. One such instruction which I am able to understand through Your Katha is \"Selfless Devotion\". In one of the Yatra classes, You told that \"A devotee does not want to even enjoy Love of Godhead, but because it pleases Krishna, he desires for that.\" Gurudev, even after spending almost 20 years, I am still a selfish servant. Please bless me so that at least I could aspire for such a selfless devotion attitude.\n\nGurudev, Your Kirtans are like magnets. It is like if iron remains in touch with a magnet for some time, it also develops some quality of a magnet. While we are present in your Kirtan, it becomes so easy to feel attraction for Krishna. Even if I could continue to have a drop of that attraction which I feel in your presence, my life would be successful. Dear Gurudev, please bless me with that attraction.\n\nDear Gurudev, your love and respect for your Godbrothers and sisters is so exemplary, which we witness on many occasions. This year, during the Yatra inaugural lecture, after Your Mangalacharan Prayers, the moment you saw HH Sachinandan Swami Maharaj, you immediately invited him to bless all of us, and you are able to do it so naturally because your heart is full of love for Krishna and thus love for all. Gurudev, please bless me so that I could also have some love for my Godbrothers.\n\nDear Gurudev, I was fortunate to have Your Darshan at GEV last December. Out of so many wonderful arrangements and facilities there, we all could feel that GEV is nondifferent from Vrindavan. I could see one special quality of GEV: that You were specially happy there. Of course, you are always happy everywhere, but somehow, to my material vision, it appeared you were specially \"super happy like a Cowherd boy in the Vrindavan Forest of GEV.\" Please forgive me for this partial vision. Gurudev, on this special occasion, I pray to Shri Shri Param Karuna Gaur Nitai that He blesses You with a healthy and long life, and we get your association as our Transcendental Storyteller.\n\nYour Servant,\nVasudha, Raaghav, Srimati Kishori Devi Dasi and Vidwan Gauranga Dasa"

You embody everything that You make us strive for, and what is most important - You give us an example of what it means to be a disciple. Watching You, I dream that a day will come when I will also give You my heart, as You have given Yours to Srila Prabhupada, and that someday I will also give myself completely to following Your instructions.\n\nI am trying, but I feel so small and weak. I am taken away by the waves of the mind and senses. But Your feet are my anchor. Please let me hold on to it tightly and feel Your love.\n\nEach of Your disciples is unlimitedly dear to You, even though physically You cannot be with all of them. With such emotion, You always tell the story of how Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur refused to conduct a temple opening ceremony until one single brahmachari returned.\n\nYou are an embodiment of this story. No projects has ever meant to You more than even the most insignificant person You meet. You always see even the smallest service of the devotees and express Your gratitude. How many hours of Your life have You spent for communicating with people in Your attempt to help them become closer to Krishna! How many sleepless nights have You had, listening to all those who came to You to express their heart! You keep extending Yourself without limit for those who need it. And so many times You spoke of how You would like to be with all of You disciples personally 24/7, but it is humanly impossible.\n\nStill, I know that a sincere disciple can always be with his guru. Srila Prabhupada says that there can be no separation if a disciple tries to follow the instructions of his spiritual master. \"The spiritual master is present everywhere where a sincere disciple is trying to serve his instructions. It is possible by Krishna's mercy. In Your attempts to serve me and in all of You sincere devotional sentiments, I am with you as my Guru Maharaj is with me. Always remember that.\"\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, while writing all this, I understand I have nothing to say to You. You know my heart. Please let me, in spite of choosing words, start living in such a way that will please You. Once You told that true Vyasa-puja is when a devotee glorifies his spiritual master with his actions.\n\nPlease let my life become an offering to You and those dear to You. Please let me become Your instrument. By Your mercy, Krishna may fill this heart with love, and then I will be able to leave the prison of my selfishness and start giving love to others. Please let me make others' happiness the meaning of my life, and please make me qualified to help those who are dear to those who serve You.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nHari Priti dd"

So, Ram devotees kept telling you about Krishna, even though Rama katha was being narrated.

By your mercy�through your drops of compassion and divine teachings�you have given a new direction to my life. Your words not only impart knowledge but also purify the heart.\n\nYour greatness lies in the fact that you always see a glimpse of God in every living entity. Your simplicity, humility, and compassion teach us that we should perform bhakti with love, sincerity, and purity. From you we learn that we, too, should live in this world with dedication, service, and a pure heart. Seeing your selfless devotion inspires us to serve with sincerity.\n\nHH Bhakti Rasamrita Maharaj shared with us on the occasion of your Vyasa Puja how you have mastered the art of speaking�how your words have influenced countless lives.

After about half an hour, we suddenly heard that *you* would be visiting the Roti Department in five minutes. We immediately rushed back. At the entrance, your secretary, Pranavananda Prabhu, stopped us, but when we told him that we were serving in that department, he kindly allowed us inside.\n\nWhen we entered, everyone was busy in seva and there was no clear place for us to join. I went near the roti machine where a brahmachari from Vrindavan was removing rotis and applying ghee. I humbly requested him to allow me to apply ghee, but he refused. Just then, you arrived. You looked at that brahmachari, smiled, and expressed gratitude to him. You did not look at me at all.\n\nThe next day, we were again doing seva in the Roti Department. This time, when you came and I was genuinely engaged in service, you looked at me and smiled�your eyebrows softly twinkling. That small gesture taught me a profound lesson:\nNever pretend; always serve with sincerity and dedication.\n\nYours Servant\nSeemadevi Sandeep Singh\nSvarupa Ananda Das"

I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to glorify you even with my imperfect words. Every year, out of your causeless mercy, you give fallen souls like me the chance to speak something about you... though I know it is like showing a lamp to the sun or offering water to the ocean, still, Guru Maharaj, by your mercy, my words become free� my heart becomes free� and somehow, you allow me to express the gratitude I carry within.\nThank you Maharaj for organizing Kartik yatra every year. This 2025 Kartik Yatra to Govardhan was my first ever yatra in my Krishna Consciousness till now. And Maharaj, during this Kartik Yatra, something happened that left a deep mark on my heart. On the fourth or the fifth day of your lecture, you mentioned that the highest goal of our life is to please the hearts of the Brajvasis and the pure devotees of the Lord.\nI heard the words� but the next day, Krishna allowed me to experience them. It was rla Prabhupda�s disappearance day. We were doing Vraja parikrama, singing krtan, exhausted and thirsty. We stopped for sugarcane juice, and someone said, �Till the juice prepares, let us do some krtan.� So softly we began:\n�Rdhe Rdhe Govinda, Govinda Rdhe��\nSuddenly, from somewhere, a group of Brajvasis - elderly women and devotees from various Gaudiya parivras - came and became completely ecstatic. Their joy overflowed into us, and our small krtan transformed into a powerful, joyful festival of hearts.\nWhat to speak of those elderly women, even the sugarcane juice walla, street vendors, everyone became ecstatic.\nAfter krtan, those matajis came to bless us, with such wholehearted affection, with so many blessings, like a child loves pampers and blesses with her hands, that my heart felt full to overflowing. In that moment, I felt we had truly pleased the hearts of the Brajvasis. Your words were not a lesson anymore; they were a living reality. That blessing filled me with a sweetness I cannot describe. I never experienced that moment ever before.\n\nThose two minutes����\nMaharaj, due to some unavoidable circumstances, I joined the yatra a little late. On the very first morning japa, when I saw you a few steps ahead, I completely froze. For years I had only seen you online, and there you were, close, breathing the same air. I didn�t know what to do; my words left me. The whole yatra felt like a dream after that.\nAll through the days I kept trying to get a moment with you, to offer my feelings, my realizations, my gratitude, but it seemed impossible. On the last day, I prayed with all my heart: �Maharaj, even for a few seconds, please let me offer what I brought for you.� I had brought some mahprasd from Ayodhya as my offering. It looked like it would not be possible.\nBut, but by your mercy, you came right in front of me. I was speechless, shaking, unable to say even the simplest thing: �Maharaj, I brought an offering for you.�\nYou looked at me for complete 2 minutes, you spoke something, and those two minutes, just two minutes of your presence and attention, became the best two minutes of my life.\nI will carry them forever.\nAfter the yatra ended, I could not stay in the dhma even for a moment. I felt an unbearable separation, not just from you but from the devotees who had become my family. Many of them I had met only online before. Meeting them offline felt not like a first meeting but like a homecoming; it felt as if I belong to them and they belong to me. Their warmth, their mercy, their blessings, I do not have words. Being with them made my Krishna consciousness bloom; leaving them made my heart ache. Truly:\nIn your lectures I have heard that �we can only experience the real depth, real beauty of Krishna Consciousness in the association of devotees.�\nAlso Bhagwatam describes: �bhaktis tu bhagavat-bhakta-sagena parijyate.�\n�Devotional service to the Supreme Lord is awakened and nourished only by the association of His devotees.�\nAnd I really felt that. The separation was unbearable to such an extent that I really didn�t want to stay for even some minutes, that too in the Dham.\n\nMaharaj, once I heard your lecture where you said that �expressing gratitude is the womb of humility.� Those words remained in my heart, but during the yatra I saw them come alive through your own example. The way you thanked every devotee, every sevak, every organizer with such affection, respect, and sincerity, it felt as if you were personally teaching us how a true Vaiava honours everyone around him.\nSeeing that, Guru Maharaj, awakened a deep desire in me. I pray that one day I may develop even a tiny particle of the gratitude and humility that you embody so effortlessly. Inspired by your words, during the yatra I tried consciously to express gratitude to the devotees around me. And in those moments, I felt something changing within... as if a softer, more humble part of my heart was being uncovered by your mercy.\nMaharaj, whatever transformation begins in me is only because of your instructions. I pray that I may follow this teaching of yours more deeply, so that even in my small attempts, I may bring some glory to you and your mission.\nAnd thank you, Maharaj, for blessing us with your wonderful [messengers], His Grace Radheshyam Prabhu and His Grace Vaishnav Sharan Prabhu. Whatever I have today in my Krishna consciousness, it is by standing under the shade of their guidance. Many times, their corrections felt heavy, but later I understood they were actually saving me from myself.\nEspecially the association of Vaishnav Sharan Prabhu, I learned how gentle, how personal, and how affectionate, how caring a devotee can be.\nGuru Maharaj, through these two devotees, I feel your mercy constantly flowing toward me. Their presence in my life is one of the greatest gifts you have given me.\nOh Maharaj�\nDuring this yatra, I made some promise at your lotus feet. But today, honestly, I am still struggling to live that promise fully. My determination is weak, my habits pull me down, and my mind keeps distracting me.\nSo on this auspicious day, I beg you for just one boon:\nPlease bless me with the strength, enthusiasm, purity, and sincerity\nto fulfill the promise I made to you\nso I can serve you and your devotees in the best way possible.\nThis one more, this year, gift I want from you.\nThis is the only gift I want to offer back to you.\n\nOne of your most, most, most, most insignificant servant\nSatyam Gupta\nAyodhya"

A deep thought came to mind: Was I qualified to receive all these matchless gifts Certainly not, but you made my qualification and gave these gifts.\n\nDear Maharaj, the yatras which you take are so nectarean that during that period, we get a glimpse of the spiritual world, and this is only possible because of your hours and hours of prayers before Sri Sri Radha Gopinath.\n\nMaharaj, in every lecture, your focus is on \"trinadapi sunichena______\" and gratefulness, and Maharaj, we can see that you are an emblem of these qualities. Maharaj, one statement of yours that stuck with me is, \"If you want to love God, then you should learn to forgive.\" And then I realized, Maharaj, why so much stress on gratitude, because a grateful heart is a humble heart, and only a humble heart can forgive.\n\nMaharaj, while I was a student studying material subjects, we learned about so many revolutions created by sociologists for the betterment of society. In the same way, Maharaj, you also created a revolution in the misdirected lives of people by guiding them towards spirituality and made them best in the eyes of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, which is the topmost achievement. So, in that sense, Maharaj, you are the best revolutionist.\n\nMaharaj, your life is Srimad Bhagavad personified, and by your nectarean classes, you imbibe in us those teachings of Bhagvatam so sweetly, and that is true strength to practice devotional service. Tukaram Maharaj, in one of his Abhangas, says:\n\n     \n\n\"He who 'walks his talk' � I bow down to his feet.\"\n\nMaharaj, as you once said, \"I want to take all my disciples back home, back to Godhead.\" And Maharaj, you are here to give us Krishna, and practically, it is seen by your lectures and kirtans, you want everyone to absorb themselves in the spirit of Krishna consciousness. May one day I realize that you want me to be with Radha Krishna in this lifetime.\n\nMaharaj, lastly, what more can I say What I never thought about, I have got. You didn't give me what I liked, but you gave me what I need. May your 75th appearance day remind me of these matchless gifts which I have received. May I remain grateful forever, imbibe the principles of \"Trinadapi sunichena______,\" and share these gifts with others. And may I remain deeply attached to you.\n\n\"Vrindavan is near to you,\nSri Sri Radha Gopinath is dear to you,\nand misconceptions of life are cleared by you.\"\n\nThank you very much for everything.\n\nYour Eternal Servant,\nVraj Madhav Das"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nI have long desired to be in your association since the time when the Vaisnava community was celebrating your 50th anniversary. I always carried this aspiration within my heart, and even while being physically distant and unable to offer you my prostrated obeisances, I prayed for the mercy of Srila Prabhupada, through which I hoped to attain devotional service under your guidance and thus become qualified to be a servant of the servants of the servants of His Divine Grace.\n\nYou teach us to live each stage revealed in the r ikakam, transforming the feeling of separation from r Vndvana into an opportunity to manifest the Lord�s abode thousands of miles away from Vraja-bhmi. In this way, the forests of Vrindavan conceived on the banks of the Vaitarna River are compared to the fully matured fruit of your intense meditation. Accompanied by the loving service of thousands of devotees of r r Rdh-Madana-Mohana, this meditation reveals to people in general how you teach us to relish the highest stages of Krishna-bhakti: �adaranam marma-hata karotu v.�\n\nUpon returning to the United States, when you began to reside within the Vndvana manifested in the heart of Srila Prabhupada, your beloved spiritual master taught you the art of serving in separation, transforming the hills of Marshall County into the sacred dhma where the prema-bhaktas gather. By establishing Vndvana near the Ohio River, His Divine Grace taught us to understand that r r Rdh�Vndvana-candra are the Supreme manifestation who allow sincere devotees, even in this very lifetime, to enter into relationship with the eternal associates of the Divine Couple. For this reason, in his commentary on Akepa (Regret) by rla Narottama dsa hkura, Srila Prabhupada emphasizes: �Krishna means Krishna with His devotees. Krishna is never alone (...) Krishna Consciousness means to keep association with the devotees of Krishna.�\n\nTo keep this reality alive in your heart, you carry with you�like a garland�the third verse of the ikakam, teaching us the art of preserving taste and steadiness in the chanting of the Holy Names. You respect everyone and demand no respect for yourself, allowing your fully matured tree of bhaktir-ahaituk to bear fruits that sow love for the Divine Couple in the hearts of innumerable devotees. Inspired by your example, hundreds of thousands of beads forming the garlands of the Sakrtana Movement have been distributed throughout the world. Through these sacred beads, the devotees teach us that humility and tolerance are the true wealth required to attain the sublime position of servant of the servant of the servant of r r Rdh�Gopntha.\n\nWith the garland around our necks, you teach us to plunge into the waters of the ocean of bhakti-rasa. Separated from you by the ocean of material existence, I lament the lack of association with the devotees who serve you for the highest welfare of humanity. These devotees are my greatest inspiration in the service of r r Guru and Gaurga. Keeping them in my mind, I hope that one day I may overcome the lack of courage that prevents me from attaining the association of those souls who, under your guidance, learn to discover and preserve the true treasure of human existence.\n\nWhen will the day come when I may awaken to my original state of divine consciousness and thus become an instrument in your hands When that day arrives, I will have secured my place as the servant of the servants of the servants of the Guru-parampar of r Caitanya Mahprabhu.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nGaura Chandra das"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada!\n\nGurudev, with every passing year, we realize how very difficult it is to ever become a pure devotee. Our puffed-up egos and overflowing anarthas keep reminding us of how far we are from the goal of prema bhakti, or even the path of it. The struggle is real.\n\nThe only reason we still aspire for this exalted goal of being a devotee whose every thought, every word and every action is a pleasing offering to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath is because we have you as our Guru. Showing us the way, setting the example, gently and very patiently nudging us to follow in your footsteps.\n\nMaharaj, it is quite inconceivable for us Kaliyuga products to even imagine that we could have such a pure and completely surrendered soul in our midst, who shows so much love and compassion for us undeserving souls.\n\nDespite your age and multiple health issues, you stretch yourself beyond imagination just to somehow connect us to Krishna, to give us that experience of prema, to help us understand what it really means to be Krishna conscious. This year's Kartik yatra was yet another demonstration of that.\n\nWe cannot even imagine the life-altering experience that new and even more experienced devotees have when they attend your spellbinding classes, and the super-intense kirtans at the end of them. It is literally like being transported into the spiritual world for those few hours. We genuinely cherished these experiences and are truly grateful for them.\n\nMaharaj, your unlimited spiritual qualities, lectures, kirtans, projects, personal interactions, your whole existence are all wonderful, transcendental offerings of pure love at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada and Sri Sri Radha Gopinath. And we are like the highly undeserving, yet highly fortunate recipients of Their Mahaprasad. Our family has especially been very fortunate to receive your love, blessings and guidance over the last three decades.\n\nOn this most auspicious day of your appearance day, I sincerely pray that Sri Sri Radha Gopinath may bless you with very good health and many more years in Their service. I also pray that we may not be a cause of embarrassment to you, and actually start tangibly contributing to your mission in the right mood of das dasanu das.\n\nYour servants\nSridama sakha das, Priyasakhi devi dasi, Gopika & Mukunda"

My respectful obeisances to all the Vaishnavas.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nMaharaj Ji, on this sacred occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, we express the feelings of our hearts. By your mercy�through your drops of compassion and divine teachings�you have given a new direction to my life. Your words not only impart knowledge but also purify the heart.\n\nYour greatness lies in the fact that you always see a glimpse of God in every living entity. Your simplicity, humility, and compassion teach us that we should perform bhakti with love, sincerity, and purity. From you we learn that we, too, should live in this world with dedication, service, and a pure heart. Seeing your selfless devotion inspires us to serve with sincerity.\n\nHH Bhakti Rasamrita Maharaj shared with us on the occasion of your Vyasa Puja how you have mastered the art of speaking�how your words have influenced countless lives. Even in difficult circumstances, you always speak with humility, gentleness, sensitivity, and calmness. Your words never hurt anyone; they only heal. The sweetness of your speech awakens love and faith in the hearts of all who hear you.\n\nThere is a sweet flavor. Whenever we hear your melodious kirtan, it feels as if the emotions are not just sung�they are pouring directly from your heart.\n\nI would also like to share one memorable experience from my visit to the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj during the last week of January 2025, where I was serving in the Mega Kitchen.\n\nOne morning, after completing seva in the roti-making department, my friend Prabhuji and I went to our tent to rest. After about half an hour, we suddenly heard that you would be visiting the Roti Department in five minutes. We immediately rushed back. At the entrance, your secretary, Pranavananda Prabhu, stopped us, but when we told him that we were serving in that department, he kindly allowed us inside.\n\nWhen we entered, everyone was busy in seva and there was no clear place for us to join. I went near the roti machine where a brahmachari from Vrindavan was removing rotis and applying ghee. I humbly requested him to allow me to apply ghee, but he refused. Just then, you arrived. You looked at that brahmachari, smiled, and expressed gratitude to him. You did not look at me at all.\n\nThe next day, we were again doing seva in the Roti Department. This time, when you came and I was genuinely engaged in service, you looked at me and smiled�your eyebrows softly twinkling. That small gesture taught me a profound lesson:\nNever pretend; always serve with sincerity and dedication.\n\nYours Servant\nSeemadevi Sandeep Singh\nSvarupa Ananda Das"

But only by Your mercy, I got this magical boat. The boat of spirituality, the boat which is filled, full of mercy, in which I get the association of devotees, through which one can attain the spiritual abode, and through which one can attain the goal of life, Krishna Prem.\n\nMaharaj, when I read your *Journey Home*, then by seeing your eagerness to know about spirituality, I am very amazed. Because for gaining knowledge of Bhakti, you do so much struggle, so much hard work for it. And before this, I have never seen or heard about anyone that he is struggling so much for gaining spiritual knowledge. After reading *Journey Home*, my perspective toward Indian culture, spirituality totally changed. After reading the book, I realized that this knowledge I get very easily is not ordinary knowledge; this is the goal of our life, through which we can be able to achieve our goal of life, Krishna Prem. But unfortunately, I am taking it very cheaply. Somehow, I am not able to take this path of Bhakti very seriously. I am doing daily 16 rounds, but while chanting, I am so distracted, not doing with proper intention and attention. Maharaj, please give me mercy so that I will be able to chant very nicely. I will be able to take this path of Krishna Consciousness very seriously and be able to serve in Srila Prabhupada's Mission.\n\nMaharaj, by hearing Srila Prabhupada's lectures, by reading books, I got some knowledge about Bhakti, but somehow, I am lacking in faith. Like, by Krishna's mercy, His some qualities can go into His devotees also. Like everyone is writing offerings to you, and you will know that who wrote this offering; you will read all devotees' offerings without actually (physically) reading it. Now I am writing this offering to you, and you will read this offering, but somehow, while writing also, I have not completely faith that you will read it. So, Maharaj, please bless me so that my faith in Shastras, my faith in my Shiksha Guru, our Guru Parampara will increase more and more.\n\nMaharaj, I like to hear your lectures, especially when devotees ask doubts; when someone asks some questions, then I am very excited to hear your answer to that question because your perspective to see this world, problems, are totally different. You see the whole world with *prem chakshu*. I am very amazed that you are very affectionate towards all living beings without developing any attachment with them.\n\nMaharaj, please give mercy to me, my brother Om, my beloved mother-father, and grandfather. Please bless us so that my mother, father, brother, and grandfather take this process of Krishna Consciousness and start practicing devotional service. Seeing my family chanting Hare Krishna Mahamantra is one of the best days in my life. Your *Journey Home* is very, very nice that I gifted this book to my mother on her birthday, and she also completed this book and liked it very much. Please, Maharaj, bless my beloved mother so that she will also start to practice devotional service with full eagerness and enthusiasm. Also, Maharaj, please bless all my relatives, all my friends, my friends Ajit, Abhijeet, Madhav, Avdhut, Adarsh, Mauli, Suraj, Abhishek, Sujay, and many more friends. By Krishna's mercy, they have very nice good qualities, but somehow they are not taking this process of Krishna consciousness. Please bless them so that they can able to understand the importance of Bhakti and they will eagerly take this process of Bhakti also. Please help me to overcome lusty thoughts which are within my mind. Please help me to clean my heart which is filled with all six types of diseases, and please help me to always remember Krishna and His devotees. As HG Gauranga Prabhuji serves you, HG Radheshyam Prabhuji serves you, and many more devotees serve you, serve in this Mahaprabhu's Mission. I also desire to serve you, desiring to serve in this Mahaprabhu's Mission according to my ability. Please help me, please bless me, and please pray for me to Lord Radha Gopinath.

Your life is a living scripture, teaching us what it means to truly serve with devotion, courage, and compassion.\n\nMaharaj, through your example, you have shown that real spirituality is not found in rituals alone, but in the tenderness of the heart.

You had been cultivating hundreds of youths in tens of universities in America with no help of manpower, finances, vehicle, etc. Being obedient to Srila Prabhupada's representatives, you agreed to move to Chowpatty for services. The university preaching closed down one by one in your absence. You accepted it gratefully and planted that seed of desire in your disciples and empowered them. HG Radheshyam pr recollects that it is your letter on youth preaching, the instructions, and dust of your lotus feet that is the foundation and sustenance (sthapitam yena bhutale). Your inspired HG Rasikanand pr to go to IIT Kharagpur and begin preaching there under the guidance of HG Radheshyam prabhu. I am the recipient of that mercy which brought me to Srila Prabhupada's lotus feet (your Divine residence).\n\n2nd instalment (2008)\n\nI was nurtured by the love, care, training, and education offered by HG Radheshyam pr and the devotees assisting him. A blissful journey of six years with ever-increasing joy. I was about to graduate and move to Pune when we were told that we should go to Srila Prabhupada's birthplace and serve in Kolkata. You gave an historical class on \"Glories of Kolkata\" in 2008 which changed the direction of our life. You desired a revolution in Kolkata and developments at His Divine Grace's birthplace. All of us moved from IIT Kharagpur to Kolkata to embark on fulfilling your desire to serve your Gurudev. Thus, we received our Prabhudatta desha and a lifetime of service.\n\n3rd Instalment (2018-19)\n\nThere was a historical meeting in NOIDA where you spoke with the temple council about developing Srila Prabhupada's historical places and Prabhupada's desire to build a unique and gorgeous temple. Consequently, HG Acaryaratna pr and a set of devotees including me were asked to move to new temple land at Newtown for the development of the project. We had the good fortune of meeting you in Govardhan Eco Village to understand your vision for the project. You personally intervened to settle the issues then and gave us so much confidence to take up the impossible project for Srila Prabhupada. It is the result of your mercy and prayers that we are here at Newtown trying our little to fulfill this dream of yours.\n\n4th instalment (2020-2025)\n\nWe never believed in ourselves to be able to do the project. You encouraged that \"my boys would do it\" and personally showered your love and inspired us for the same. It is literally a metamorphosis from a caterpillar to a butterfly soaring in the sky. Your regular visits, constant support, and inspiration to the well-wishers literally created the metamorphosis. Thus, today we are able to embark on the first phase of the dream temple that Srila Prabhupada envisioned 55 years back in 1970.\n\nThus, it is only by your mercy that I have been able to practice bhakti and become an instrument in the hands of your servants. I owe my life to you, and it is my prayer that I can do something to please you and assist you to serve your Gurudev. The fuel and the internal spirit to keep us going year after year amidst the turbulence of the world is your divine example and your lectures. The annual Kartik yatras are the boosters of our Krishna consciousness. I am very grateful to be your disciple and serve you in the mood of being a servant of your servant. I am constantly experiencing the nectar, warmth, and love from the association that you have inspired.

Especially when I hear your special audio clip on **Submissive Service Attitude.**\n\nThis time I also got the chance to attend the most awaited Karthik Yatra where thousands of devotees were all around, only by your mercy. Many times I was inattentive in your lectures because of my weak devotion and weak heart, and your kirtans after the lecture are so enlivening.\n\nI am very much trying to become more and more devoted to my superiors, but there is always some attachment that remains in the heart while doing anything.\n\nAt this age also, you are very much devotionally charged and inspiring lakhs of people around the globe by your wonderful example.\n\nIn Karthik Yatra, I remember the owner of the land coming to offer you the pheta on your head. Even when you were feeling uncomfortable, still you agreed to let him make you wear it because of your love for him and his service that he rendered. You never think about your convenience but are always willing to do whatever is possible for the welfare of others.\n\nBehind this whole effort and the sole inspiration, you are the main person, but still, you gave all the credit to other devotees with so much love and mercy.\n\nThis quality of sacrificing for others, appreciating others for their every small or big service, inspires me to develop a drop of such quality like you, to make every devotee feel special for each and every service that they render.\n\nIt was your desire that there should be preaching in IITB, and by the mercy of superiors and their guidance, I am trying to do something which I hope is pleasing to you. I don't feel that strong urge to preach, and that's why on this Vyas Puja, I want to pray to you and seek your mercy so that my heart gets filled with compassion for other souls, to preach them this message.\n\nAnd before all this, I really seek your mercy for overcoming my struggles in Bhakti which are becoming obstacles in my path of devotional service.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for inspiring me daily to take this practice seriously, and I want to see myself engaged fully for fulfilling your instructions under the guidance of your representatives.\n\nI hope to be a good disciple of yours.\n\nYour most insignificant servant dhruv"

As you always say that I have given all my instructions in my classes, your classes truly provide all that is needed for a struggling sadhaka to navigate safely through the material world, overcoming innumerable gross and subtle obstacles, and safely reach the shores of the spiritual world and receive eternal loving shelter at Krishna's lotus feet. From your vani, I get enthusiasm and strength to rise above my shortcomings and endeavor to act and live up to your expectations.\nThough I am still struggling to make a regulation of hearing your lectures, whenever I have been able to hear, I feel KC becoming seemingly easy and natural. However, when I have compromised on hearing your vani, I find challenges and obstacles taking shape.\n\nWhatever we hear in your lectures, you are a perfect embodiment of all the principles you teach, be it humility, tolerance, dedication and surrender to spiritual master, complete absorption in Krishna in everything we do, and taste for chanting.\n\nMaharaj, we also get to see the principles you teach in your lectures coming to life in the association you have so carefully created, nurtured, and trained. Recently, in the Kartik Yatra, we got to witness the devotees carrying and applying your instructions to heart and teaching everyone who has come to participate in the yatra through their vivid example. Their service attitude blended with the mood of servant of servant, relentless enthusiasm to do everything possible and impossible to give the best spiritual experience to devotees, cooperating as one body to please you with all their Krishna-given abilities and talents, is truly a memorable and learning experience for all of us to imbibe in our hearts.\n\nMaharaj, we also got to witness a glimpse of your oceanic love for Srila Prabhupada on his disappearance. You had incessant tears of separation all throughout. By seeing how much Srila Prabhupada won your heart and the hearts of millions through his compassion as a pure representative of Lord Nityananda Prabhu, we are able to somewhat fathom the extent of Srila Prabhupada's glory.\n\nMaharaj, despite receiving unlimited good fortune in my life, I have remained stooped in gratifying my mind and senses, very shallow in my depth of Krishna consciousness due to lacking sincerity in following your instructions.\n\nMaharaj, I desperately beg your mercy and blessings so that I may become dedicated and committed in my service to superiors in a way I can please them, become sincere and serious in performing my sadhana, chanting with absorption, hearing your vani and studying Srimad Bhagavatam, develop a humble service attitude in the mood of servant of servant, and glorify devotees despite my conditionings.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nAmar Kishor das"

It is totally out of my capacity to glorify an exalted Vaishnava like you, Maharaj. But only for my purification, I would like to share some thoughts. Your glories are not only limited to India, but they have reached globally. You are certainly a distinguished personality, and you have shown glimpses of this right from your childhood. When you were a child, you were very compassionate toward the poor & needy. You always preferred to sit on the ground for taking meals, just like Indians usually do. That shows there was a deep connection between you & Indian culture. Who could ever imagine that at the age of 19, a person from the Western world would ever think of spirituality & land up in India to fulfill that spiritual thirst I remember the incident from your book, *Journey Home*, that how one official from India obstructed you & how, in response, you told him that one day you would certainly do some good for this country & its people. And the whole world is now witnessing the results. You did what you had promised. That is one of the qualities of a great personality.\nIn Marathi, there is a saying, \"bole taisa tyachi vandaavi paule.\" That means one who acts as he speaks is qualified to be worshipped. You gave us many gifts, like Radha Gopinath Temple, Govardhan Eco Village, Annapurnamrit Project, Bhakti Vedanta Hospital, the counselors' system, etc. Your lectures & books like *Journey Home* & *Journey Within* are inspiring lots of youth & people all over the globe, & they are bestsellers. Every time I hear you, I find you the personification of humility, simplicity & sacrifice. You live the life according to the verses of *Sikshastakam*: \"trinadapi sunichen taror iva sahisnunam.\"\n\nWe are very grateful to you, Maharaj, for the wonderful yatras, through which you give us your association every year. Your Kartik Yatras are ecstatic & your lectures are completely filled with love for Radha Krishna. Thank you very much, Maharaj, for initiating my bhakti and giving me the only shelter of your lotus feet. I'm eternally indebted to you, Dearest Guru Maharaj.\nToday, on this Vyasapuja day, I pray to the Lord & devotees to bless me & my family with the strength to serve you & follow your instructions wholeheartedly with determination in order to please you, Srila Prabhupada & the Guru parampara.\n\nYours insignificant servant,\nDhanurdhar Pran Das, Shraddha, Gaurang"

Whether it is your chanting, giving a class to a few devotees or to 12,000 devotees together, or offering a simple flower or lamp to Their Lordships. In one of your lectures, you mentioned �Bhakti� in one word. You said that �Bhakti� means �Absorption,� and throughout all the various aspects of your life, you show us what absorption really means.\n\nIf we consider the time you spent physically with Srila Prabhupada, it was very little. You had hardly a few interactions with Srila Prabhupada. But somehow, many times you associated with him through vani, books, or perhaps through dreams or some other mediums. Through your words and actions, we get to see how strongly you are connected with Srila Prabhupada and the entire parampara. In your classes, we learn about the deep affection you have for Srila Prabhupada and our acharyas. When we hear your classes, we get some glimpses of that deep affection. The way you narrate the pastimes is truly extraordinary. They have helped me in various aspects of my life.\n\nI still remember during the lockdown, after one of the online classes, we stayed back in the meeting and thought to ask for prayers for our preaching. We did that, and you blessed us. In that batch, we received wonderful devotees at our center. Many of them have become very good leaders now. This year, I am again praying at your lotus feet to bestow your blessings on our tiny preaching endeavors.\n\nIn my life, I have committed many mistakes, but one of the biggest mistakes I feel I have committed is that when there was an initiation interview for the first time, I said �No� to taking initiation, as I was not feeling ready for it.

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Maharaja,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet.\n\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada and all glories to your holiness for everything in my life.\nI have written Vyasa Puja Offerings for Srila Prabhupada only till now, but this is the first time I am writing a Vyasa Puja offering for you, Maharaja.\n\nI am unworthy and not qualified at all to write this, but for my own purification and for Krishna�s pleasure, I will try in this humble attempt.\nIt�s my great good fortune that by the supreme divine grace of Srila Prabhupada and his followers, I came in contact with Krishna Consciousness 4 years ago. I was speedily heading towards a hellish and goal-less society filled with just artificial living and the essence of life based on simply sense enjoyment, either gross or subtle. I had no clue of what life really means; what is the human form of life meant to offer Is life just meant for enjoyment, but that enjoyment is filled with enormous suffering, so what this life has to offer to me Even we don�t realize that enjoyment is packaged with suffering; that is the depth of ignorance under which we are buried. Who is Bhagawan or Krishna and what does he have to give and take in this world What is the essence of all the great scriptures of the world, and what is the essence for which all the saintly persons are living I didn�t even question these basic, constitutional, and foundational things.\n\nBut Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda had amazingly astonishing plans for me. They somehow sent devotees, or by their causeless mercy, I met those devotees who entered inside me like a needle and became like a plough, ploughing and digging and uprooting my deep ignorance from my stoned heart and planting the most beautiful and the ultimate essence of entire creation � Krishna � The Supreme Personality of Godhead. And by the divine unlimited blessings of Srila Prabhupada and all acaryas, I got the best of the spiritual opulence in my life, although I was not qualified at all, and even today, I�m not truly grateful deep inside. I got the association of devotees for which all the great personalities from our scriptures, like Lord Brahma, Narada, and Siva, even aspire. It�s the same date, 15-11-2021 (4 years exactly from today), that I started staying for the first time with devotees. I soon realized how in the world people can be like them. What nectarine words are coming from their mouths, what strong character and values they hold, and how truly they just want to love Krishna and share that love with others and love all the jivas, all the parts and parcels of Krishna. I was just mesmerized by their loving compassion and care.\n\nI got the best of the training, guidance, care, and empowerment staying in our VOICE Centre in Varanasi. I am truly grateful from my heart to you, Maharaja, and following your footsteps, HG Radheshyam Prabhu started this initiative of VOICE. I am eternally grateful to HG Acyuta Mohan Prabhu for creating such wonderful VOICE Centres in Varanasi. I am extremely grateful to HG Apurva Gopal Prabhu who allowed me to stay in that VOICE even though I was most unqualified. I just wish I could again join back those days and absorb myself, which I was not able to do in those days being very inattentive and lazy. I got every best possible spiritual opulence � such genuine, caring devotee friends, loving seniors, amazing Yatras, wonderful opportunities to serve, delicious prasadam, and everyday being a feast starting with dancing in Mangala Aarati.\n\nAnd the most auspicious and fortunate thing I got to receive there was you, Maharaja � the journey of your life, about the communities and projects that you have offered in service to Srila Prabhupada, your heartfelt lectures filled with your love towards Krishna, your soul-enlivening Kirtans, and also your amazing disciples.\nAfter I graduated from VOICE, I could make sense of how fortunate I was being allowed to stay there.\n\nSo, Maharaja, definitely words would fall short in glorifying you for everything that you have graced upon us. Whenever I really feel down in my Bhakti life, I tune to your lecture and immediately I find an answer, and I get the very specific thing that I was looking for. There are thousands and thousands of lectures that you have spoken to train us to love Krishna, to train us how not to fall prey to Maya, to train us how rare Bhakti is, to train us how to truly reciprocate to Srila Prabhupada�s mercy, to train us what a Vaisnava means, to train us how to act or respond to situations in our life, to train us �What does Vaisnava seva means and how that�s the essence of Bhakti,� to train us what humility is. You keep reminding us the Siksastaka verse of Trnadapi Sunicena. You keep hammering over this, as you know humility is the only way to attract the mercy of Krishna and our Acaryas. Your lectures are simple yet filled with profound wisdom, filled with love towards Krishna. Your lectures are the natural outpour of the love that you possess in your heart towards Krishna and Srila Prabhupada. I just pray that may I take full advantage of the ever-accessible Vani Seva - your lectures and someday learn to love and serve Krishna and his dear devotees.\nSrila Prabhupada built a house in which the whole world could live, and you, Maharaja, one of the finest jewels in Srila Prabhupada�s army, have beautifully decorated that house and taught us how to do the same.\n\nYou taught us how Krishna Consciousness can be super exciting, how everyday can be a festival, how truly to take shelter of holy names of Krishna, how we should come together as a team to offer services, how our every activity should be an offering to Krishna and devotees, how to please the devotees and how not to displease or offend the devotees, how to serve cows, how to dance in Kirtans, how to visit holy dhams and get absorbed in the potency of Dham, and simply how to love Krishna.\n\nI am so grateful to have attended 3 Kartik Yatras till now, and these Yatras are deeply nourishing and feeding the hunger of our souls. We hear that there is everything in the scriptures; the Vedas are Kalpa-tarus, desire-fulfilling trees. We see in Chaitanya Charitamrita how the festivals are celebrated in Lord Chaitanya�s lila, how everyone is just happy serving the Lord and devotees, how everyone is dancing ecstatically to please Lord Krishna, and how everyone is relishing the glories of Dhams and the Lord�s unlimited pastimes and pastime places. I can truly see Chaitanya Charitamrita manifesting in your Yatras, Maharaja, where everyone is just willing to serve and please all the devotees.\nThis is what a Person Bhagavatam is who shows by his example what the Book Bhagavatam says, and you are such a rare Person Bhagavatam, Maharaja, who is truly sharing the message of Srila Vyasa Deva in the line of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nReading your \"Journey Home\" book, Maharaj, was such a faith-giving story to me that how fortunate we are to be in the shelter of Srila Prabhupada. One small realization for me was that how much Maharaja faced troubles in his life traveling from America to India, facing so many hardships, with practically having no penny, risking your life countless times, crossing borders after borders, and finally arriving in the land of India. Even in India, you traveled to so many places like the Himalayas, Varanasi, Rishikesh, Delhi, Bodh Gaya, Patna, Mumbai, and even Nepal in search of your spiritual emancipation, and your search ended at the divine lotus feet of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. You have done all the filtering, you have done all the search, you have done all the quality checks, and you have conclusively said from your story that �Srila Prabhupada ki Jaya.� And it�s very important for us and our conditioned minds to understand that Srila Prabhupada has given us everything, and he is the real Jagad Guru. You have done all the hard work to ease out things for us and give us that faith. From your story, one more thing we can see is how Krishna has personally orchestrated and carved your journey. The way you stopped at Mathura on the day of Janmashtami, the way you had to extend your visa and stay in Vrindavan, the way Krishna saved you from all so-called gurus, and the way Krishna paved your way to surrender unto Srila Prabhupada. Sri Sri Gaur Nitai deeply wanted you to be in their army, and they arranged everything for a 19-year-old boy from America to become a premi Bhakta of Sri Sri Radha Gopinatha.\n\nThank you so much again, Maharaj, for everything. I pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath, Lalita Visakha, Sri Sri Gaur Nitai, Sri Gopal Ji � Your Pranadhana � that may they bless you with the best of health. This world needs you, Maharaja, to expand the glories of Sri Sri Gaur Nitai to every town and village. I just pray to you, Maharaj, that please give me a drop of love that you have towards your Guru Maharaja � Srila Prabhupada and Sri Sri Radha Gopinatha. Please bless me that may I become a humble instrument of compassion in the hands of my superiors and Srila Prabhupada. I am currently rendering some services at Varanasi and Prayagraj under the able guidance of HG Acyuta Mohan Prabhu. May I be able to serve HG Acyuta Mohan Prabhu, HG Radheshyam Prabhu, and you, Maharaja, in expanding the causeless mercy of Srila Prabhupada. I am so grateful to be given an opportunity to assist and serve you and all of them who are tirelessly working to decrease the pain of Krishna and our Acaryas by connecting the Jivas who have turned away from Krishna.\n\nI am extremely grateful to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Mandir secretaries for giving all of us this chance to glorify HH Radhanatha Swami Maharaja personally for his decades of unwavering service to Srila Prabhupada and International Society for Krishna Consciousness.\n\nAlso, Maharaja, I pray to you that please accept me, this fallen, lowly servant, as yours. I know that I have no qualification, but by your causeless mercy, I pray that someday you accept me as your disciple. I deeply and sincerely seek your shelter, Maharaja, so that I may fulfill the true purpose of this human form of life.\nThank you, Srila Gurudeva.\n\nHappy 75th appearance day, Maharaja.\n\nHis Holiness Radhanatha Swami Maharaja ki Jaya.\nSrila Prabhupada ki Jaya.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nJayant"

I have seen people with ability, agility, austerity and creativity,\n     You were the first, I met, having all of the above with boundless purity.\n6. You exemplified pure devotional service without any ulterior motive,\n    Even while performing austerities yourself, but to others, you were always sensitive.\n7. Sitting at Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Mandir under the supercool AC and the fan,\n    I am convinced Krsna is the Supreme God and you are my complete diamond man.\n8. You deal right from a municipality sweeper to our prime minister NAMO,\n    To such a magnanimous spiritual master, my heartfelt koti koti pamho.\n9. For serving the deities, you could convince an ox,\n    And for serving kheer to a devotee, you emptied a full dry fruit box.\n10. In this world so obscure, where all the things allure,\n     We look up to you for cure, since you are pure for sure.\n11. In this world of quarrel and hypocrisy, we are always bound by chain,\n     Then we remember all your lectures, which do not end without trinadapi sunichen.\n12. The personal moments spent with you, cannot be erased from my heart,\n      You do it with such a natural flare, for us, it is still a mystical art.\n13. You always preach for simple living, and not falling prey to amenities,\n      Your USP has always been to build happy and spiritually vibrant communities.\n14. Although the personal association with you has to a degree become rare,\n      Still, through service to the Vaishnavas, we know, we are in your heart somewhere.\n15. My insignificant ability to speak is the result of hearing your lively lectures,\n      By listening to your melodious kirtans, even a heart of steel ruptures.\n16. You wish that we always preach, stay together, but away from the forbidden,\n      I am eternally indebted to you, for giving me service in the form of Gopal�s Garden.\n17. I pray that you are bestowed with a long long life and the best of health,\n      Your words, association, projects and disciples are my only cherished wealth.\n18. The world is going through so much turmoil and people have absolutely no clue,\nOnly two people have the solution, leaders like Modi and saints like you.\n19. I pray to you and Krsna to empower me, to make your mission my life and soul,\n      And taking responsibility on your behalf becomes my life's sole goal.\n20. Please, always keep me in your service, although I am lazy, fallen and kaami,\nWishing you the most auspicious, healthy and happy 75th birthday, my dearest His Holiness Radhanath Swami.\n\nThank you very much for all the love that you have bestowed on me and my family.\n\nYour servants,\n\nVeerchandra das (Vinayak Kulkarni)\nRasasthali devi dasi (Sanyogeeta Kulkarni)\nNimaichandra\nVaidehi\nSrividya"

Ever since I connected with this movement, his teachings, books, and devotees have continually guided me.\nWhen I first joined this movement, I would read the books of Shrila Prabhupada for spiritual guidance. However, two books, Shrila Prabhupada�s Lilamrit and Maharaj�s The Journey Home, stirred something deep within me. They inspired me to dedicate more of my time and energy toward my spiritual upliftment through devotional service. The sacrifices they made for the spiritual welfare of people are beyond imagination. I was especially moved by their unwavering dedication to serve their Guru Maharaj. That dedication became a beacon of light for me, encouraging me to continue my little sadhana daily.\nAlso, when I attended my first Yatra in Mayapur, I was touched beyond words during Maharaj�s final lecture. His humility as he personally thanked every devotee and volunteer involved in the entire yatra melted my heart. In that moment, I realized what genuine humility and gratitude truly mean. That gratitude profoundly humbled my own soul.\nWith these few words, I offer my heartfelt prayers for Maharaj�s long and healthy life, and I humbly pray for his blessings to grant me the strength and determination to face all challenges on the path of bhakti, so that I may always remember Krishna and serve His devotees with sincerity and love.\n\nHare Krishna\nHH Radhanath Swami Maharaj ki jaya!\nShrila Prabhupada ki Jaya!\n\nYour aspiring humble servant,\nAshwin Das"

Maharaj, there is so much I want to express�so much love, gratitude, and admiration that I do not even know how to contain it. After reading your Autobiography, The Journey Home, my life, my heart, and my consciousness were deeply touched and transformed. It was the first book of my entire life that made me cry out of love that I never knew my heart could feel.\n\nThere are certain moments from your divine journey that pierced my heart and made me weep:\n\n1. When you were pleading before the Sikh officer to allow you entry into India�your love for India, for Krishna, for saints, and for all living beings radiated from those pages. Your sincerity shook my heart.\n\n2. The moment you first met Srila Prabhupda, and when he lovingly asked you to come on stage and sit beside him. That scene made me feel as though I was witnessing the meeting of a long-lost son with his eternal spiritual father.\n\n3. When you were drowning in Mother Ganga, and in that moment of danger the Hare Krishna Mah-mantra arose once again in your heart�just as Ganga had first revealed it to you. Those words made me cry uncontrollably, Maharaj. They revealed your deep, mystical relationship with the Lord and His holy names.\n\n4. The humility, love, and compassion of Ghanshyam Baba�his devotion to his deities - Gopjana-Vallabha and his affection for you�filled my heart with reverence and tears. Such divine relationships are rarely seen in this world.\n\nMaharaj, after finishing each page of your journey, I felt a flood of love rising within me for you. I never imagined that someday I would adore anyone with such purity, respect, and heartfelt devotion. I feel so fortunate�so blessed�that I had the privilege to read about your life and experience a glimpse of your divine heart.\n\nMy only desire in this lifetime is to somehow, someday, receive your divine shelter. I know I am unworthy, undeserving, and unqualified in every way. Yet I also know that by your causeless mercy, by your blessings, even a fallen soul like me can learn to serve Krishna with love, humility, and sincerity.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for accepting me. You bless every living entity despite their countless shortcomings. I beg you, please bless me too�so that I may become humble, kind, truthful, compassionate, and a good human being, and eventually, by your mercy, a sincere servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the supreme lord.\n\nI love you dearly, Maharaj. I pray that one day I may have your divine daran, and get initiation from you Maharajand that I may express everything in my heart before you personally.\n\nI bow down unto your divine lotus feet, beloved Maharaj.\nPlease accept my humble and sincere obeisances.\n\nHH Radhanath Swami Maharaj Ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\nYour useless, unworthy, and undeserving servant,\nRinki Bhatt\nHare Krishna "

Once, just to please me, when my son was just an infant & we were in the temple hall, & he was lying down & I was sitting near him & chanting, you came & started playing with him for at least 8 to 10 minutes. It was so nice of you to make me satisfied & feel loved. You played with my son. My own parents had disowned me & didn't even come for my marriage or see my son, let alone play with him.\n\nI wasn't someone great, just a simple girl trying to follow your instructions as much as possible. No one ever gave me any sort of importance other than certain devotees like H.G. Adhikeshava pr, H.G. Vishwaroopa pr.\n\nBut you were always kind to me. I miss those moments, those days. I know it's humanly not at all possible for me to again have those moments in life back. My son is so grateful to you how you were kind to his mother when all doors were shut. He says he will be forever grateful to you & will be more than happy to serve you at any time of his life.\n\nThis temple of Radha Gopinath is a living Dham for me. Every time I come, I always meditate that your lotus feet have touched this place so many times & wherever you are in the world, your heart is beating for remembrance of their Lordships.\n\nWhen I get some seva, I try my best to remember you & feel how to please you through this service. After many years, my mom called me home & she was wondering how I survived so well without any support, how well my son is brought up with so many values. Then I showed her your photo & introduced her to you, saying that it's because of you I have survived well under your shelter as you are my Spiritual Master & also have adopted me as your daughter since 2000. So this is all your mercy that now she is trying to chant one round & love Krishna in her own way.\n\nThank you millions & millions of times for giving me shelter, making me feel loved, praying for me, giving me a different world to live in, and much more which I can't mention.\n\nAlways longing for your ever-increasing love & blessings, your most insignificant daughter & disciple,\n\nSukhi Devi Dasi  "

    "Your Offering": "Dearest Gurudev,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nAs I sit to write my Vyasa Puja Offering to you, my mind goes back to the late evening in 2002 when some of us were with you at Udupi at the residence of Dayal Chandra Prabhu, and we had come to your room to see you sitting before your laptop, to see you and your laptop fully covered by thousands of small insects of all types and shapes, and you were typing something fully engrossed. Looking at our enquiring faces, you responded, \"I am finishing my Vyasa Puja offering to Srila Prabhupada, and today is the last day for submission.\" I was thinking, \"Oh my Lord! Maharaja is so much engrossed in his writing of his Vyasa Puja offering to his spiritual master that he is completely oblivious to the thousands of insects literally covering his face and his head, and maybe even biting him.\" I was completely overwhelmed by your absorption, and the same thing I observed during the daily lectures at Govardhan during the Kartik Yatra. Your shawl was literally covered with hundreds of insects, and there must have been much more buzzing around you, but you were completely oblivious to them as you were diving deep into the nectar of the holy names during Kirtan and pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu during your classes. I pray at your lotus feet, Gurudev, please shower me with a drop of this absorption in the holy names and the pastimes of the Lord.\n\nIt was at the same residence of Dayal Chandra Prabhu that one morning when we came to your room, we could see that you had barely slept the whole night, and as soon as we settled into your room, you said, \"Have I come to Udupi to die I was kept awake the whole night because of the dogs barking. This is so very disturbing. Let us go back to Bombay immediately.\" We all panicked, and then we told you that we had alternative accommodation a few kilometers away which you should please try for a couple of days and then decide. Fortunately, that house was much more peaceful, and you settled down to a couple of weeks of rest and peace.\n\nWe are extremely grateful to you, Gurudev, for all that you are giving us: all the love and affection, the devotee association, the ever-increasing bliss of participating in yatras with all the devotees, and of course, the home that you had made for us at Govardhan Eco Village. I was struck by your two words, \"Welcome Home,\" during the opening of Govardhan Kunj, after which you gave us a very elaborate purport and then once again concluded with the words, \"Welcome Home.\" Of course, this was not the first time we had heard these two words. You have repeated to us these two words again and again over the last twelve years since you got involved with the development of Govardhan Eco Village to drive home the point that this is your home, and it is yours for your taking. What a great fortune you have created for us!!!! This project is touching the hearts of each and everyone who comes here and creating lasting memories in their lives.\n\nOnce you made Govardhan Eco Village the oasis that it is to the worldwide congregation of ISKCON devotees, you turned your mind to Radha Gopinath Temple once again, and I remember the conversation that we had on Janmashtami day of 2024 when a few of us were sitting with you in the courtyard. You were relaxed and peaceful, and in a very casual way, you remarked, \"Radha Gopinath temple is the parent of all the temples that have emerged through the efforts of the brahmacaris and congregation (so very naturally, you did not include yourself in this), and how can we have it any less beautiful than any of the other temples The kitchen is so shabby, and it needs to be completely refurbished, and so do Bhaktivedanta Hall and Bhakti Siddhanta Hall. It would be so wonderful if we had stone cladding in building numbers 1 and 2 so that we can have a proper synergy between the temple building and the two buildings by its side.\" You told us how you would like the Laxmi Narayan Courtyard to be renovated, and it was on this day of Janmashtami that you said that the Laxmi Narayan Deities should be named as Sri Sri Radha Paitha Bihari, and with a hearty laugh, gave us the purport with the pastime of Lord Vishnu having his two extra hands disappear due to the love of Shrimati Radharani at Paitha.\n\nWe are seeing so many miracles taking place on the eve of your 75th appearance. Flats in Radha Gopinath Mandir where we have been having court cases going on for years with no end in sight were miraculously getting settled out of court with the tenants themselves coming forward with reasonable requests for settlement, and many, many more which I am not able to spell out here. On this most joyous occasion of the 75th appearance of Your Divine Grace, I pray at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, our parampara, and Sri Radha Gopinathji to give you a long and wonderful life ahead in the service of your loving Spiritual Master, Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, and continue to be a beacon of hope in this miserable material world to thousands of more Vaishnavas to bring them to the lotus feet of Shrimati Radharani.\n\nYour servant,\n\nKrishna Naam das"

I pray that Your guidance may be the sun to constantly guide me through all paths by dispelling away the darkness.\nI really want to practice pure devotional service, because that is the very nature of the soul. Please bless me that I may be able to practice it and become completely purified and be able to bring a beautiful smile on the lotus faces of r Hari, Guru and Vaiavas.\nAspiring for Your causeless divine mercy,\nAmeya Katare"

Thank you so much for your mercy. This year I tried being better than last year. I feel I came a little bit closer to Krishna than last year. All glories to you and Prabhupad. It's all your blessings and mercy.\nYou have always taught to serve, love, and take care of other devotees. I find it really difficult. It's really difficult to please others. No matter how hard I try, I still disappoint someone or the other. I am unable to please you too. I am your most fallen child, undeserving of your causeless mercy, but you have always been so kind and loving and accepting. Thank you for everything Gurumaharaj, thank you so much. Because of your mercy, I was able to come to this year's yatra, and I would also be coming to GEV for the first time on the occasion of the Festival of Gratitude. I always try to be better; I want to be better, but I always fail miserably. It's all your mercy that I am still in Krishna consciousness. I don't know what to write to you, how to express my gratitude, I don't know. I am the most foolish and fallen, but you are so merciful even on a creature like me. I want to serve you Gurumaharaj. Please bless me so that I can serve you nicely, so that I can serve Prabhupad nicely, so that I can take your instructions to my heart and follow them diligently. I am so grateful for your shelter. Please bless me so that I never take it for granted, so that I always remember that even though I don't deserve it, I have still been blessed with the precious gift of Krishna Consciousness. As it was rightly said by one devotee, I would really like to repeat it and I mean it: please take away or snatch away from me whatever minute independence that I have and put me in the shelter of your lotus feet, in your service forever and ever.\n\nThank you so much for everything Gurumaharaj.\nYour most, most fallen daughter"

Such souls are exceedingly rare and difficult to find, and even more difficult to associate with. They are powerhouses of mercy, kindness, and divine qualities.\n\nHow we long to imbibe even a small particle of those qualities � even a small particle of your own divine qualities, dear Gurudev. You walk among us and shower us with all those blessings.\n\nAmong your countless beautiful qualities, there is one that shines especially brightly for us: your unlimited mercy. Your mercy manifests in so many ways and in so many forms � each like a precious and incomparable gift.\n\nOne of your greatest gifts to us is your time � time granted to you by the Lord, which you so mercifully share with us all. You spend your time connecting us, guiding us, uplifting us.\n\nYour long lectures and teachings, infused with love, care, and compassion, give us life, hope, and knowledge � without which our spiritual journey would be unthinkable. Sometimes, just a few minutes of your time are enough to protect a devotee from the danger of going astray. You never hesitate to walk long distances to visit a disciple in the hospital, or to call and speak with someone in the moment they need you most. The sacrifice of your precious time for our enlightenment is the pinnacle of your mercy.\n\nEven today, we still marvel at the causeless mercy you have shown to us. Although your presence in this world is rare, Krishna allowed our paths to cross, so that ordinary, insignificant, and fallen souls like us could receive a chance � a priceless opportunity. On this auspicious day of your anniversary, we pray that you continue to grant us this chance, and that we may never fail to use it properly.\n\nWe pray to hold firmly to your instructions, your love, and your divine lotus feet.\n\nRecently, we heard in one of your lectures that whatever realizations, good qualities, and abilities we possess are not our own; they are lent to us solely for the purpose of helping and serving others. We pray, our beloved Gurudev, that whatever we receive on our spiritual journey may be used wisely, and only for the purpose for which it was intended.\n\nYour servants,\nBhagavata das & Jayanti devi dasi"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nGuru Maharaj, your example and teachings are extremely instrumental in the life of this fallen soul. Just as an expert doctor treats a patient with great care and sensitivity yet removes the disease from the root so that it never returns, similarly, through your deep and compassionate instructions, you reveal the faults and deficiencies within my heart, many of which I am not even aware of, and you fill that space with the nourishing juice of Krishna consciousness.\n\n�om aj�na-timirndhasya j�n�jana-alkay��\nOnly by regularly hearing from you and sincerely trying to apply your teachings in my life, I experience protection from ignorance. But the moment I become negligent, Maya immediately influences me. This is how the spiritual master delivers the disciple from darkness by the torchlight of transcendental knowledge.\n\nThis year has been especially filled with your causeless mercy. During my travel to the U.S. with HG Radheshyam Prabhu, my heart held one desire�to receive your personal association, as in India it is very rare for me. And you fulfilled that desire in the very first meeting at HG Vaisesika Prabhu�s home in San Francisco. There was almost no possibility that I could meet you that day, but by your grace, circumstances led me to your lotus feet.\n\nWhen you received HG Radheshyam Prabhu and lovingly embraced him, I stood quietly behind, simply hoping for your darshan. But out of your boundless compassion, you called me, embraced me, and asked me to sit inside. I sat at your feet and witnessed divine exchanges between you, HG Vaisesika Prabhu, and HG Radheshyam Prabhu, an unforgettable moment engraved in my heart forever. That loving embrace while leaving is still alive within me.\n\nDuring the 20 days in New York, although it is considered Maya�s headquarters, by your presence and your association, it became a holy dham, daily visiting the Bhakti Center, hearing your Krishna-katha and kirtans, visiting 26 2nd Avenue, and witnessing your profound love for Srila Prabhupada. Seeing how you revived 26 2nd Avenue exactly as it was in 1966, and hearing how you worked tirelessly with senior Prabhupada disciples to restore every historical detail, increased my faith immensely.\n\nI remembered how you were also instrumental in restoring Srila Prabhupada�s birthplace, the birthplace of ISKCON (Ultadanga Junction), and now you also brought back the glory of 26 2nd Avenue. Similarly, during the Boston Arrival festival, when you walked with HG Radheshyam Prabhu and spoke about how Srila Prabhupada arrived alone on a cargo ship and now thousands of devotees gather on an opulent cruise, your deep meditation on Srila Prabhupada touched my heart profoundly.\n\nYour overflowing love for Srila Prabhupada, your unity with godbrothers, your care for disciples, incredible historical initiatives, Kartik Yatras, and temple festivals�all reveal your humility and simplicity. Even non-devotees are inspired to appreciate Srila Prabhupada and ISKCON because of your genuine Vaishnava qualities.\n\nI sincerely thank you, Guru Maharaj, for accepting me as your insignificant disciple and giving me the priceless shelter of your lotus feet.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nVaishnav Sharan Das"

    "Your Offering": "Dearest Guru Maharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisance. All glories to Sri Sri Guru and Gauranga.\n\nA few years ago, at the Govardhan EcoVillage, you took me on a walk. If I close my eyes now and meditate on it, I can try to see it�\n\nThere isn�t any agenda or plan; nothing pressing to discuss or work on. You just start walking and motion for me to follow. And so I do. We make our way together, winding up and down pathways and roads, sometimes slowly strolling and other times vigorously walking, occasionally stopping to take something in. We mainly hold a comfortable silence, but sometimes you bring a topic up or tell a story. Sometimes I also nervously ask a question or try to prime you for more, all too aware that this magical experience may come to an end at any moment and wanting to take full advantage of this unexpected gift. But amazingly the walk keeps going.\n\nAfter circling around for a bit, we eventually slip into the interior of the Vrindavan Forest. You seem to be gliding rather than walking now� moving effortlessly from temple to temple, happily flitting between the samadhis and trees and miniature kunds like a hummingbird who knows where every flower is and how to draw out nectar from each one� and you sweep me along with you. You are so clearly at home here, and you seem to be inviting me to make this special place my home, too.\n\nWe finally come to a spot by the Yamuna and you invite me to sit beside you on a rock. That comfortable warm silence rests with us again; since time is completely elastic now, we sit for either a few seconds or something close to an hour. Finally, I break the silence and ask you the questions that are burning in my mind: �Why me What did I do to deserve this mercy How am I so fortunate to have the gift of this time with you� Spontaneously and inelegantly I even sputter out: �This makes no sense.�\n\nYou smile and your response forever transforms my understanding of spiritual life and of the guru-disciple relationship.\n\n�Love doesn�t make sense,� you say, gently but also with conviction, �it doesn�t have to make sense. I love you and I like to spend time with you�.� You go on to speak words that affirm and encourage me, that chip away at the layers of shame and doubt and insecurity that I�ve carried from my childhood and brought with me into my spiritual life. You let me know that I don�t need to be anyone but myself, that you love and accept me as I am, and that you also see my potential and love me as I grow into that potential.\n\nAnd in that instant, as special as I feel, I also simultaneously know that you feel the exact same way about each and every one of your disciples. That you genuinely see it as your special service to Srila Prabhupada to love and guide each of us, and that you are grateful for each and every one of us.\n\nMaharaj, when I met you I was a child. I was lost, hurting, deeply insecure and uncertain�. Looking for my forever family, my forever home, my spiritual father. You became all these for me and more. You�ve watched me grow up, you�ve seen me stumble and embarrass myself, you�ve guided and corrected and chastised me.\n\nBut mainly, you�ve just patiently and unconditionally loved and encouraged me. Without any other agenda or for any other purpose. You�ve kept walking forward on the adventure of Krishna consciousness and kindly motioned for me to follow along. We�ve made our way together, winding up and down the challenges and triumphs. I�ve grown to just appreciate being in your presence, without needing to prove myself or win your attention; I�ve come to love that comfortable silence almost as much I love your storytelling.\n\nI love you everywhere, Maharaj, but I especially have come to love you at home in that magical Vrindavan Forest which you painstakingly created as an offering to your beloved Srila Prabhupada. I love how you glide effortlessly there, the transcendental hummingbird who draws out and shares nectar and reminds us to strive to always seek the nectar and forgive or tolerate everything else.

Srila Prabhupada transported this padmagandha milk from the spiritual to the material world through his writings, teachings, temples, devotees, and preaching. Gurudev, through your lectures and discourses and personal example, you have churned this padmagandha milk into delicious butter in the form of a family of devotees, counsellor system, yatras, Govardhan eco village, and Bhaktivedanta Hospital. Every lecture of yours is like different flavors of this delicious butter that we taste through our ears. The butter you churn through your lectures draws our hearts towards the pastimes of the Supreme Lord and His devotees. In doing so, we get a glimpse of your deep appreciation, commitment, faith, sincerity, and love towards your Spiritual Master Srila Prabhupada and the Guru Parampara while you are distributing this butter to us.\nBy connecting us to the Parampara system, Gurudev you have established a connection that is potent to take us back to the spiritual world and serve the exalted souls in the mood of the servant of the servant of the servant. On the most auspicious occasion of your appearance day, we pray at the dust of lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath to bless you with good health and long life.

    "Your Offering": "Respected Dear Gurudev,\nPlease accept my dandavats pranams.\n\nOne of the rare qualities that I appreciate in you is your ability to slow down. This ability stems from the depth of calmness that you have in your heart and consciousness, which is displayed through your mind, words, and actions. And due to this, you are also present, mindful, and thoughtful in everything you do, every conversation you strike, every thing you see, feel, and touch.\nAnd when I think why and how you can be like that, the only thing that comes to my mind is that you are with Lord Krishna always. You are a lover of Krishna and therefore you never leave Him. And because you never ever leave Him, you naturally get that quality of gravity and depth, which makes your every move, word, and act full of grace.\n\nIn a world where we are all constantly being coerced to be fast, this quality of slowing down is really needed to be 'conscious' and then finally be 'Krishna conscious'.\n\nReal gratitude is shown by one's actions. Although in that sense, I don't have an iota of gratitude, but today I want to take this opportunity to express the same in my empty words.\n\nYou are our friend, father, guide, and well-wisher. Like a flowing river that is ever available to relieve the traveler's fatigue and thirst, you have been always present for all of us. The only limitation is our container and the resistance in approaching you.\n\nI am unlimitedly grateful for the beautiful god family you have given us. There is so much debt that my family has from all the service we have received. When my mother, HG Laadli Radha Mataji, was diagnosed with cancer, the entire GeV community so nicely accommodated her and nourished both of my parents. Srinandanandan Prabhu, Gauranga Prabhu, Vasudev Prabhu, Dr. Sridhar, and so many others took such nice care. They did all the things that I was supposed to do. But, as unfortunate as I am, I missed that opportunity to serve. Now my father is a resident of GeV and has so many devotee friends. And he is very happy staying in GeV.\n\nWe hope someday we all would be able to do some service to GeV that may make you happy.\n\nThis year of 2025, three of the most important father figures in my life turned 75. You, Gurudev, my father HG Shyam Behari Prabhu, and India's Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. It is my sincere and earnest desire to serve you, dear Maharaj, in a way that all the other father figures are satisfied.\n\nI am actually not a good person, Maharaj. I don't have emotional bonding with anyone. Thus, I can be very dry in relationships. But you, Maharaj, are a king in relationships. I am your subject, although unwilling. I beg you to reward me with a fraction of your consciousness so I can have meaningful relationships. What else is Vrindavan about It is all about loving relationships, as you have taught.\n\nThank you very much, Maharaj, for everything. I beg Lord Krishna to remove all duplicity that I have so that I mean whatever I speak and I do whatever I say.\n\nAn unsurrendered soul and aspiring to be a servant of your servants,\nVraja Kishore das"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Dear Gurudev,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances unto your lotus feet.\n\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada, all glories to you.\n\nToday, I am having mixed feelings, both very happy and enthusiastic and at the same time very sad. Happy and enthusiastic to glorify your unlimited qualities, which are an ocean of limitless qualities; even a small drop of such qualities can purify one�s existence in this material world. I am feeling sad that I am unable to imbibe such purifying qualities in my life due to my shortcomings and lack of determination and ignoring small, small details of Bhakti.\n\nIn one of the offerings to Srila Prabhupada, you said:\nSrila Prabhupada said once, �Sometimes a person picks up a stick, then picks up a gourd, a pumpkin, and then picks up a wire and then puts them all together to make an instrument. He said that�s the way how I started this movement. I just picked up you� and you� and you and put you all together and told you to preach & chant the holy name.� Srila Prabhupada, what did he have to work with They were not people from Brahman families; he just took people who were meat-eaters, who were taking so many intoxicants, gambling their lives away, who were confused. But Srila Prabhupada transformed them into wonderful Vaishnavas and within a couple of years, by his example, by his compassion & by his purity, he gave them the power to go out to other countries in other parts of America where Krsna consciousness was absolutely unknown and start centers & all of them were flourishing.\n\nGurudev, in the footsteps of Srila Prabhupada, you also picked many young boys who were IITians, engineers, MBAs, doctors, professionals, stock market professionals, highly educated, and many other classes of people regardless of their caste and creed and gave them Krishna consciousness in such a way that they have surrendered their life for the mission of Srila Prabhupada and dedicated their life in preaching to many countries of the world. We can now see that they have transformed the lives of many people, especially youths, throughout India and many other countries.\n\nI feel very humbled when I hear the struggle you have faced throughout your life, from Richard to H.H. Radhanath Swami Maharaj. There were many occasions in my life when things were not as per my expectations and everything seemed to be very gloomy and doubtful, but every time you have dispelled the darkness by your V. Hearing your lectures cuts out all the doubts and sadness or dryness in devotional life and gives fresh energy or enthusiasm to progress in Bhakti.\nI am very much attracted by your quality of giving respect to others and expecting no respect for oneself, which has touched the hearts of many people of this world in many fields, whether it is businessmen, film artists, musicians, professionals, and other classes of men.\n\nIn one of the lectures of your glorification, I heard that you had specially instructed to keep the Vyas san big, 3-4 seater, not just for a single person. When your godbrothers visit you in Sri Sri Radha Gopinath temple, you tell them to sit next to you, and you first glorify each and every guest devotee who is seated beside you on the Vyas san. This apparently simple thing is very deep and filled with so many instructions and deep lessons which attract the mercy of the assembled Vaishnavas. It is *amnin mna-dena, krtanya sad hari*. This is the reason how you are the personification of *amnin mna-dena, krtanya sad hari*. And when someone asked you why you are not carrying any deity of the Lord with you, you said, �Harinm is my deity; I always carry them with me.� This shows the faith and conviction on the holy name, which you carry all over the world and distribute by your beautiful *kirtans* and lectures and your dealings with other devotees. It is because of this conviction on the holy name that you have attracted thousands of conditioned souls in India and other countries to follow Krishna Consciousness and chant the holy name of the Lord.\nGurudev, I humbly pray at your lotus feet that I can develop such faith and conviction towards the holy name and distribute the holy name to others and can remain a tiny, insignificant servant to my authorities at the local center and do whatever they expect from me without any ulterior motives.\n\nOne more quality of yours is attracting me very much, which is absorption in hearing or chanting the glories of the Lord. Many times, we have heard from other senior disciples that in the initial Yatras when you took 25-50 devotees to Dhm Ytr, you had no schedules fixed before going to the Ytr. You got absorbed in Krishna Kath that there was no time limit. You gave classes for long hours, 5-7 hours of classes in the Ytr, where devotees got lunch at the time of dinner. These were the most enlightening and joyful experiences of most of the devotees present in those Ytrs. I have heard from devotees that the same absorption you have when you visit Goverdhan Eco Village. You relish the beautiful Vrindavan forest, Yamuna, and the six Goswami temples, especially Sri Sri Radha Madan Mohan, which is the most dearest to your heart.\n\nThis reminds me about the beautiful verse of Guruastakam, which we daily sing in morning prayer:\nsri-radhika-madhavayor aparamadhurya-\nlila guna-rupa-namnam\npratikshanasvadana-lolupasya\nvande guroh sri-charanaravindam\nThe spiritual master is always eager to hear and chant about the unlimited conjugal pastimes of Sri Sri Radhika and Madhava, and about Their qualities, names, and forms. The spiritual master aspires to relish these at every moment. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.\n\nGurudev, due to my uncontrolled mind and senses, I am unable to absorb myself in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. My mind is so restless that I cannot fix it in doing one thing at a time. I humbly pray at your lotus feet that a little drop of this quality of yours I can grasp and imbibe in my life, which would give my restless mind and senses a protected shelter of Harinm and the glories of the Lord and His devotees.\n\nToday, on this auspicious occasion of Vyas Puja Celebration, I pray to all assembled Vaishnavas that I can remain a loyal servant of my ik Guru and Dk Guru and discharge my duties wholeheartedly without any adulterated motives.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nCaitanya Kishore Das."

All glories to rla Prabhupda.\n\nOn this most auspicious day of Your 75th Appearance, I feel deeply fortunate and grateful to have received this opportunity to express even a drop of appreciation for Your boundless compassion, love, and care.\n\nDuring the recent Krtik Ytr, I witnessed Your care in a way that touched me profoundly. You envisioned and arranged every detail with such thoughtfulness that every devotee � young, elderly, or physically challenged � felt personally embraced by Your affection. The separate prasdam arrangement for senior devotees, where they could sit peacefully without any anxiety, reflected the compassionate heart with which You lead us. I could see how much ease and dignity it brought to them, and it reminded me that real spirituality expresses itself through practical, heartfelt compassion.\n\nThe care You arranged for the children was equally heart-warming. The dedicated play-area brought them so much joy, allowing them to feel at home in a spiritual environment. It also allowed their parents to hear Your nectarean kath peacefully, without worry.\n\nYour compassion extended even into the realm of health and well-being. The medical seva arranged under Your guidance was a blessing for many of us. I personally experienced its value during my leg injury. The timely attention, the gentle care, and the genuine concern shown by devotees brought me so much relief. I also witnessed devotees with serious health conditions receiving whatever care and treatment they needed from doctor-devotees. That entire arrangement radiated Your spirit � where every devotee�s pain is Your pain, and every devotee�s comfort is Your comfort.\n\nOne of the most wondrous moments of the Ytr was the complete absence of rain, even though it was expected. It felt as though Girirja Himself was sheltering us because of Your divine presence. It allowed all of us to experience the Govardhan pastime in a way that felt divinely orchestrated. Walking under the clear skies, hearing the sweet krtans, and seeing thousands of devotees moving together in harmony felt like a miracle You personally gifted us. It was only because of Your mercy that I could witness the beauty and sweetness of that sacred pastime right there in Govardhan.\n\nThroughout the entire Ytr, You held us together like a loving father � guiding, protecting, and inspiring us at every moment. Your presence softened every hardship and transformed every moment into a spiritual treasure. The way You personally observed every detail made each one of us feel valued, cared for, and deeply sheltered.\n\nMahrj, today I offer something from my heart. I humbly beg for Your blessings to help me remain steady in the vows I took at my initiation on December 27th at Govardhan Eco-Village. Please give me the strength and sincerity to live those vows � not mechanically, but lovingly, with full surrender to Your instructions. May I always remember that initiation was not just a ceremony � it was a lifelong commitment to Your lotus feet, a promise to shape my life according to Your teachings.\n\nPlease bless me so that I may follow Your instructions wholeheartedly, without compromise, without hesitation, and without laziness.\ntd api suncena,\ntaror iva sahiun,\namnin mnadena,\nkrtanya sad hari.\nMay I cultivate humility, tolerance, and respect for all � just as You exemplify every moment. May these qualities become the foundation of my service, my chanting, and my relationships. May I become an instrument in Your mission, serving You with gratitude, sincerity, and devotion.\n\nGuru Mahrj, whatever spiritual progress I have made is only because of Your mercy. Whatever I may become in the future will also be by Your grace alone.

This, like many other incidents of my life, are not actually at all incidents but divine arrangements of Shri Krishna in my life.\nI�ve been a so-called human being, living with all kinds of animalistic propensities and habits not much conducive for Bhakti, and do not deserve to remain in the association of Vaishnavas. My attachment and emotions to my own perceptions of life have always been dragging me to the miseries of life. But by your Divine Grace and instructions, I find a strong purpose and shelter to live for something in life. It's all the power of your divine words, O Gurudeva, by which this two-legged animal is turning into a human. And sheltered by your words, empowered disciples like HG Radheshyam Prabhuji, HG Achyuta Mohan Prabhuji, HG Satya Sankarshan Prabhuji, and Himanshu Prabhuji have been always instrumental for my faith in Krishna, the process of Krishna Consciousness, & Srila Prabhupada. They are continuously opening my eyes filled with illusions of this material world and giving me *shastra cakshu* to comprehend the purpose of this very human form of life. You provided me with the most important of all knowledge, which is to realize my true identity as a spirit soul and re-establish in my natural *svabhava* of loving and serving The Divine Lordships of Sri Sri Radha Krishna.\nI have no qualification to glorify Your unlimited glories and pastimes by my ignorant mind, but taking it as an opportunity for my own purification, I�d love to list a few of them and always keep them at the very core of my heart. I am deeply touched by Your faith and love for Srila Prabhupada, and how sincerely You have taken His teachings and lived Your whole life as an offering to Him. You had just three to four personal interactions with Srila Prabhupada, that too with actions and not words, but have taken the essence of His teachings through Your regular, constant association with Him through His words and serving through His instructions. I remember during very difficult times of the development of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Mandir, You always kept everyone united and sheltered under one tree of Srila Prabhupada�s ISKCON. Your initial life in New Vrindavana and Youth Preaching service there teaches us the meaning of true love, renunciation, and determination all together simultaneously, which is exemplary. As You showed us the real meaning of Bhakti, that is to only give love and love and love to one and all, without expecting anything for oneself but only for the pleasure of one's Spiritual Master.\nSrila Gurumaharaj, You are filled with the topmost realizations of life & Krishna Prema through Your love & surrender for Srila Prabhupada that You always only desire to give Krishna to each and every *jiva* living on this planet. If it so pleases You, please bless me with such simple faith, purity, humility, tolerance, sincerity, seriousness, shelter in Guru Parampara, and Your words, like You do have always in Srila Prabhupada. I seek for strength from You that may I be able to serve nicely locally and to my parent temple and everywhere throughout the world for propagating The movement of Shri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the right spirit of being a humble instrument of compassion in the hands of my superiors. May I be always able to follow Your Divine instructions in my life and live my life in the spirit of being a servant of servant of servant of devotees and make my goal of life just to serve, satisfy, and please Hari, Guru, and Vaishnavas. I desire to serve You more and more through serving Your instructions You�ve given in Your classes and Your faithful disciples, my *shiksha gurus* like HG Radheshyam Prabhuji and HG Achyuta Mohan Prabhuji. I pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Ji and Gaura Nitai that may They give You good health.\nThank you very much,\nYour Insignificant Servant of Servant,\nMadhav Tiwari"

I was wandering in this world of illusion but by some good fortune I came in contact with devotees and came in association of devotees. Your teachings, being the right torchlight, have illuminated my life with proper understanding of myself, the material and spiritual world, about God, and the jiva's relationship with God, which can be awakened by doing bhakti with sincere service to Guru. Actually, it is impossible to fully mention the Guru's qualities, but here are some: your quality of compassion, steadfast devotion, dedication to preaching, and your unwavering dedication to serving the mission of Srila Prabhupada. And even after doing it all over the world, your quality of *trnad api sunicena* is very much inspiring, and I pray to imbibe even a drop of such humility and enthusiasm in my own service in whatever insignificant way I may be able to do. Last but not least, I offer my respectful obeisances to your divine Lotus feet. Some of your sincere servants accepted me, and then because of their accepting me (such a fallen soul), you, without even considering a second thought, just accepted me. So I just pray that I may be always ever grateful to such devotees. Dear Gurudeva, please continue to guide this fallen soul, and I pray to always remain in your eternal shelter.\n\nJay Srila Prabhupada."

    "Your Offering": "Please accept my respectful obeisances.\n\nIn recent times, whenever I hear from the disciples of SP, I am repeatedly struck by one common thread that almost every one of them touches upon. It is something that both surprises me and awakens a deep curiosity in my heart. They speak of a kind of love they experienced with SP, a love so powerful, so personal, so transformative, that surrender seemed to arise in them naturally.\n\nEven after decades of separation, this love remains alive in their words and is visible in their life of dedication. Hearing this, I often wonder: What really is that love How does it empower them to go far beyond the usual limits of time, energy, and even what we consider natural constraints How does it command such devotion that the entire world becomes insignificant in comparison Sometimes I question whether I will ever truly understand it, what to speak of experiencing it directly. Yet, through their testimonies, I have received at least one clear hint: where there is true love, there is total surrender.\n\nWhen I hear how personal SP was with you, how he reciprocated, encouraged, and recognized your sincerity, I feel especially blessed. Your honesty, your humility, your search for truth, and ultimately your offering of your life at his lotus feet, all move my heart deeply. You do not highlight mystic experiences, though you certainly had them. Rather, you highlight sincerity, humility, and selfless dedication. And it is this simplicity, this genuineness, that teaches me more than any miracle.\n\nI know I have so much to correct within myself. But I am grateful for what I have already received, even though I have yet to realize its full value. I pray that I may truly recognize and assimilate the jewels of wisdom you give in your classes, and that I may one day awaken even a drop of the same love and surrender that you have for SP.\n\nI beg for your blessings so that I may become worthy of serving your mission with the required Vaishnava qualities.\n\nYour servant."

Please accept my humble obeisance at Your lotus feet.\n\nOn the occasion of Your appearance day, I want to say something about You, because of whom I will remain indebted to You for thousands of crores of lifetimes.\n\nI want to give many thanks to the devotees of Gopinath who are doing so much service for You. They have dedicated their entire lives to You. I didn't know anything about Bhakti. Today, whatever I am is due to Your mercy, Mahrj.\n\nWhen I hadn't come to Bhakti, and devotees were preaching to me, I saw a photo of You. I was so attracted by Your photo, I didn't know why I was so attracted to You. That photo was from London. Then I started watching Your videos and learning about You. It wasn't with such intensity then, but I had a lot of curiosity to know about You.\n\nMahrj, I don't know how to glorify a guru. Please kindly accept my offering.\n\nWhen I wanted to know about You, I was in my second year, I think 2021.\nThen I shifted to voice. Then I didn't know English at all, but by Your mercy, I can now understand Your words. My counselor, HG Jivdaya Prabhu, has helped a lot in this. When I used to pray a lot, asking for a guru, even knowing You, I couldn't decide who my guru was. Then, on the suggestion of a devotee named Prem Govinda Prabhu from Vrindavan, I wrote many letters to Adi Guru Nityananda Prabhu. I did this for a few months. Then my eagerness kept increasing. Then slowly, I started getting inspiration from You and I saw You for the first time in Ge'me (Goverdhan Eco Village). What was that A radiance like the sun. I consider myself very fortunate that these devotees brought me into this association, otherwise if I had died without seeing, knowing, or meeting Mahrj, this life would have been wasted. The question arose in my mind: what would have happened if I had missed this devotee association, if I hadn't come to Bhakti But it is the mercy of Your disciples who preach with great enthusiasm and spread. Because of them, thousands of youth are coming to Bhakti. For example, HG Radhe Shyam Prabhu, HG Jivdaya Prabhu, and many others. Day by day, they are increasing youth preaching as well as global preaching.\n\nIn the 2023 Festival of Gratitude, Jivdaya Prabhu told me there is a program, and if you feel inspired by Mahrj, come to this program. And then I came. And that day was the most precious day of my life, a new beginning of my life. In that program, I realized so much that You are my Gurumaharaj. I was getting answers to many questions from the Supreme Soul. Many things were coming to my memory from Your lectures about how we should be grateful. So much, I am unable to even express how to put this feeling into words, but You know it, Mahrj.\n\nMahrj, I will assist Your disciples or any devotee very well in whatever service You assign me.\n\nThe community You have built, I realized this when I was at Gopinath Mandir for 7 days. Whenever devotees from Gopinath Mandir come, they leave a distinct impression. You have given such love that is flowing through the devotees to the fallen souls. Mahrj, bless me so that I can dedicate my entire life to Your service, to the mission of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Prabhupad, and can render service.\n\nI found out very late that today is the last day to offer and there are only a few minutes left, so I couldn't write much, but I want to tell you more. I will tell you on that day when this festival happens in December.\n\nYour servant, Vaibhav."

Your words have the ability to transform even the coldest hearts, and that is something we all are craving. It has only been a year and a few months since I began listening to your lectures, but the transformation within is remarkable. Your teachings have opened my eyes to my faults and given me the courage to work upon them. Your enhanced emphasis on the third stanza of Shikshatakam always reminds me of what I am practicing and what should be the mood. Whenever there is a dilemma, I try to recollect what I have heard in your lectures. Even when I fail to live up to your instructions, your words give me strength to begin again, especially in times of misery. For the first time, I took your divine darshan when you visited Prayagraj in Kumbh. Since then, I was craving to get your association again as early as possible, and it happened in Kartik. By the mercy of Srila Prabhupada and Vaishnavas, I could be part of the Kartik Yatra this year. Despite all odds, somehow your compassion allowed me to take your divine association and that of devotees, which is helping me in improving my chanting and hearing.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I try a lot to be in the mood which you always talk about, becoming the servant of the servant of the servant. But many times, false ego, ignorance, and pride take charge, and intensity and sincerity fade away. Only by your mercy and vni is it possible to remain steady in devotional service.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I pray to always remember your instructions, to serve devotees sincerely, and to develop the qualities of humility, gratitude, and compassion. I beg for your blessings to become an instrument of your compassion and to always remain under your loving shelter.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I am very fallen in all aspects, but I have the deepest faith that only your mercy can heal me and encourage me to work upon my shortcomings.\n\nI humbly pray always to remain sheltered unto your lotus feet, Vaishnavas, and Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour insignificant aspiring servant,\nPragya Yadav"

This itself indicates what is my devotional status.\n\nYou have been very merciful to have given permission to stay in Sri Sri Radhagopinath Brahmachari ashram for some years, although when I look back, it's like a miracle as to how I landed up there.\n\nI was just hearing about the qualities of devotees from NOD and sure enough, I don't fit into any.\n\nYou have given me brahmana initiation also, and although I thought I would become more serious, I feel that I am gliding down. Somehow, miraculously, due to some reason, although I can't follow the regulative principles and sadhana properly, I am still in devotee association and am engaged in preaching service and deity worship.\n\nYou are the perfect embodiment of all the Vaishnava qualities you preach. Your every word and deed is so profound and deep. I have not seen a person so compassionate, so caring, extending and loving to whoever comes in contact with you, nay, of their material or spiritual disposition. You are the perfect example of an Uttamadhikari maha bhagavata. Yet, you are so reachable to everyone. I know that you fear that you think you may not be able to serve everyone who connects with you, but I can say, like Krishna's mere glance inspires, so does yours.\n\nYou have ended your Karthik Yatra 2025 final day lecture with the words, \"And be very kind to each other.\"\nThis in itself sums up your whole personality. I am personally very fortunate to have had your association. The first time I approached you for an autograph, waiting outside your residence in Mayapur, I got the answer, \"Another time, please.\"\nBut you have given your association and a place in the ashram, and what did I do I have been a disturbance. I couldn't even be punctual in giving you a seat for chanting, nor to offer Damodar Arati lamp for offering, and not to mention the goof-ups I did in guest service. Yet, you tolerated.\n\nBut I am so shameless that I don't have that quality even in a fraction.\n\nI beg at your holy feet that I at least cease to be a bad example, if not a worthy one.\nLet those words, \"Be very kind to each other,\" and \"How can I serve you\" become the guiding light. You also were mentioning in one lecture to make the chanting of 16 rounds and hearing the topmost priority of our lives and see the magic it does in our lives. I want to desperately experience that magic.\n\nI don't have the mood, the attitude, nor the qualification to get your mercy, yet I hope and eagerly and earnestly pray that somehow this one may render something tangible in perfecting his life and helping those connected.\n\nLet me be freed of the anarthas and get properly engaged in seva. Let all the situations, the troubles, the happy moments, sorrow, everything just bring me closer to your lotus feet.\n\nLet me become a good husband according to your wish, a good son, good brother, and if possible, a good father, and most important of all, a good disciple and a good Vaishnava sevak.\n\nThank you very much for your kindness.\n\nMay you live long, long for many years to come. Let my whole life span come to you. May you remain healthy so that you can deliver so many like this one...\n\nYour example and kindness has transformed my roller-coaster married life into a hopeful grihastha life.\n\nI am very happy and delighted to share that I found shelter in my senior Godbrothers like HG Braja Chandra Pr, HG Balaram Shakti Pr, HG Shubha Vilas Pr, HG Gauranga Pr, HG Shyamananda Pr, HG Premanidhi Pr, HG Jadu Thakur Pr, HG Gauranga Vihari Pr, HG Nimai Chand Pr, and so on, who brought me into Bhakti, nurtured, tolerated, inspired, and continue to inspire me.\nI am also very grateful for my brahmachari and grihastha friends, all the wonderful Vaishnavas you gave me. I cannot possibly mention each one's name. They are all keeping me alive and growing in Bhakti.\n\nThank you very, very much for everything.\n\nMay I become a worthy disciple, and when I come before you, let my guilt be a little less and happiness more, that I served you better than before.\n\nYour unworthy servant\nShyamsundar Ananda das"

While you were walking to deliver the evening lecture in the Pandal, on the way, in the crowd, I took the opportunity and tried to enter in front of him. I fell down for dandavat pranam by observing and taking a chance to put my head on your lotus feet for about 10 seconds when you were talking to other devotees. After standing up, you looked up at me and gave a pleasant smile. I also reciprocated and thanked you. I felt myself very happy, much fulfilled, and satisfied to receive your blessings.\n\nOn further yatras at Jagannath Puri in 2018, Vrindavan in 2019, Jagannath Puri in 2023, and Mayapur in 2024, I closely observed you and offered standing obeisances, Namaskar by folding hands when you were leaving the pandal after lectures.\n\nWhen I visited ISKCON Boston, USA, on 5th September 2025, I met you on 6th September 2025, after morning aarti when you were walking on the road in front of the temple. As soon as you saw me, you came forward happily and embraced me very firmly, smiled, and gave blessings. I told you that I came from ISKCON NVCC, Pune, to offer my dedicated services, seva, at the temple for about 6 months, as I came on a Business visa to the USA. You happily welcomed, said it was good, and blessed me to do better devotional services. I felt very happy. Later, I handed over to you 7 cups of burfi prasadam, which I brought from NVCC, Pune.\n\nMaharaj, you came in my dream 5 times and blessed me.\n\nIn the first dream, on Monday, 18th March 2019 night, you gave diksha, initiation, to all 4 of my family members: myself, wife Sunita, son Prashant (now Pandurang Sharan Das, Brahmachari at NVCC, Pune), and daughter Kritika, and blessed all of us.\n\nIn the second dream, on Wednesday, 23rd November 2022, is your 72nd Vyas Puja celebration at NVCC, Pune. The previous day, Tuesday, 22nd November 2022 night, I had an auspicious dream of myself falling at your lotus feet, head resting on your charanamrita, and you blessing me. I was attending your Bhagavatam Katha program in some yatra along with other devotees, and after the program, a group photo with you and other devotees was taken by the program photographer. I felt myself very lucky and blessed with your pure divine power and Krishna blessing me by making you a means and medium.\n\nIn the third dream, in the year 2023, I was attending your lecture, participating in kirtan, and during this, I came to you to do dandavat pranam, which I did, and you blessed me.\n\nOn the fourth occasion, on Friday, 6th September 2024 night, I had a dream of myself present at ISKCON Chowpatty, Mumbai, and observing you giving initiations, dikshas, to several devotees there. I saw you from a very close distance. I discussed with a few initiated devotees; saffron brahmacharis took delicious feast prasadam there. For reference, currently, the initiation program is going on at ISKCON Chowpatty.\n\nOn the fifth occasion, on Wednesday, 9th April 2025 (Dwadashi) night, early morning at about 3:30 am of Thursday, 10th April 2025, I had a dream of seeing you directly on a dias and attending your Kartik Yatra lecture on Govardhan Leela of Shri Krishna at Vrindavan for about 2 hours, sitting myself in the front row, along with thousands of devotees in the pandal. I could see the actual Govardhan Hill behind the pandal. I was given a task of video recording of the lecture for circulation to all by the yatra committee, which I did. This can be correlated to the forthcoming Kartik Yatra 2025 in October 2025 at Vraj, Govardhan Hill, Vrindavan. I feel happy and blessed by all. I could not attend the physical yatra in October 2025 as I am doing seva at ISKCON Boston, USA, from 5th September 2025 to 10th February 2026, for a period of about 6 months, having come on a Business Visa.\n\nI have been chanting 16 rounds from 2007, reading Bhagavad Gita daily, one chapter, shlokas, translation, completed Srimad Bhagavatam reading, Adi and Madhya Lila of Chaitanya Charitamrita, following regulative principles, attending classes, programs, coordinating Deity backup, and clothes pressing sevas at NVCC. I have donated over 1000 Bhagavad Gitas and over 15 Srimad Bhagavatam sets, and I am seriously aspiring for diksha, initiation, from you. My name was finalized, and I was in the final list for the initiation function held at GEV, Wada, on 27th-28th December 2024, which I missed and am waiting for the next immediate opportunity to become your Das, servant, and offer dedicated services to please you, Prabhupad, Radha, and Krishna.\n\nI appreciate your very sincere, hard-working, painstaking efforts, humble nature, servant of servant attitude, humility, compassion, love, and care to all devotees and jivas, in-depth study and presentation, preaching, spreading Krishna Consciousness throughout the world to please Prabhupad, Lord Radha, Krishna, and devotees.

Honestly, Guru Maharaj, now I fear that if I commit sinful activities or any mundane activity, others may blame my Guru for accepting me as a disciple. Although my propensity for committing offenses has not gone away, still I have solace that if I simply hold your lotus feet, just like a raw fruit ripens simply by holding onto its tree, then I will become a nice servant. Maharaj, day by day when I hear your pastimes at ISKCON Juhu, my heart is lost in your humility standards. Your teachings to serve hot, nice food to all devotees, your unique mosquito net invention at Juhu temple, your first-class toilet construction for devotees at Juhu temple, your dedication to serving Kirtan for the Lord when all alone with a harmonium, your spiritually caring words to devotees even at their deathbed, YOUR MINUTE CARE WHILE PUTTING GARLANDS TO SRILA PRABHUPADA, your love, spiritual care for devotees' kids, your guest-serving attitude at Juhu temple, your manifestation of GEV, which is my dream place to serve forever, your genuineness, honesty, simplicity, humble nature, your utmost care for each and every animal you come across, your compassionate nature by which you accept a sinful lady like me, your transcendental smile which takes most of my pain away, your love for Vrindavan, your love for Krishna as you accepted at Kumbh Mela � all these natures are jewels. All of us can be successful in life if we can even follow a little portion of your nature. Your genuineness, respect for all devotees, especially your godbrothers and godsisters, whatever I have heard from your disciples, it attracts me more towards your lotus feet. Please bless me, Maharaj, to be a genuine servant of Your loved ones. Please forgive all my shortcomings, Maharaj. Lust, greed, etc., are troubling me a lot. Please make me the kind of dedicated servant you like the most.

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble obeisances! All glories to Srila Prabhupada! All glories to Sri Guru and Gauranga!\n\nGurudev, every year this day is the most special for us, and so it is today. You have always been giving us so much for so many years, and you are still continuing to give.\n\nBy your tireless and patient efforts, the temple of Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji has become a shelter for me, like so many others. I started my spiritual journey here. The first time I had the chance to come here was during the Sharad Purnima Festival of 1998, when you and H.H. Giriraj Maharaj had given the class. The altar was so beautifully decorated by sincere devotees for the pleasure of Their Lordships. That was the first time I had the opportunity to see you.\n\nYou have arranged so many yatras over the years. The yatras have evolved so much by your desire to serve the devotees: sumptuous prasadam cooked and served, taking care of Varishta Vaishnavas and also kids, nourishing classes. I have attended many yatras, sometimes because my friends were attending, sometimes out of eagerness to get blessings at the holy places after having heard from you about the places. The effect of the hearing, chanting, and association during the yatra, I am able to perceive now after so many years, and I feel grateful for the opportunity to attend the yatras.\n\nAlso, thank you for the caring Godbrothers and Godsisters whose constant guidance and nudging has pushed me to where I am today. They were always there to help when I was at a crossroads.\n\nMaharaj, you give us so much in your classes. You prepare your classes so meticulously so that anyone can understand. You always stress on trnad api sunicena... and when practiced as you instruct, it works like a magic pill in many trying situations. You teach us to work together and love and respect everyone. You tell us the pastimes of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Krishna with so much detail. If I can appreciate and understand the Lord even to an infinitesimal amount, it is because of those sweet narrations.\nYou always speak on the glories of the holy names and how to take shelter of the holy names. Praying that I can sincerely and with determination follow what you teach us, Maharaj.\n\nI have not had the opportunity to have your personal association. But I have Godsisters who have had your personal guidance and are sincerely serving you. When I am in their midst, when we discuss and meditate on your instructions, then I can feel that you are present there.\n\nGurudev, it is not possible to imagine a life without devotional service. If you had not engaged me in Krishna Consciousness, life would have been full of expectations, envy, comparison, and so many other things to do, completely sunk in the ocean of the material world. But still, in my heart, there is not enough gratitude for this life-saving boat that you have given. Praying that I can develop more and more appreciation for you and Srila Prabhupada and more gratitude so that I can truly commit myself to you under all situations.\n\nAspiring to be servant of your servant,\nPrema Kishori ddasi"

May RadhaGopinathji offer more and more strength to you to reach your compassion and love to each jiva in every corner of this world.\n\nYour presence in this world is the most important treasure for all living jivas. Lord Krishna has sent you in this world only for us, as you are not only the representative of Radharani for all ordinary and fallen souls to feel Her love and compassion, but also the feeling of hope in our lives by your presence in our lives.\n\nMaharaj, by your grace, it is very easy for us to feel the spiritual environment of Goloka in this material world also, where each and everyone is simply living for Krishna. Similarly, here we are all simply feeling alive for your love and pleasure. With this, we have a feeling of love for each other also, even though we all have different races, natures, and even many disparities between us in every aspect of life. But still, all of us have the same love for you, Maharaj. That feeling, especially, we felt when we all came in your association, like in Kartik yatra, where we all felt the most loving shelter with your association, and everyone was selflessly, purely seeking and feeling your loving shelter, like in Goloka, each one feeling for Krishna. Which itself confirms your special appearance as Krishna's arrangement for all of us.\n\nYour loving teachings are like sunlight rays reaching into the darkest forest lives of us. You, by your own examples, teach the three main principles of Lord Chaitanya: NAM RUCHI, VAISHNAVA SEVA, and JIV DAYA. Your total, pure surrender to the Lord's Name with simplicity, sincerity, and humility like grass and tolerance like trees for sadhana, with the only motive for the Lord's pleasure. And for Vaishnava Seva, by your sincere serving of all Vaishnavas, right from your wholeheartedly surrendering to your spiritual masters and loving relationship with not only your Godbrothers but with all Vaishnavas with a \"Das Anu Das\" bhava. And the most important teaching of Jiv Daya, by your teachings on how you are practically living and dealing with all entities of your surroundings, with how to achieve the highest consciousness of mind with a loving relationship with each and everyone in your surroundings, as Krishna is living in each and every heart of jivas.\n\nYours is a clear vision on dealing with each and every situation of life, especially bad situations in our lives that are nothing but opportunities given by Krishna to us. And your most famous quote is \"finding hope in the most hopeless situation,\" which is really a practical solution on how to face all life's miseries while still remaining calm and happy to perform our duties in this world. All your Prabhupada and Acharya's purport teachings, by your own loving practical examples, are like showers of rain in the davagni of this our life.\n\nOffering deep prayers at the Lotus Feet of RadhaGopinathji for your healthy life, and please bless me that I may be able to develop some tinge of taste in Harinam, Vaishnav seva, and Jiv daya like you, Maharaj."

It is because of your causeless mercy and boundless compassion that a fallen conditioned soul like me got this most precious opportunity to take shelter at your lotus feet.\n\nThe amount of austerities you have undertaken over the last 55+ years are beyond my comprehension. With my limited intelligence, I struggle to understand as to how you have undergone immense sacrifices and tapasya in your unalloyed dedication to fulfilling, carrying out, and manifesting Srila Prabhupada�s vision. Your tireless and heartfelt efforts to spread Krsna Consciousness throughout the world, especially in the West, are very inspiring, Maharaj. You are indeed so very dear to Srimati Radharani and Lord Krsna, and you have been sent by Them. Your deep absorption in every activity you perform, along with your love and care for the devotees and for all living beings across all species, are manifestations of the highest and purest devotion you offer to the Supreme Lord.\n\nThank you, Maharaj, for blessing us with thousands and thousands of nectarian Krsna Katha and Gaura Katha. You have poured your heart and soul into these lectures, and every sentence you speak carries such weight and significance because of your exemplary and glorious life of living those principles and your deep realizations of the philosophy. By your personal example, you constantly emphasize the importance of serving Lord Chaitanya�s movement in the humble mood of the servant of the servant of the servant. With such deep humility and unflinching determination, you have not only gloriously led the movement but you have also created and empowered leaders who in turn continue to create and empower other leaders. We are truly fortunate and grateful to have the association and guidance of your dear disciples such as HG Gauranga Prabhu, HG Radheshyam Prabhu, HG Vraja Bihari Prabhu, HG Chaitanya Charan Prabhu, and HG Gauranga Darshan Prabhu, to name a few.\n\nOn this auspicious day, I beg at your lotus feet to please forgive me for the offenses I may have committed through my thoughts, words, or actions, and to please grant me strength and intelligence so that I may not commit such offenses in the future. I sincerely pray that I can remember, imbibe, and live the instructions you have given to us. I beg at your lotus feet for your blessings to make progress in the path of Krsna consciousness. I pray that I can maintain and increase the eagerness to attentively chant the holy names. I pray that I can serve some tiny purpose in your mission by engaging in the service of the Vaishnavas in the humble mood of a servant of a servant of a servant. Your prayers and blessings are the lifeline of my spiritual journey.\n\nI pray to The Lordships to bestow and shower Their choicest blessings upon you and grant you very good health.\n\nAspiring to be your worthy disciple,\nYour insignificant servant,\nKrishna Murali Das (Seattle)."

First of all through CBD Belapur Iskcon, Mumbai, and later, within six months, I used to run with one mataji for Iskcon Chowpatty temple. I used to finish up my work fast; honestly speaking, I used to make false excuses to my office and go to Iskcon Chowpatty for attending Mangal Aarti. My student's mother and I both used to plan together, and we used to travel approximately 160 km and adjust with foreigner devotee matajis if a room was not available in a nearby hotel from Chowpatty Iskcon temple. And we used to attend Mangal Aarti; the divine vibes made me visit this temple again and again. The first time I heard about HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj was from the same mataji, my student's mother, Medha Mataji. And one day, from the Iskcon gift corner, one book attracted me specially, its name \"The Journey Home,\" Autobiography of an American Sadhu. I purchased the book. Once after that, when I was reading that book during traveling, one senior citizen wanted to see that book; he read a few pages and kept reading. Seeing his so much interest, I asked him to keep that copy with him. Again, I purchased one more same book. My brother, who is a voracious reader, took that book from me, and he said that he finished the book in two days. He started feeling vairagya. But said as he is grihasth, he cannot give up his family; he became a devotee visiting Iskcon temple. All the time, in his mouth remains Hare Krishna, and by the mercy of Krishna and Maharaj, he has been initiated. Just reading Maharaj's book, his autobiography, made my brother a devotee. This is the divine power of Maharaj. Same, I gifted one more book to one more devotee of Iskcon.\n\nAnd the impact on me is I started reading Shrila Prabhupad's books more, engaged myself more in book distribution. Gifting Maharaj's book to my friends and relatives, which impacted their lives. Maharaj is full of love and divinity. When Maharaj speaks, I feel as if love is flowing from him; it is coming to me. Maharaj is so compassionate like a mother. He always asks to forgive others and be humble. These things converted me; I have learned to forgive from Maharaj. My life has changed because of Maharaj. Maharaj's aura is full of radiance of compassion, love, and divinity. Simply by remembering him, we can feel purity, full of love. On Vyas Puja day, I offer prayers to Shri Shri Radhakunjbihari to bless him with a long, healthy life so that the darkness of crores of people gets enlightened by Maharaj.\n\nOnce again, koti koti dandwat pranam to Maharaj's lotus feet."

I am really grateful and thank you so much for enlivening Kartik Yatra, year after year. This year's Sri Govardhan Dham yatra was really enriching for my dried spiritual life. I could meet many devotees and recollected lost memories from the past. I was very inspired to know that there was no special diet prasad cooking for you, Maharaj; You had the same prasad which all devotees were taking, so that you could personally know the quality and taste of the prasad. The special pastime in the morning when you asked in which direction is Sri Govardhan ji, and by mistake one devotee pointed in the wrong direction, then after some time, You got up and sat in the right direction facing Sri Govardhan ji. And two times you spoke about kala jamun, and I was fearful that you might say something for those who had not eaten, but you heard my prayer and did not speak anything further. I was very much tensed, but you managed and tackled me. Your heartfelt and extreme gratitude towards devotees serving in the kitchen and especially to the hundreds of matajis who are cooking chapatis for all devotees. Your heartfelt appreciation for your Godbrothers and Godsisters is really inspiring. The Vrajavasis who gave land for the yatra pandal and who helped in all yatra arrangements. Keep me in your shelter and the shelter of your servant of your servants. I am planning to assist in US preaching, so please give me strength, shelter, and encouragement for this new project.

Though I am only your aspiring disciple, with an unsteady heart and limited qualification, I am endlessly nourished by your teachings, your humility, and your compassion. You are the very embodiment of strict sdhana and pure Vaiava-sadcra. Just remembering you inspires purification and devotion.\n\n---\n\nYour Mercy Reaching Me Through Your Exalted Disciples\n\nMy journey into Krishna consciousness began in Kartik 2020. I was working in Singapore during the Covid lockdown when Krishna, out of His mercy, slowed down my life and allowed me to turn inward. This pause became the turning point of my spiritual life.\n\nMy first connection with you, Gurudeva, came through your glorious disciple H.G. Gauranga Prabhuji. I happened to hear one of his lectures online and from that day, I would listen to him daily, constantly. His words gave me faith, strength, and direction.\n\nDuring that time, I lost my job, my health weakened, and I became socially isolated. But what I gained was priceless�\nthe awakening of Krishna consciousness and the desire to chant the Holy Names.\nI began with one round during Kartik and by December 2020, I started chanting sixteen rounds daily. This was nothing but your causeless mercy flowing through your disciples.\n\nWhen I returned to India, my spiritual nourishment continued through another brilliant disciple of yours, H.G. Radheshyam Prabhuji. To this day, hardly a single day passes without hearing his classes.\n\nMy mentors H.G. Mukundanand Prabhuji and Parameshwari Mataji lovingly guided me through rla Prabhupda�s books throughout 2021 and beyond.\nAnother priceless blessing is the association of H.G. Anandvrindavan Prabhuji, whose japa sessions on Zoom have transformed my chanting and my consciousness.\n\nEven now, thousands of miles away in Colac, Australia, I continue to receive your shelter through your disciples H.G. Nitynanda Priya Prabhu and H.G. Vasudha Priya Mataji, who tirelessly preach with humility and dedication. Their association constantly reminds me of your mood and mission.\n\nGurudeva, though I am far away, your mercy reaches me every day.\n\n---\n\nA Sacred Pastime: The Darana That Stays in My Heart Forever\n\nIn early 2022, I stayed in Govardhan Ecovillage for my 500-hour yoga course. The thought of receiving my certificate from your hands filled me with eagerness, but because of Covid restrictions and your health, you were not meeting anyone.\n\nOne day, at a distance across the Yamun in GEV, I saw you absorbed in chanting. That vision alone felt like a treasure.\n\nOn my last day in GEV, my heart was heavy. I had been seeing Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Bihari every day, attending Magala rati daily, and now I had to leave. While visiting Sri Radha Govindadev temple to offer gratitude, my mother suddenly said, �Look, Maharaj is here!�\n\nThere you were�\njust a few steps away,\nwith no one else around.\n\nMy mother and I quickly offered our obeisances.\nYou looked at us with humility, with a gentle smile, and folded hands.\nIt was only a few seconds, but it felt like eternity.\nI felt unworthy and too small to approach, but my heart was overflowing with joy. I knew it was Krishna�s reciprocation.\n\nThat moment is engraved forever in my heart.\n\n---\n\nMy Struggle as an Aspiring Disciple\n\nAfter marriage, I moved to Australia. Here I feel physically distant and unable to take initiation from you, and this sometimes causes deep pain within my heart.\nI feel helpless.\nI feel small.\nI feel unqualified�yet I long to serve you, Gurudeva.\n\nI beg for your mercy.\nI beg for your guidance.\nI beg for the strength to become qualified to serve you as your aspiring disciple, and one day, by your grace alone, to become worthy of your shelter.\n\n---\n\nMy Prayer at Your Lotus Feet\n\nOn this auspicious Vysa-pj day, I offer one sincere prayer:\n\nPlease bless me so that I may develop genuine humility, sincere chanting, steady sdhana, and the desire to serve devotees wholeheartedly.\nPlease help me overcome my weaknesses and become a servant of your mission, wherever I am.\nThough I am far, please keep me close to your lotus feet.\n\nThank you, Gurudeva, for every drop of mercy I receive through you and through your exemplary disciples. Whatever little Krishna consciousness I have is entirely your gift.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nVarsha"

    "Your Offering": "Dear Guru Maharaj,\n\nYour 75th appearance is a very joyous occasion. King Rahugana was instructed by Jada Bharata that the opportunity to perform devotional service cannot be attained unless one is blessed by the dust of the feet of great devotees. I see no reason other than your divine grace, bestowing on me the blessings coming through our dear Srila Prabhupada and our Acaryas, that is responsible for me having the opportunity to glorify you. Thank you.\n\nThis year is also my 50th birth anniversary, a very fearful event. More than half of this has been in the association of devotees, and I have been contemplating on whether I have progressed at all, and what the nature of that progression is.\n\nIn your sermons, you often times quote that Krishna is saragrahi; He sees the intent. It is only recently that I am able to understand the gravity of this. If He was only interested in the results of my service, or His grace would flow only to those that are uniquely capable and adept at doing certain services, then my situation would have been completely helpless.\n\nAnd over the years, it is your lectures and personal example through which you have been molding that intent in my heart. In spite of being adamant on being attached to my opinions and my ideas, you have molded the intent in my heart to serve the divine couple. Every class I listen to is almost as if personally meant for me, to help me understand my shortcomings, of which there are many, and to make adjustments in my intent.\n\nAnd when I fail to attentively listen to you, then I have seen that the opportunities to serve have dwindled, either by lack of personal motivation, or by the distaste to chant, or by being resentful of devotees and their association. But you have never given up. In fact, through the means of your disciples or by circumstances, you have brought me back to listening to you and realigning my intent.\n\nThus, your instructions have become the very source of my survival in Krishna Consciousness. You give the intelligence and the opportunity through which I can still be around devotees. As you mention, Srila Prabhupada once mentioned that we should not be surprised that devotees leave; be surprised that they stay. My staying, Gurumaharaj, is just by your grace.\n\nSo, my progress I think is that I have much more faith, and dare I say, complete, unconditional faith in your Grace, that you will never leave me. Wherever I am, you will come to guide me to surrender to the loving service of the Lord and His devotees.\n\nFor that, as you have documented in your book, you have faced deathly diseases, violent, vicious attacks, family heartbreaks, personal abuse, scarcity, and so many insurmountable difficulties. For me! And you continue to do so. Year after year, you continue to provide the grace of the sweet, nectarian words carrying the full potency of the essence of all Vedic knowledge, sweetened by the realizations of our Parampara, uncontaminated in its essence, which nourishes me.\n\nPlease accept these very insignificant services that you inspire. Your Kalachandji's Campus programs are now giving prasadam to hundreds of students daily and providing good revenue to the temple, and allowing pathways to enter into several campuses in North America. Through the Conscious Meals for All program, inspired by Food for Life, more than 30,000 meals are being served annually through Dallas. Recently, the Eco Farm community project has embarked to protect cows and create sustainable communities. The Atma Bhakti Center is slowly progressing and creating educational programs for several. Your Rasika Rani is trying to embark on a medical career, and she has also started a dance school. She is inspired by your Bhaktivedanta Hospital and wants to create a career around integrative medicine.\n\nThank you, Gurumaharaj, for giving me entry into this sweet world of unlimited ecstatic service. I pray to remain engaged in a humble and insignificant way, with the right intent, in your service to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour very insignificant servant,\nRasaraja das"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna Maharaj!\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nMaharaj, once again this year, I offer my Vyasa Puja homage with deep gratitude and anticipation. The days I cherish most throughout the whole year are those 6�7 days of the Kartik Yatra�hearing your kaths, relishing your kirtans, and receiving even a moment of your association. Those moments nourish my heart long after they have passed.\n\nThis year, however, has been spiritually challenging for me. My PhD responsibilities increased significantly, and my sdhana weakened. I could not preach or serve as much as I desired, and at times I felt distant from the devotional standards I aspire to uphold. Yet through these struggles, I realized more deeply what Srila Prabhupada has always emphasized: the material world inevitably humbles us and reminds us of our dependence on shelter. In many ways, I feel Krishna is purifying me for the future, even though the process has been exhausting.\n\nBy your blessings, a beautiful and hopeful direction has entered my life. I am preparing to enter the ghastha rama, and Krishna has arranged a very suitable life partner for me. I am deeply grateful for this mercy and pray that I may live in married life according to your expectations�with purity, devotion, cooperation, and a desire to serve together. I hope that our home becomes an instrument in your mission and Srila Prabhupada�s movement.\n\nAs I approach the completion of my PhD next year, I am uncertain of my next steps academically or professionally. Many directions appear, but clarity is yet to come. What I desire most is the company of devotees and service that pleases you. So I pray that whatever Krishna, Srila Prabhupada, and you have planned for me, I may accept it with gratitude, steadiness, and enthusiasm. Please bless me to remain strong in faith and to serve sincerely in whatever situation I am placed.\n\nThis year is especially significant as it marks your 75th Vyasa Puja. Hearing about your 55 years of unwavering service to Srila Prabhupada�s mission has filled my heart with gratitude and reverence. By the blessings of devotees, I heard so many of your glories�your compassion, your tireless efforts, your dedication to uplift all souls, and your incredible work in making Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Mandir a spiritual home for the whole world. Your emphasis on service, ravaam, humility, gratitude, and Vaishnava relationships continues to shape my life deeply.\n\nMaharaj, although I am not yet initiated by you, I continue to wait with hope and faith�knowing that everything depends on mercy. Like Mukunda�s determination to wait for the Lord�s call even for millions of lifetimes, I also pray to remain patient, sincere, and enthusiastic. Whenever you feel I am ready, I pray that I may someday receive your shelter. Until then, I will keep striving to become qualified and remain grateful for whatever mercy you bestow.\n\nIf there is one blessing I beg from you, Maharaj, it is this: please allow me to always remain grateful.\nGrateful for Krishna�s mercy, grateful for the devotees� kindness, grateful for your guidance, and grateful for whatever Krishna arranges�whether pleasant or challenging. Your emphasis on gratitude has transformed my understanding of spiritual life, and I pray that this quality becomes the foundation of my journey.\n\nMaharaj, thank you for everything�your teachings, compassion, example, and your tireless efforts to manifest Srila Prabhupada�s vision. I pray that in the coming year, I can deepen my devotion, serve with sincerity, and live in a way that brings pleasure to your lotus feet.\n\nYour aspiring servant,\nAman Swaraj"

    "Your Offering": "My most worshipable Sri Guru Maharaj,\n\nPlease accept my humble and respectful obeisances unto your lotus feet.\nAll glories to our beloved Srila Prabhupada and our Guru Maharaj.\n\nI am sincerely very grateful for your unlimited mercy and compassion. Almost 7 years ago, by your causeless mercy, I got the shelter of your blessed lotus feet. I am extremely fortunate to get this opportunity to present my Vyas Puja offerings on this blessed moment of the 75th appearance day of my Sri Guru Maharaj.\n\nAlthough all your words, lectures, and instructions are transcendental gems in my spiritual life, I would like to list a few (75) instructions and teachings which are the guiding principles for all of us:\n\n\t1. Being loyal and faithful is the foundation of a disciple�s character.\n\t2. Humility softens the heart and captures God�s heart.\n\t3. A spiritual approach to life that is based on humility and service transforms even unknown servants to glorious recipients of Lord�s love and mercy.\n\t4. When you are proud, you are already fallen; the rest is just details.\n\t5. Take seriously the responsibilities given by your guru/Parampara � that is the basis of bhakti.\n\t6. Accept that you are insignificant compared to the all-great Lord and His servants � this builds humility.\n\t7. In giving respect, we can be very happy; expecting respect brings misery.\n\t8. Collective unity is better than individual purity.\n\t9. Real faith is awakened from within � not imposed externally.\n\t10. If we judge devotees, it is our spiritual destruction.\n\t11. Every word we speak or everything we do is either an offering to Krishna or our ego.\n\t12. The disciple that pleases the guru is the one who can be depended upon: in all the situations and circumstances, he will be there.\n\t13. Don�t take any service whimsically. If you are asked to change a life-boat, that changing is your path back to Godhead.\n\t14. Serve with gratitude and enthusiasm � service is your connection to Krishna.\n\t15. Even in the discharge of one�s most ordinary daily activities, one must do it very consciously and very carefully, and one must put one�s heart into it.\n\t16. The real blessings of the spiritual master come when we become dependable, when he can trust.\n\t17. Volunteer for higher service only after fulfilling the given responsibility.\n\t18. For spiritual advancement, whatever little service you are given, you have to take that as your life and soul, and you have to be responsible.\n\t19. The acceptance of your responsibility is the basis of bhakti.\n\t20. Don�t be lazy about the given service.\n\t21. What pleases a guru: when a disciple knows, no matter what happens, I will be there.\n\t22. Follow the instructions of your guru-parampara, not the whims of your mind.\n\t23. A true disciple aligns his mind, senses, family, and society to do the service assigned.\n\t24. The behavior of a disciple can be an ornament for or a scar on the reputation of the spiritual master.\n\t25. Service to the guru�s mission is not about ego or recognition; it is about being an instrument.\n\t26. When there is disunity amongst devotees, there cannot be proper Sankirtan.\n\t27. We have the responsibility to chant every day, the prescribed number of rounds.\n\t28. We have the responsibility to follow the four regulative principles.\n\t29. We need to be cooperative and put ourselves second, to create unity amongst the Vaishnavas.\n\t30. The spiritual master may delegate service via his assistants; if you are dependable, you become dear to him, even if the master does not directly instruct you.\n\t31. Don�t let a breath escape from your body without Krishna�s name. That should be our determination throughout our life.\n\t32. The heart seems to have just a few wishes, as the surface of a sea seems to have just a few fishes, but if you see the deep inside, it gives a mesmerizing view.\n\t33. Chant attentively; it�s not just the number but the quality of rounds.\n\t34. Whether advanced or a beginner in Krishna Consciousness, we should not be neglectful even for a second. That one second could mean our spiritual life. It could even mean our material life.\n\t35. Spirituality is based on development of character and philosophy.\n\t36. Mercy means to get what we do not deserve.\n\t37. Great souls are merciful. Srila Prabhupada was pleased with the little things that someone did, even if that person had all bad qualities.\n\t38. All glories to Guru Maharaj means nothing left for us, no credit for us.\n\t39. Krishna consciousness is not achieved but awarded.\n\t40. Ultimately everything will perish except our relationship with Krishna. Whatever we invest in that relationship is eternal.\n\t41. Bhakti means the science of being defeated. Krishna wants to be defeated by the love of His devotee, and the devotee wants to be defeated by Krishna�s love.\n\t42. Bliss in Krishna Consciousness comes only when there is an eagerness to hear Krishna Katha.\n\t43. Krishna is present fully in His Holy Name, and this is realized by humility and sincerity in our chanting.\n\t44. Millions of people will come if you simply present Krishna as He is!\n\t45. We are insignificant; our sins are also insignificant, which Krishna can easily vanquish.\n\t46. A Vaishnava forgives the offender before the offense is over.\n\t47. In giving respect, we can be very happy because we can do it in all situations.\n\t48. When we expect respect, we are miserable because it is not that everyone in every situation will respect us.\n\t49. If you compromise your integrity for the thrills of this world, you will suffer in the future.\n\t50. Love is not enjoyment. Love is being enjoyed!\n\t51. To love is to serve, and to serve is to please.\n\t52. When you surrender, that�s where you get your strength from.\n\t53. By allowing past karma to affect us, Krishna is giving us a chance to surrender more.\n\t54. Surrender sounds horrible to one who wants to be a controller. But it is the sweetest and most pleasing of all words for a devotee who has a humble heart.\n\t55. Without humility, you can have knowledge but not realization.\n\t56. If you accept you are a fool, you can learn. If you don�t feel like a fool, then you are really a fool. :)\n\t57. At our level, genuine humility is to aspire for genuine humility.\n\t58. If you have no determination, you are useless on the spiritual path.\n\t59. To discriminate between the right and the wrong and to be determined to do the right is called determination.\n\t60. Krishna consciousness becomes boring if you are not determined.\n\t61. Gratitude doesn�t mean simply saying thank you. Real gratitude means reciprocation, even if it means great sacrifice.\n\t62. If you read every word of Srila Prabhupada�s purports with a sense of urgency, believe me, these words will change your life.\n\t63. Leadership is not a post to enjoy. Leadership is a very serious, significant responsibility of service to others.\n\t64. Before we commit offenses to devotees, the stage comes in which we feel ourselves better than other devotees.\n\t65. Offenses take away your service. The worst is that it takes away our propensity to serve.\n\t66. Finding faults is sense gratification.\n\t67. A person who finds faults in others is a person full of faults.\n\t68. If a person is criticizing a Vaishnava, then that is the sign that Krishna has withdrawn His mercy, and that is the means by which Krishna withdraws His mercy.\n\t69. The manifestation of ignorance is material desires. To be proud of our righteousness is also a sin.\n\t70. When you advance in Krishna Consciousness, it is more difficult to tolerate being honored than to tolerate being dishonored.\n\t71. The happiness of the material world also disturbs us because it makes us forget Krishna.\n\t72. For a non-devotee, Maya convinces not to surrender unto Krishna. But for a devotee, she convinces to postpone the surrender.\n\t73. The only way we can make this world a better place is to transcend it.\n\t74. Real meaning of austerity - \"trinad api sunicena, taror api sahishnuna, amanina manadena, kirtaniya sada hari\"\n\t75. Sincerely live your spiritual life with integrity by becoming the humble servants of the servants of the servants of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nSri Guru Maharaj ki Jai !!! Srila Prabhupada ki Jai !!\n\nDear Sri Guru Maharaj, thanks for giving me such a wonderful and compassionate God family. With all humility and surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Narsimhadev Bhagawan and Sri Sri Radha Gopinath ji, I sincerely pray for your good health and many more years of your physical association and guidance to all your disciple children. I humbly and sincerely pray that whatever I plan and wish to do gets strongly aligned to your instructions and Srila Prabhupada's satisfaction, ultimately making me an instrument in your hand for the pleasure of Sri Sri Gaura Nitai and their devotees.\n\nPlease kindly keep showering your causeless mercy on all of us so that one day we all can eventually go back to the Godhead by following your divine instructions.\n\nHare Krishna !!\n\nYour humble and unqualified servant,\nShyam Kumar das"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna, dear Maharaj. Please accept my most humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to your divine service.\n\nOn the auspicious occasion of your divine appearance day, I am trying to offer a few words from my insignificant heart.\n\nFor me, you are truly one of the great pioneers of Srila Prabhupada�s Hare Krishna movement in this world. Through your tireless efforts, compassion, and unwavering faith, you have carried Srila Prabhupada�s message to countless hearts. I feel immensely grateful and fortunate to accept you as my ik-guru and to look up to you as my guardian and guide in spiritual life.\n\nAfter my beloved spiritual master, His Holiness Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj, departed from this world last year, I was feeling completely lost and orphaned. But just before leaving, Gurudev instructed us to take shelter of a senior Vaiava in our movement. Following that instruction, the only person my heart naturally turned towards was Your Holiness. Somehow, by your causeless mercy, I have always felt a deep connection with you for many years through your lectures and Hari-kath, and that connection has only grown stronger since Gurudev�s departure.\n\nBy Srila Prabhupada�s and Guru Maharaj�s mercy, I had the great fortune of receiving your daran twice�once last year and once again at the beginning of this year. You were so merciful, Maharaj: you not only gave your daran but also spoke a few kind words to me. In those moments, I strongly felt in my heart that my Guru Maharaj wanted me to take shelter of you, his dear Godbrother. I feel very, very blessed to be somehow associated with Your Holiness.\n\nI am endlessly grateful that we have an unlimited treasure of your lectures, kirtans, and recordings available to us. Because of this, I can daily increase my ravaam and hear Hari-kath from you, even without being in your physical presence. Your V gives me strength and guidance at every step and allows me to feel your association wherever I am.\n\nMaharaj, you have completely transformed my heart and vision. Earlier, although I was practicing Krishna consciousness externally, internally I was in darkness. I was very judgmental and critical, always searching for faults in devotees and proudly thinking that I alone was following the standards properly. But by observing your profound humility, your genuine respect for every devotee, and your deep compassion, over time I began to realize how wrong I was.\n\nI especially remember one pastime narrated by HG Gaurang Prabhu: when some brahmacrs came to you and complained about their fellow brahmacrs not practicing properly, you did not encourage their fault-finding mentality. Instead, you began to speak about the good qualities of those devotees. You taught them to see the positive side of others, to take what is good, and to learn from that, rather than criticizing and trying to bring others down.\n\nThrough such examples, you are teaching all of us how to truly live the mood of td api suncena and amnin mnadena. If there is anyone in this movement from whom I wish to learn real humility, genuine respect for others, and the art of not finding faults in devotees, it is you, rla Radhanath Swami Maharaj. For this, I am forever indebted and grateful to you, Gurudev.\n\nFrom the core of my heart, I offer my repeated thanks to you, dear Maharaj. I address you as Guru Maharaj because, in terms of tattva, guru is one, and I feel such deep connection, guidance, and shelter coming from you. I feel that my Guru Maharaj, His Holiness Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaj, continues to live in his V and also through you�his dear most Godbrother who always had so much love, honor, and respect for him. When I see you, I am reminded of him, and I feel that in serving your instructions, I am also serving his desire.\n\nOn this sacred day of your appearance, I offer my heartfelt prayers at the lotus feet of\nr r Rdh-ymasundar,\nr r Krishna-Balarm,\nr r Gaura-Niti,\nLord Nsihadeva,\nand at the lotus feet of rla Prabhupda,\nthat They kindly keep you healthy, strong, and protected, so that we may have your association and guidance for many more years to come. Your presence in this world is a great hope for fallen souls like me.\n\nI also humbly pray at your lotus feet, Maharaj, that you kindly bestow your mercy upon my younger sister and accept her as your disciple. The only aim of my life is that she may find complete shelter at your lotus feet and be delivered by your causeless mercy. If you accept her, I will consider my life successful.\n\n \n    \n\n�May I be forever devoted to the lotus feet of r Rdhntha Svm, the dear disciple of rla Prabhupda, and may his holy pduks, which follow those lotus feet, dwell in my heart.�\n\nThank you so much, dear Maharaj, for everything. I remain always,\nYour eternally grateful and insignificant servant,\n\nKurma Anadi Das\nISKCON Jalandhar\n(Hopefully aspiring to serve at your lotus feet)"

As it says in SB�\n\nB 3.5.3 (kripa of sadhu for fallen soul uplift)\n-\n: \n \n    \nTranslation:- O my Lord, great philanthropic souls travel on the earth on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to show compassion to the fallen souls who are averse to the sense of subordination to the Lord.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj ji, as you mentioned in your Class that by serving Vaishnavas, Sadhus, we get mercy - Krishna Prem.\nDear Guru Maharaj ji, please pray for me that I should do humble service at your Lotus Feet to please You and Srila Prabhupada as their servant of servant of servant of the servant. As says in SB praman, by serving the Spiritual Master in�\n\nB 3.7.19 (Serving Spiritual Master gives Love for Lord Madhu)\n: : \n: :   \nTranslation:- By serving the feet of the spiritual master, one is enabled to develop transcendental ecstasy in the service of the Personality of Godhead, who is the unchangeable enemy of the Madhu demon and whose service vanquishes one�s material distresses.\n\nMy only hope is You...

No amount of gratitude can cover the causeless mercy you showered upon me. I have been surrounded by calamities, and most of them have been created by my own mind and senses. I have never been so tormented, so much so that it drowns me in the ocean of repentance, thinking that even after being the most fortunate, I am still acting in the most pitiable condition. These conditionings and lusty propensities have blocked my consciousness and accessibility to serve with determined purpose. But time and again, I am being forcefully saved by your vani and devotee association. However, the agitating fire of anarthas is burning me from inside, for which your smile is the solace. With the passing of time, I seek to realize your eternal shelter through your words and messages you have presented in the form of your true devotion for Srila Prabhupada and Krsna.\n\nEvery now and then, I pray for your good health and strength to propagate the real essence of human life throughout the world. It is your mercy that I am able to comprehend the intricacies of this world despite constantly struggling with it. I beg for your mercy on this ignorant soul so that I can at least learn to deal with those intricacies and beat the hellish mind out of the pool of sheer ignorance.\n\nYour Servant of the Servants,\nKrsna Abhishek Das"

May this meager offering find favor in Your eyes, Srila Prabhupada and Their Lordships. \n\nIt all started with �don�t think it is another year, another yatra�. For a person like me, I couldn�t comprehend this at the first, second, or the hundredth time, and it was alarming in my mind continuously throughout the yatra after every few minutes, even after coming back. \n\nAnd then one fine day it made me realize how much compassion and humility I had been lacking, when I recalled the yatra days. Something that became clearer through certain moments that unfolded along the way. And this phrase didn�t unfold here; it unfolded more when I realized the lessons I�ve learned from last year�s yatra. \n\nEach yatra teaches me more than I can ever put into words. \n\nI am profoundly, endlessly grateful to have witnessed that kirtan, when you asked us to raise our voices ten million times louder and offer it back to Krsna. \nThat sacred moment, that precious time, will remain forever in my heart. In it, I was completely lifted into another world. \n\nEven now, I find it hard to believe it, whenever I reflect on how Your divine, merciful Maha Maha found someone as unworthy and undeserving as me. \nAll that has found me has come solely through the causeless mercy of the devotees, whose compassion and love is far greater than anything I could ever hope to merit.\nEven today, it feels like a sacred dream, one before which my heart can only bow, learning slowly to receive it with complete surrender and trembling gratitude. \n\nAnd as You say, because of the whirl of Maya, \nthis is so true; I generally take the great things to be ordinary and ordinary things as great. Please bless me that I should not be trapped into this. \n\nGuru Maharaj,\nPlease bless me that I may articulate my etiquette well, deepen my Sadhana, follow Srila Prabhupada�s instructions. Please bless me to become a servant. Please bless me I should be conscious enough. Please bless me that I may refrain from speaking of mundane matters and utilize more and more time in hearing and chanting the glories of Their Lordships. \n\nPlease bless me that I must not keep any priority before Krsna, and Krsna remains the prime priority over any other priorities. \n\nPlease bless me that I shall be more determined to be a servant of the servant. \n\nI bow in gratitude for Your infinite mercy and love towards me, a mere fool. \nPlease allow me to abide eternally in Your protection and in the shelter of Your devotees. \n\nYour aspiring servant,\nAkriti"

Your words are so deep, meaningful and full of content that it fills the vacuum of my heart. Though because of my insincerity I have not given quality time to hear exclusively but I am hearing while taking bath or while doing my daily chores. I pray that I become sincere to give exclusive time to hear your Vani.\nThis year Kartik Yatra was very nourishing. You gave us wonderful parikrama of Govardhan through the medium of sound vibration with so many esoteric pastimes that I had never heard. Every day evening Katha was so nourishing that I made it a point to hear them again.\nThrough your wonderful lectures as well as your intense prayerful kirtans I felt you are training us to come to higher levels of Krishna consciousness where the intensity and the consciousness is very high.\nI felt through this whole Kartik Yatra you are training us to become residents of the spiritual world where there are innumerable devotees together joyfully serving Sri Sri Radha Krishna. There was a similar mood in the yatra and you have created that mood. In this Kartik Yatra, like every year, you appreciated everyone � the cooks, labourers, the chapati-making matajis, devotees who made annakut offerings, devotees who did various other services, and at the end, all yatra participants.\nI regularly relish the service of proofreading the Bengali *Journey Home* book that I had received 10 years back. I have started again reading *The Journey Home* to absorb the wonderful realizations and experiences that you have shared.\nI am an unworthy disciple of yours, struggling with my mind and senses. Thus I pray for strength to continue with determination in my spiritual life.\nYour aspiring servant,\nAravinda Gopal Das"

When I came to Radhagopinath, I was mesmerized by the beauty of devotees' love and care, and after attending a couple of Sunday feasts, one of my friends told me the very first story about you � how you take care of each one of us. It was the initial days of the yatra, and you took devotees to Vrindavan for the yatra. Everyone wanted to visit the hill where you used to live, and you knew the path was thorny, so you told everyone to stay behind, and you went ahead and cleared all the thorns with your foot so that everyone could walk comfortably. And no one knew until Vishakha Mataji saw your bleeding feet, and you told her not to mention it to anyone. When I heard this story for the first time, I was in shock. How can anyone be so selfless And also, I understand where all the love and care of devotees are coming from. How all the energy comes from the sun to the earth, similarly, you are the source of all the love and selflessness in the devotees. Gurudev, we are really very grateful for everything you have done for us. Even though I am not qualified, I still pray that one day I can be a reason for your smile.

I remember when you came, so much crowd gathered to take your blessings, and I followed you to the stage. During the class, one of the brahmacharis from ISKCON Kolkata was translating your class into Bengali, and a few times he spoke a little long. After a few times, you stopped and told him that you are the translator, not the editor, in a hilarious way, and after the class ended, you embraced him to exchange love. That was a very beautiful moment. And while you were leaving, one of my senior devotees held the elevator, and you blessed him by touching his forehead, and after you left, we rubbed his forehead and took the blessings from his forehead. By your blessings, I could attend Karttik yatra for 2 years. This year also I got the opportunity to attend Karttik yatra by your mercy, and that was tremendous. You always established Srila Prabhupada through your lectures, and I am also trying to follow the principles of Srila Prabhupada. I remember this year, on Srila Prabhupada's Disappearance day, you sang the \"Je Anilo Prem Dhana\" bhajan, and through your voice, it felt like your separation from Prabhupada, and I also noticed there were tears in Prabhupada's deity's eyes during your kirtan. I completed \"The Journey Home\" one week before this Karttik yatra, and that inspired me so much. I knew you are so humble and full of humility, but after completing \"The Journey Home,\" I realized it is next to impossible to be that much humble and tolerant. How much you tolerate, I can't even imagine if I had to face one percent of that much difficulty on the devotional path. It's your blessings that I surrender unto your lotus feet, and please let me stay here forever. I took a commitment that I will hear at least one of your lectures every day and one Chaitanya Charitamrita lecture every day, but I failed to follow. And I know you know this very well that I can't follow your instructions, but still, you are giving me shelter unto your lotus feet, and I am trying to follow the principles of Srila Prabhupada. For that, I can't even express how grateful I am to you, Maharaj.\n\nPlease bless me, Guru Maharaj, so that I can become a humble servant of the servant of the servant. May my false ego, pride, lust, and every attachment in this material world break into pieces and go away. May I be able to serve Prabhupada and you in every possible way. May I follow your instructions properly. Please, Maharaj, forgive me for whatever mistakes I have committed knowingly or unknowingly.\n\nTrying to be a humble servant of the servant,\nTushar"

It is the protection of consciousness � protecting the disciple from my, illusion, and helping him stay fixed in bhakti and remembrance of Krishna.\n\nLet�s look at how this protection operates:\n\n(a) Protection through Instruction � J�na-rakaa\nThe Guru gives divya-j�na, transcendental knowledge, which destroys ignorance.\nJust as a lamp protects one from darkness, knowledge from the Guru protects one from illusion.\n\nSrimad Bhgavatam 11.22.10\nj�na vij�na-sahita yad guhyatama mama\ntad veditu bhavn arhati raddhvn anasyaka\nBy giving j�na and vij�na, the Guru protects the disciple�s buddhi from being stolen by my.\n\nGurumaharaj�s example:\nHe protects his disciples by constantly reminding them of Krishna-centered consciousness, through scriptural classes, personal instructions, and his own life of humility and service. His teachings always center around �Remember Krishna, serve others, and stay under the shelter of the holy name.�\nThat remembrance itself is protection.\n\nGurumaharaj often explains that the Guru protects us by reminding us of who we really are.\n�The world tries to make us forget.\nMaya whispers, �You are the controller, you are the enjoyer.�\nBut the Guru whispers Krishna�s name into our heart.�\nThis whisper of divine remembrance � this abda-brahma � is the Guru�s shield of protection. It�s not the kind of protection that removes every storm; it�s the kind that gives us shelter within the storm.\n\nHe says,\n�When the storm comes, don�t pray for the storm to stop � pray for the strength to hold on to Krishna�s lotus feet.�\nThe Guru gives us that strength.\n\n(b) Protection through Prayer � Kp-rakaa\nA pure devotee prays for his disciples constantly.\nThe Guru�s heart is linked to Krishna�s heart; he begs Krishna to protect those who have taken shelter of him.\n\nSrimad Bhgavatam 10.2.31\nye 'nye 'ravindka vimukta-mnina ... patanty adho 'ndta-yumad-aghraya\nEven a learned person can fall down without shelter of the Lord�s lotus feet.\nThe Guru ensures the disciple always remains under those feet through his prayers and mercy.\n\nGurumaharaj�s Example:\nHe often says, �I pray for you all every day.�\nThis prayer is not sentiment � it�s spiritual intercession. Just as a father prays for his children, the Guru holds the disciple in his heart and connects them to Krishna through his compassion.\n\nGurumaharaj sometimes describes how the Guru feels toward his disciples:\n�The Guru prays for his disciples even when they forget to pray for themselves.\nHe stands before Krishna like a mother before a doctor � begging, �Please save my child.��\n\nThis is *kp-rakaa* � protection through compassion.\nThe Guru may be far away physically, but his prayers travel faster than thought.\nA sincere disciple is never alone.\n\nSrimad Bhgavatam (11.17.27) says:\ncrya m vijnyn nvamanyeta karhicit...\n�Know the crya to be My very self.�\n\nGurumaharaj explains,\n�It means Krishna is personally guiding us through the Guru�s words, through his example, and sometimes through his silence.�\n\n(c) Protection through Example � cra-rakaa\nThe crya protects by living the teachings.\nSeeing the Guru�s example strengthens the disciple�s faith and determination.\n\nBhagavad Gt 3.21\nyad yad carati rehas tat tad evetaro jana\n�Whatever great men do, common men follow.�\n\nGurumaharaj�s Example:\nHis humility, forgiveness, simplicity, and deep compassion inspire devotees to face challenges without losing faith. His life itself becomes a shield � reminding disciples that bhakti is not theoretical; it�s lived sincerity.\n\nIn Gurumaharaj�s life, we see that his teaching and living are one.\nHe sleeps little, eats simply, travels tirelessly � just to help souls reconnect to Krishna.\n\nOnce he said:\n�If my life can help even one person remember Krishna, then my life is successful.�\nThat example is protection � because it shows us what bhakti looks like when it is lived with love.\nBy seeing how the Guru faces pain with gratitude, we learn how to face our own challenges with faith.\nBy seeing how he forgives, we learn what forgiveness means.\nBy seeing how he serves, we learn what real happiness is.\n\nThis is cra-rakaa � protection through example.\n\n(d) Protection through Disciplic Connection � Parampar-rakaa\nThe Guru gives protection by connecting the disciple to the parampar � to Krishna�s unbroken current of mercy.\nWhen we are connected to this current, my cannot touch us.\n\nBhagavad Gt 4.2\neva parampar-prptam ima rjarayo vidu\nThe chain of disciplic succession protects the purity of knowledge and the consciousness of those within it.\n\nSrila Prabhupada says:\n�A disciple connected to the bona fide Guru is connected directly to Krishna.�\nThus, following Guru�s instructions keeps one under Krishna�s direct protection.\nThe Guru�s real protection is not just emotional shelter � it�s spiritual connection.\n\nIn Bhagavad Gt (18.66), Krishna promises:\nsarva-dharmn parityajya mm eka araa vraja\naha tv sarva-ppebhyo mokayiymi m uca\n\nGurumaharaj explains,\n�The Guru�s greatest gift is to bring us to that verse � to help us take shelter of Krishna without fear. When we surrender to Krishna through the Guru�s instructions, Krishna personally takes the responsibility to protect us.�\nSo, when a disciple sincerely follows the Guru�s instructions, Krishna Himself guards that devotee�s heart.\n\nThat is the perfection of Guru�s protection.\n\n(e) Protection through Chastisement � sana-rakaa\nSometimes, the Guru protects by correcting or chastising the disciple � not out of anger, but mercy.\n\nBhgavatam 4.8.34\nguru skt hari ity ukta ... kintu prabhor ya priya eva tasya\nThe Guru is as good as God, but his chastisement or correction is a form of divine love.\nIf the disciple accepts such correction, he becomes purified and protected from downfall.\n\nGurumaharaj once said,\n�When a Guru points out our faults, it is not to make us feel small � it is to help us become who we truly are: servants of Krishna.�\nLike a doctor, he identifies the disease of ego and prescribes the medicine of humility.\nThat correction, though uncomfortable, is an act of deep protection.\nBecause without it, we might wander away from the path of bhakti.\n\n(f) The Guru Protects through the Family of Devotees\nGurumaharaj often emphasizes that the Guru�s protection also manifests through the devotee community.\n�We protect one another when we live in the spirit of service.\nKrishna�s love flows most beautifully through relationships.�\nSo when disciples cooperate, forgive, and care for each other, they are living under the Guru�s protection.\n\nHe says,\n�When you water the root of the tree, every leaf and branch is nourished.\nWhen you serve the mission of your Guru, you are nourished spiritually.�\n\n3. The Heart of the Guru � Gurumaharaj�s Mood\nGurumaharaj embodies the protective compassion of the Guru in several ways:\nHe nurtures the hearts of disciples with affection and patience.\nHe teaches balance � to be strong in sdhana but gentle with others.\nHe inspires service � by teaching that serving devotees and humanity is real protection of the soul.\nHe creates community � spiritual family as an extension of his protection.\n\nHe often quotes:\n�When we take shelter of Krishna and the devotees, Krishna protects us more than a mother protects her child in the womb.�\n\nEssence\nThe Guru-tattva is the manifestation of Krishna�s heart of mercy.\nThrough his words, actions, prayers, and presence, the Guru protects the disciple�s faith, bhakti, and connection with Krishna.\n\nAs Srila Prabhupada said:\n�The spiritual master is the external manifestation of the Supersoul, and he protects the disciple from falling again into the ocean of birth and death.�\n\nIn Gurumaharaj�s words:\n�A real Guru doesn�t claim to be God � he connects you to God.\nHe doesn�t make you dependent on him � he teaches you to depend on Krishna.\nAnd he doesn�t remove the storms � he teaches you how to dance in the rain of Krishna�s mercy.�\n\nSo I am very grateful to Gurumaharaj for giving this protection to us. As a disciple, I cannot repay the debt of Gurumaharaj, but would like to pray that if He feels happy, He can engage me in some service so that I can continue to serve Him.\nYour eternal servant,\nVraja krishna das"

It was indeed a very rare and most treasured moment of my life to have the opportunity to associate with and hear katha along with thousands of devotees.\n\nI also felt very fortunate to attend the Bhagavatam class at Radha Gopinath Temple just before the Kartik Yatra, wherein you mentioned, \"Sometimes we take for granted the opportunities we get. But the fact is that there is danger at every step. Challenges beyond our control can come at any time.

Gurumaharaj, You are very, very dear to my heart. It's your 75th Vyasa puja and it is very, very auspicious for me.\nAs a fallen soul, I am so insignificant to glorify Your divine qualities. But for my love and purification, I want to offer something at your Lotus feet.\nGurumaharaj, initially, I had no connection with you, but it was the mercy of Srila Prabhupada that he connected me with you. Oneday, I had seen your picture on Instagram. It was the picture in which you were dancing in kirtan. When I saw this picture, suddenly I felt the presence of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. And yet, I have kept that feeling in my heart. That day, I was lost in your deep emotion for Hari naam. After sometime, I started listening to your lectures and listening to kirtan also. And day by day, I felt I am becoming addicted to this. Even I cannot sleep without listening to your kirtan. Your Kirtan is more tasty than ice cream.\nThe most divine quality which attracts me so much is your compassion to everyone. Actually, I have learned true kind love from You. You always say we can love everyone when we are detached from this material world. Your love, compassion, humbleness, integrity are unbeatable, unbearable. How can I glorify you, my Gurumaharaj My words have no power to glorify you.\n\nGurumaharaj, yet I have never seen you physically, but I never feel your absence anymore. I always feel your presence by your lectures. Your lectures are like nectar to my ears, which always transform and relish my soul. But I have the urge to see you one day with my eyes. That day my life will be successful. But I don't know when this good fortune will arise for me\nOnce, in a lecture, one devotee asked you who is your favorite deity And you said with full of devotion and love, \"Harinaam.\" When I listened to it from you, I could feel your pure love and deep connection with Krishna's name. And also, oneday, one another devotee asked you what is your favorite sweet You stopped for sometime and said, \"Chanting of Hare Krsna Mahamantra.\" Your love for Krishna is incredible. As a pure soul, you know everything.\nEvery morning, I start my day by seeing your picture on my wallpaper. It gives me more energy and more courage to do my spiritual practice.\nI don't have much personal experience, but I want to share one experience � it was the day of arrival of HH Indradyumna Swami Gurumaharaj to Remuna Iskcon. I was there for the association of Gurumaharaj. There was a lecture of HH Indradyumna Swami Gurumaharaj in the evening. I was alone here, meaning my friend had gone and left me alone for her some works. I have a little bit of social anxiety. When I am alone and see many strangers around me, I feel very awkward. On that time, my body vibrated automatically. So, I prayed to the Lord Gopinath and started listening to your lecture and making notes. Slowly, slowly, I felt my fear fading away. After sometime, I felt much better. That day, I realized the power of your association. Maybe it's physical or not, you are always with me. And also, I felt if there is your Gurudev with you, then you are the most powerful person in this world. You can do anything.\nMy dear Gurumaharaj, your dedication to Srila Prabhupada is incredible. Now you are living your life for Srila Prabhupada.\nNow I am reading your books, \"The Journey Home.\" This book is such a great inspiration for the conditioned soul like me. Your sacrifice, your unmotivated and uninterrupted devotion for Krsna is just stunning.\nI am so much inspired by your simplicity and compassion for everyone. You never see any difference among any soul. You are always ready to give your mercy to a fallen soul.\n\nOoo, my Gurudev, You are a true representative of Gauranga Mahaprabhu and you are the real \"Prabhupad's Man.\" Lord Gopinath always bless you. Always keep you at His shelter.\nYou know everything about me. I am the most fallen soul in this world. I always need your mercy for upliftment. I don't know if you will accept me as your disciple or not. Even I have not such qualification. But Gurumaharaj, always keep me as a dust particle at your Lotus feet and allow me to serve you for the rest of my life uninterruptedly. Please accept me as your daughter. And\n\"Let me live as Your servant. Die as Your servant. And awaken only as your servant of servant of servant.\"\n\nYours most insignificant Daughter,\nSarojini."

I owe you everything - from the seed of bhakti that was planted by your disciples and followers, to the training and encouragement they've all given me. You have created such a wonderful family of vaishnavas worldwide. They say it takes a whole village to grow a young boy into a man. The same is true with growing in Krishna Consciousness. The community of vaishnavas created by you helps us at each step. I am grateful to you for your example of purity, deep humility, devotion, and determination - which act like a pole star for thousands like me to take inspiration from. Guru Maharaj, this year you also gave shelter to my sister, and the only way I can understand this is that it is your causeless mercy and compassion. This compassion of yours is our only hope Gurudeva!\n\nI know that I lack in so many aspects in my practice of devotional service. I try to assist you in your mission, and serve the vaishnavas based on my limited capacity. Although my services and sadhana are full of faults, yet, everyday when I pray to you while chanting, offering bhoga, etc, I've faith that you still accept my faulty services. This is not because of what I do, but because of who you are - unlimitedly kind and compassionate. Guru Maharaj, I have witnessed the power of your instructions. I followed some of them, and saw miraculous results. I can only imagine how much I will advance, and can serve your mission, if I can follow all your instructions properly. Guru Maharaj, I beg for your mercy - please bestow upon me the spiritual strength to be able to follow yours and Prabhupada's instructions properly. I beg to you for mercy that I always remain a humble servant of vaishnavas, improve in my sadhana, and be able to effectively reach out to other souls who are in need of Krishna Consciousness.\n\nAspiring to be the servant of your servants,\nShyam Dulal Das"

All glories to Your Grace!\nTo celebrate the special day of Your Vysa-pj 2025, I write to You with a heart full of gratitude for Your teachings and for the divine light You brought into my life.\n\nBefore meeting You, eager but devoid of an authentic spiritual direction, I was thirsty for truth, freedom, love, but I didn't know where to find pure water to quench that thirst. I still remember the first time I met Your Grace and received Your merciful darana: at that moment I understood that I had finally found the Guru that I had been deeply seeking for so long. Tears of joy streamed down my face as I felt Your compassion embracing my soul.\nIt was as if the boulders of daily worries melted instantly, and I experienced a pure joy that I had never felt before. This is because I felt that You could bring me back on the right path, the path of Bhakti.\nThanks to You, I don't walk a lonely path in the desert, but I was officially welcomed this year (on 10/02) in ISKCON, a great international spiritual family, in which I can find support and friendship from all the devotees. The moment of the recent first initiation will remain forever imprinted in my heart; I was for an instant in the spiritual world, exactly when my ears heard my spiritual name for the first time, and I felt alive, new, and my feet seemed to no longer touch the floor of the Temple.\n\nYour adventurous life is a powerful example for me and inspires me every time I encounter obstacles on my spiritual path: it reminds me that, with faith and determination, by the grace of Guru and Krishna, I too will be able to overcome any adversity.\nYou travel tirelessly to bring Krishna consciousness around the world, following the example of HDG Srila Prabhupada, our crya Founder and Your teacher.\nEven if we are physically very far away, I feel You close every day through the priceless treasure of Your teachings that echo in my heart and continue to illuminate my path like a constant lighthouse, a spiritual compass capable of guiding every decision, big or small.\n\nI also want to express my deepest gratitude because You taught me to live in sobriety and truth, to cultivate relationships based on compassion and selfless love, to practice ahims.\nThrough words and actions, You are an example of Mercy, Tolerance, Humility, Compassion and Purity.\nThe virtues I mentioned guide my steps and remind me of the ideal of divine love to which I aspire.\n\nI try, in my small way, to develop at least a spark of Your luminous Bhakti in my life, so that I can serve You better in spreading Your teachings and, one day, becoming a disciple of whom You can be satisfied.\nThere are not enough words to express my gratitude for all this.\n\nI promise You that I will continue to strive to apply Your teachings in my life and to share them with others, thus hoping to repay at least partially the immense debt of love I have towards You.\n\nOn this sacred day dedicated to You, I humbly offer this letter to Your lotus feet, as a small sign of my love and devotion, praying that I can always remain under Your protection and brilliant spiritual guidance.\n\nYour grateful and devoted servant,\nVinod M�jar Dev Ds"

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nMaharaj, everything you have so mercifully bestowed upon us is truly nourishing. Your blessings upon our entire family�in the form of Sri Sri Radha Govardhandhari at the Govardhan Eco-Village, the most glorious welcoming of Sri Sri Radha Giridhari at our residence earlier this year through your blessings, your visit to the IIT Bombay campus and its Gaushala, and your unforgettable talk on �Ecological Harmony and Social Responsibility: Inspiring Global Efforts Toward Sustainable Living and Community Building��all of these reinforce within us the spirit of serving Gaumata and Bhumadevi for the pleasure of Sri Sri Radha Giridhari, and becoming a mere speck of dust at the lotus feet of Sri Giriraj, who is himself Hari-dsa-varyo.\n\nThe recently concluded Govardhan Yatra was absolutely pure nectar�the very epitome of the mood you have been tirelessly cultivating within our hearts.

    "Your Offering": "1. Empowering Leadership Rooted in Compassion\nThrough his teachings, personal example, and spotless character, Guru Maharaj has nurtured countless devotees, helping them grow in spiritual maturity and serve society with greater devotion and responsibility. He often reminds us that a true leader is one who creates other leaders, and by his warmth, care, and deep concern for every soul, he inspires devotees to lead and uplift others with sincerity and love.\nGuru Maharaj leads not by authority, but by empowerment, humility, and unconditional compassion. His presence gives courage, his words give direction, and his love gives purpose. He teaches us that real leadership in Krishna consciousness means becoming an instrument of Krishna�s mercy for the upliftment of all.\nGuru Maharaj�s pure character and divine qualities touch the hearts of all who meet him. Even a gentle smile, folded hands, or a loving embrace reflects the bhva of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and speaks more powerfully than words.\n\n2. Unmatched Humility, Love, and Personal Care\n\nGuru Maharaj�s humility, love, and care touch the hearts of everyone. He is deeply personal in his dealings, showing genuine affection and attention to each devotee.\nHis every word and action reflect pure love flowing from a heart filled with devotion and compassion.\n\n3. Realised and Revealed Lectures\n\nGuru Maharaj�s lectures are truly heart-touching and completely eye-opening. His simple yet profound analogies give instant strength and clarity, helping me understand what a genuine bhakta really means.\nOne analogy that deeply touched my heart is that of the solar panel. Just as a solar panel absorbs the light of the sun and then gives that same light for the benefit of others, in the same way, a devotee must first absorb spiritual strength by sincerely receiving the mercy of the Lord and Guru. Only then can he share that light with the world.\nA solar panel has no ego. It knows that it is not the source of energy; it simply receives and gives. Similarly, if we want to offer something meaningful and uplifting to others, we must first fill our hearts with something higher�devotion, purity, and spiritual wisdom. We can only give what we have truly received. By Guru Maharaj�s teachings, I pray to become a humble instrument to carry and share even a small ray of that divine light.\nEncouraging True Absorption in Krishna Consciousness\nGuru Maharaj teaches us to practice Krishna consciousness with true absorption. He explains that real absorption means to tune our heart and mind while chanting, praying, and meditating. To absorb ourselves in spiritual life is to open our hearts to absorb the grace of the holy name, the grace of kirtan, the grace of the Lord, and the grace found in sincere prayers.\n4. A Storehouse of Divine Qualities (By Hg Rukmini Krishna Prabhu Ji)\n\nGuru Maharaj is a true reservoir of divine qualities. His humility, simplicity, and purity of heart naturally attract everyone. When he speaks Hari-katha or describes the pastimes of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, those divine moments feel present and alive, as if the spirit of Mahaprabhu�s movement is flowing through his words, kirtan, and compassionate dealings with all.\nDespite empowering and guiding so many wonderful leaders within the movement, Guru Maharaj remains completely humble and detached, always seeing himself as a servant of the Vaishnavas. His character and devotion remind us that true greatness is measured not by position, but by the depth of one�s love and surrender.\n\n5. A Loving and Genuine Glorification of Devotee Service\n\nI witnessed this beautiful nature of Guru Maharaj during the Kartik Yatra 2025 in Govardhan. While speaking Hari-katha, Guru Maharaj lovingly glorified every devotee engaged in service. One statement touched my heart deeply�he said that the kitchen devotees are not merely cooking to feed others, but are sharing a love-feast, offering devotion through every detail of their preparation.\nHe mentioned how some Matajis were making nearly 20,000 chapatis by hand, serving tirelessly from 4:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. for all five days of the yatra. Guru Maharaj expressed that in the holy abode of Govardhan, the Lord is watching their service, and that such loving service is never futile. Every small act done to please the devotees brings great joy to the Supreme.\n6. Complete Faith and Surrender to Guru and Krishna\n\nIn every lecture and in his daily life, Guru Maharaj remains absorbed in a mood of transcendental devotion. In his kath and krtan, we can feel his genuine gratitude to Srila Prabhupda, his loving respect for the Deities and the Holy Name, and his unwavering surrender to Guru and Krishna.\nGuru Maharaj�s love is not limited to humans�he sees all living beings as parts and parcels of Krishna and extends his affection to everyone. During the Govardhan Yatra, Guru Maharaj beautifully shared that the Vrindavan mood is not �I and Me�, but �We and Us��the mood of the Brajavasis, who live only to please Sri Sri Radha and Krishna and to spread this spirit of loving cooperation."

Gurudev, the love you have for Srila Prabhupada is so deep that you remember him and his instructions and are trying to serve in this modern, advanced world, accommodating the living entities as per their comforts and likings, and seeing to it that by preaching in different ways, you do not deviate from Krishna consciousness and disobey Srila Prabhupada's instructions. The projects that you have started, the thoughts that you have implemented, and the preaching that you have done is different and unique and transforming many souls. You have given independence to your disciples to preach as per the need of the hour, and this is exactly how Srila Prabhupada did, different from other disciples of Bhakti Siddhant Saraswati Thakur Maharaj, and brought a revolution throughout the world, as he always felt that whatever he has achieved was empowered by his Guru and gave the credit to his Gurumaharaj. By doing things differently, you faced challenges and disagreements, but you had faith in Srila Prabhupada's instructions, and thus by not deviating from that, you achieved success in all of your services. And this is how all of your brahmachari and grihasta disciples are preaching by their wisdom and acharan, following your instructions, and are successful too. It's amazing to see 10,000+ devotees coming together in yatra, serving, chanting, and cooperating just to please your holiness, the same way as you want to please Srila Prabhupada.\nDear Gurudev, I always feel you are with me, watching me, correcting me, showing the right path to me, guiding, loving, caring, protecting me, and always showering your causeless mercy and blessings unto me. You know exactly when to inspire me, when to humble me, like a mother does to her child for his growth. By your divine vani, association, and by associating with your senior disciples, we learn a lot about your mood and your instructions that you have spoken to them. They share those with us at the right hour of need, which makes me feel how much you love me and care for my inner transformation of heart.\nToday, for my own purification, I beg at your lotus feet that may I develop a deeper connection with you by being a good disciple of yours, following your instructions, and serving and respecting devotees without ulterior motives and care for the ones who trust me in this journey of Krishna consciousness.\nI always admire the loving exchanges you have with your godbrothers and godsisters; so much to learn, digest, and most importantly, apply in this lifetime practically.\n\nThank you, Gurudev, for everything that you have given me, though I am not at all qualified.\n\nYour most insignificant servant\nPadma Kishori devi dasi"

Every time I think of you, it�s as if the sun rises in my heart and a beautiful meadow of yellow flowers appears with you standing in the centre, illuminating my entire being. Never could I have expected to receive such incredible mercy, such an incredible spiritual master in my little life, a teacher who embodies Srila Prabhupada�s mood and teachings so expertly, naturally and joyfully; it is just absolutely beyond what I could have ever wished for!\nYour presence in my heart is such a powerful light that shines all over my internal world, dissipating all darkness. You are truly the sun of my heart, the sunshine of my life.\nYour darshan that I treasure with all my heart gives me so much hope, so much joy.\nI truly don�t know how to convey the joy I feel when I see you. My heart sings, rings, jumps and dances all over like a monkey gone mad. I just try to stay calm from the outside, but the joy I feel, it�s beyond me.\n\nI am so limited, so fragile at times, so vulnerable and have such a long way to go. But when I am with you or think of you, I feel strong! I feel that by your mercy, YES, it�s possible! This life may not be a life of comfort, but it definitely is the life meant to give our hearts back to Krsna and just surrender unto Him!\nHow easy He made it for us, this life, even if it�s so hard at times due to deep-seated anarthas and countless samskaras. But when I feel I cannot handle anymore punches of maya, I simply think of you and your glance. You see straight into my soul, beyond all my layers of conditioning, all of my limitations, and look straight into my heart. It is such a mercy that I can�t even handle it sometimes, spending days just in awe of your mercy and the joy you exude to all those fortunate souls that receive your darshan. I constantly feel the desire to please and allow me to serve you.\n\nGurudeva, thank you times a billion for believing in me, for allowing me to be your disciple, for trusting me and giving me such incredible shelter that I just don�t even know how it is possible that I may receive such pure care and encouragement. It touches me deeply; it humbles me to my core. And all I can think of is how much I want to make you happy by serving all of God�s children. Then so much love pours into my heart that it just floods over.\n\nYou have given me a new life, healed my heart to such a degree that now I just want to give back for the rest of my life, all that I have, all that Krsna allowed me and entrusted to me. It is not possible to give what I have received, but I will try nevertheless.\nWhen I see you laugh, when I close my eyes and see you sit in lotus position, the way you share your incredible pastimes, your sound effects, your eyes when they lit up in the middle of a story, and the countless words of wisdom that flood into the room, filling my being with such purity, such taste, cleansing my heart and mind from useless worries that were occupying my being before I entered the room, I come home inside.\nYou are truly the miracle of my life.\n\nSomeone was saying that you are so merciful, that you actually embody the quality krpalu.\nThey could not be more true. When you appear in public, the eyes of the people looking at you, receiving your darshan, say a thousand words. I love going through the photos and videos of seeing how people look at you, their expression, their eyes� as in their eyes you can actually see your mercy. Their expression is that of receiving mercy. The light within them ignited, instantly forgetting all their worries, simply by being touched by your mercy. Your presence is the embodiment of mercy and grace.\n\nSimply by your glance, you bring out the absolute best in people, often without them even realising it.

There is nothing more joyful, more beautiful, more fulfilling, more inspiring than seeing you happy and serving you.\nEven if I can�t see you sometimes for years, I feel so seen and cared for, so sheltered by your mercy, and it�s so deeply humbling�.\nFrom the very first time I met you, under that tree in rainy Cologne, each word you said went straight into my heart and remained there, becoming unforgettable. How, with just a few words, you can completely change someone�s life. It�s a miracle.\nAnd how blessed I am to be in the presence of such a miracle. How blessed I feel to be your disciple. There are no adequate words to truly express how deeply, incredibly, utterly blessed, humbled, and so immensely grateful I am for all that you are and do.\nWhatever you would like from me, please know nothing gives me greater joy than to serve and please you.\n\nWith all of my being, with my entire heart and soul, thank you so very much Gurudeva.\nThank you for giving me a chance in this life, the chance to truly deepen my relationship with Radha-Krishna, the chance to truly come back to Them one day, if They wish.\nThank you for helping me serve Srila Prabhupada better. Thank you for giving me the strength, compassion, and courage to pick myself up every time I am pushed back into the darkness.\n\nEvery word you ever spoke to me is with me, and it keeps me going with full faith and so much enthusiasm in my heart. Thank you for the constant realisation of how incredibly, utterly fortunate I am. Thank you for teaching me how to serve others. Thank you for teaching me how to heal my entire life. Because you are my life.\nSo now my life is completely perfect.\n\nForever your servant\nVraja Sundari Devi Dasi"

Although we can listen to your lectures and kirtans online, it is always a very special and uplifting experience to see you in person.\n\nJiva daya - Accompanying you on harinam in Florence and Venice was a blissful experience, seeing you sharing Krishna�s grace. And during the Journey Home book launch in Slovenia, you charmed all the attendees and touched their hearts with your message and life story.\n\nVaishnava seva - When you were giving darshans to the devotees from our Slovenian yatra, we always felt your love and care. This year even our teenagers appreciated it, when you encouraged them about their university studies in connection to spiritual life. In those moments, it seemed as if time stood still, and you had all the time in the world for us.\n\nNama ruci - When you led kirtans at Villa Vrindavana and Prabhupada Desh, our hearts always melted. And when we chanted japa with you in the mornings, we felt profound spiritual peace and joy simply by being in your presence.\n\nAlthough you have so many disciples, meet countless important people, and guide innumerable projects, it is through these small acts of kindness that you show us that relationships at the end of the day matter most�our relationships with Lord Krishna, with the devotees, and with all living beings.\n\nOn your 75th birthday, we wish you a lot of joy and happiness in your loving service to Srila Prabhupada and Krishna.

All glories to Srila Prabhupada. All glories to you on this most auspicious day of your Vyasapuja.�\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, you have so many wonderful qualities that are a great inspiration. I would like to highlight a few in the interest of time:\n\n\t1. Guru nistha and Guru prem\nYou never lose a single moment to glorify your spiritual master A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Anytime anyone credits you with the wonderful service you are doing, you attribute it to Srila Prabhupada�s mercy and look for every opportunity to please your Guru. I recall during a disciple meeting in Alachua, when a devotee asked you about ways in which we can serve you, your answer was to help you serve Srila Prabhupada�s mission.\n\n\t2. Tolerance, mercy and compassion - qualities of a sadhu\n\nYou are an epitome of tolerance as noted in several instances we read in Journey Home. You always quote the verse trinad api sunichena taror eva sahishnuna to teach us to be tolerant.\n\nYou are a true sadhu as you have the great qualities as mentioned in the following verse:\n\ntitikava kruik suhda sarva-dehinm\najta-atrava nt sdhava sdhu-bha\nThe symptoms of a sdhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities. He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime. (SB 3.25.21)\n\nBy hearing about you from previous Vyas puja offerings, it is an inspiration to know the ways you develop and maintain such personal relationships with everyone, which surely testifies to your realization of your personal relationship with Krsna. You show such compassion to the living entities like me who are in a state of forgetfulness of Krsna, by constantly preaching and giving so much of your time, guidance, and care.\nGuru Maharaj, I am eternally grateful to you for giving me shelter and for blessing me during initiation. It has given me encouragement and great strength to render devotional service and to serve the mission of Sri Caitanya Maha Prabhu by spreading the holy name and message of the supreme lord.\n\nI am thankful to you for the enthusiasm that you provide to me to manage my spiritual life through your insightful lectures filled with enthusiasm and heart-warming humor. You are such an expert preacher, Guru Maharaja; each time I hear you speak I am amazed at how you are able to say exactly what I need to hear. I vow to continue to listen and apply lessons learned from the lectures and by hearing & reading about your glories. Only by your mercy can I perform devotional service while managing my prescribed duties.\n\nPlease bless me with increased Krsna consciousness so I may serve others in the humble mood of a servant of a servant.\n\nekaki amara, nahi paya bala,\nhari-nama-sankirtane\ntumi kripa kori', sraddha-bindu diya,\ndeho' krishna-nama-dhane\n\nAlone, I do not find the strength to chant the holy name of Hari. Please be merciful and, blessing me with a drop of faith, bestow on me the great treasure of the holy name of Krsna.\n\nI pray at your divine lotus feet to always have your shelter despite my shortfalls. Thank you for being there when I need you.\n\nI beg at the mercy of Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Madan Mohan to keep you in best health for preaching Krsna Consciousness all over the world.\n\nThank you for everything you gave me this year. I look forward to serve you more and more. Please bless me so that I can follow your instructions and become a worthy servant of yours.\n\nYour insignificant servants,\n\nRasarja Gopal Ds and Priya Gopi Dasi"

All glories to you!\n\nCC Madhya 19.151\n\n    \n--  -   \nbrahma bhramite kona bhgyavn jva\nguru-Krishna-prasde pya bhakti-lat-bja\n\nTranslation\n\n�According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Krishna. By the mercy of both Krishna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.\"\n\nWe wander through this world, and by the mercy of the Lord, this world is blessed by the presence of saintly, divine souls � the beloved of the Lord, the beloved of Lord Krishna. Such souls are exceedingly rare and difficult to find, and even more difficult to associate with. They are powerhouses of mercy, kindness, and divine qualities.\n\nHow we long to imbibe even a small particle of those qualities � even a small particle of your own divine qualities, dear Gurudev. You walk among us and shower us with all those blessings.\n\nAmong your countless beautiful qualities, there is one that shines especially brightly for us: your unlimited mercy. Your mercy manifests in so many ways and in so many forms � each like a precious and incomparable gift.\n\nOne of your greatest gifts to us is your time � time granted to you by the Lord, which you so mercifully share with us all. You spend your time connecting us, guiding us, uplifting us.\n\nYour long lectures and teachings, infused with love, care, and compassion, give us life, hope, and knowledge � without which our spiritual journey would be unthinkable. Sometimes, just a few minutes of your time are enough to protect a devotee from the danger of going astray. You never hesitate to walk long distances to visit a disciple in the hospital, or to call and speak with someone in the moment they need you most. The sacrifice of your precious time for our enlightenment is the pinnacle of your mercy.\n\nEven today, we still marvel at the causeless mercy you have shown to us. Although your presence in this world is rare, Krishna allowed our paths to cross, so that ordinary, insignificant, and fallen souls like us could receive a chance � a priceless opportunity. On this auspicious day of your anniversary, we pray that you continue to grant us this chance, and that we may never fail to use it properly.\n\nWe pray to hold firmly to your instructions, your love, and your divine lotus feet.\n\nRecently, we heard in one of your lectures that whatever realizations, good qualities, and abilities we possess are not our own; they are lent to us solely for the purpose of helping and serving others. We pray, our beloved Gurudev, that whatever we receive on our spiritual journey may be used wisely, and only for the purpose for which it was intended.\n\nYour servants,\nBhagavata das & Jayanti devi dasi"

On this sacred day of your seventy-fifth appearance, my heart longs to glorify you � for your presence is a blessing that brings life, hope, and devotion to countless souls.\n\nGurudev, you are the living expression of Srila Prabhupada�s compassion. Every word you speak, every gentle action you take, and every tear that falls from your eyes reflects your unwavering love for Srila Prabhupada and his movement. In your heart, Srila Prabhupada�s desires remain safe; through your life, his vision continues to flourish. Whenever I think of you, I feel that Srila Prabhupada must be smiling, for you carry his legacy with such sincerity, humility, and purity that even sacred places awaken under your touch.\n\nBy your inspiration, forgotten heritage has risen again. In Vrindavan, I visited Radha Damodar Temple � where Srila Prabhupada prayed and prepared to fulfill his spiritual master�s desire � your devotion feels alive, like an unbroken continuation of his offering. Standing near Rupa Goswami�s samadhi, one can sense the very qualities you embody: humility, gentleness, and a deep longing to serve. At Sanatan Goswami�s samadhi, your sincerity shines like a quiet flame � reminding all who come near that devotion is measured not by quantity but by the simplicity of the heart. And at Narottam Das Thakur�s samadhi mandir, the loving way you share Krishna consciousness � through warmth, care, and genuine affection � feels like a living reflection of his own devotional mood.\n\nYour life carries sacredness wherever you walk. And in Kolkata, I witnessed something extraordinary. Bhaktivinoda Asan � once a neglected, dilapidated house � now stands beautifully restored, dignified, and spiritually vibrant. This is the place where Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur wrote, prayed, and nourished the seeds of Lord Chaitanya�s teachings for the modern age. To see it revived felt like witnessing history come alive. Only someone carrying Srila Prabhupada�s heart could restore such an important jewel of Gaudiya heritage with such care and devotion. In that moment, I felt deeply that Srila Prabhupada must be so pleased with you.\n\nGurudev, your qualities are beyond explanation. Your humility softens even the hardest hearts. Your compassion heals those who feel forgotten. Your kindness gives hope to souls who have lost direction. Your forgiveness melts hurt. Your presence alone brings comfort. You guide not with force, but with love so deep that it inspires transformation from within.\n\nTo glorify you is to glorify the very essence of devotion. Your life shows what it means to serve Srila Prabhupada with one�s entire being � mind, heart, breath, and soul. Because of you, sacred places are awakening, devotees are finding shelter, and Srila Prabhupada�s movement is becoming strong, vibrant, and lovingly nourished.\n\nOn this holy day, I pray that even one drop of your qualities may someday touch my heart. Please bless me to become humble, gentle, sincere, and dedicated like you, and to serve Srila Prabhupada�s movement with affection and devotion.\n\nGurudev, thank you for being there. Thank you for loving Srila Prabhupada so purely. Thank you for pouring compassion into the world and touching the hearts of so many with your tenderness. Thank you for all that you have given, all that you continue to give, and all that you will inspire for generations.\n\nWith deep gratitude, affection, and surrender,\nI place this small offering at your lotus feet.\n\nYour eternally aspiring servant,\nAnwesha"

Your glories are incalculable, and my gratitude can never be fully expressed in words, though my heart longs to offer it to you at every moment.\n\nEach day, I am reminded of the immeasurable fortune of your association, which you so mercifully shower upon me with love and grace. I am indebted to you for noticing someone like me, lifeless, forlorn, and ignorant, and blessing me with your shelter. Without you, life feels like a path of danger and hopelessness, but with you, I feel protected, guided, and deeply loved.\n\nYou have the rare gift of seeing only the good in others. I will never forget the first time I met you in person, after you spoke on the Hawk and Fish narrative from �The Journey Home�. With hesitation, I approached you and said, �Your talk was very nice.� To my amazement, you smiled and replied, �You are very nice.� Carrying insecurities from lifetimes, I felt my heart captured by your humility and kindness. You are truly a collector of hearts�loving even those of us riddled with flaws and failures, yet guiding us as a steadfast father toward our highest potential.\n\nWhen I was engaged in transcribing your lectures, I experienced perhaps the most fulfilling service of my life. Each word I typed felt alive�like drops of nectar falling into my heart. Listening again and again, I realized your voice was not just sound vibration but a wave moving beneath the surface of my being, creating silent tremors that reshaped my journey in Krishna consciousness. Your lectures are soul-stirring; they both comfort and challenge. They soothe our restless minds with compassion, yet awaken us to urgency�reminding us to take shelter of the Supreme Lord without delay.\n\nThrough this service, I began to see bhakti not as a theory but as a living reality. I learned to recognize anarthas, not with despair but with hope, and to view them as obstacles removable through the process you so patiently explain. You taught me how to face them step by step, and how to anchor my life in the principle of following the instructions of guru and Krishna.\n\nDuring this time, my daughter was within me, silently receiving the current of your words along with me. Often, I would replay the same class multiple times, carefully catching every phrase, and I would think, �She is also receiving this.� Today, I see her as a gift of your mercy linked to you, not just through me, but through the sound of your vani that she received even before birth, nourished by the same stream of transcendental sound.\n\nOn this auspicious day, I pray that I may forever remain under your shelter, serving you in whatever small way I can, carrying your words within my heart until they blossom into unwavering devotion. Your love and guidance have captured my life completely, and by your mercy, I aspire only to be your servant, now and always.\n\nYour servant, and daughter\nAnanga Sundari devi dasi"

I want to know everything.\"\nI was speechless, couldn't speak a word. Yes, there was a lot going on in my mind, and your midas touch, personalism, and your unconditional love within seconds took away everything I was experiencing due to uncertainty on the financial front, due to health issues caused by the stress of my cousin sister who was going through turmoil, and multiple other issues.\nAfter I got back home, I was reflecting on another experience I had with you in New Vrndavan, where there was one devotee who was experiencing a severe problem with his tooth, due to which he had swelling in his mouth. Since he didn't have money and insurance, he was struggling.

Actually, it will be very easily attained if I just follow your footsteps. Praying for your mercy to achieve this.\n\nFinally, when you entered India, you promised that you shall do something good for the people of India. Whenever I read this sentence, it echoes in my ears; a divine, grave voice says, \"He is referring to you. Are you going to do something substantial to make his words come true\" This has not happened just once, but every time I read that paragraph. When I turn to see who spoke this, I see Krsna on one side and Gaurahari on another side. \"Get up, stay focused, just follow him, and fulfill his expectation he has from you.\" I hear this. This is your mercy and protection.\n\nIn one 2024 initiation lecture, you said that \"In our conditioned state, we might not take seriously the blessing, the opportunity, the light, and the beauty of life in this world.\" My prayer is that I want to take the opportunity you have given me to seek deep association with the sincere devotees from the Chowpatty and BCEC temple, who are following your instructions very sincerely and with complete surrender. My prayer is that I want to take the opportunity to hear and develop a taste to hear, read, and imbibe Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, and all the Gaudiya scriptures absolutely essential for me, from the great teachers you have given me.\n\nIn another class given by you in 2020, you mentioned that \"Compassion is the most meaningful human experience.\" From the bottom of my heart, I mean this: that I need your mercy to follow this. I want to follow this instruction all the time; my desire is to possess this quality as my natural nature. When I heard how you stopped the car, got down from it, and came to the little puppy and chanted the Hare Krsna mahamantra in its ears, since then, I always pray that I want my heart to be a storehouse of compassion towards all. I want to please you with this quality; please grant me your mercy.\n\nAs a new year meditation in 2021, you mentioned that \"When we understand our purpose, nothing will discourage us.\" Amongst many of your quotes that I have collected and stored in my heart, this one is very important for me, and this quote has helped me in many situations of life. In some difficult or challenging situations when I need to stay motivated, I stand in front of your photograph, pray to you, and remember this quote, just like Krsna spoke; I hear these words from you, \"Give up lethargy, get up, and fight.\" I receive a lot of strength from this instruction.\n\nDear Guru Maharaj, there are many, many instances of how your quotes have emerged like a lighthouse in the middle of the ocean with giant waves of uncertainty, or like a torch in a deep, dark cave of hopelessness, or like a rose with many thorns of challenges.\n\nI am ever grateful to you, to dear Srila Prabhupada, and unto Sri Sri Radha Gopinath that all of them sent you into my life, and the boat of my life received a captain who can navigate my life with his golden words and with his own life as the best example I can ever follow.\n\nSeeking your shelter more than ever, begging for mercy and empowerment to be able to fulfill the expectations you have from me, so that I can please you dearly.\n\nMay I always remain your servant and the servant of those who serve you, who assist you in the mission of HDG Srila Prabhupada, your daughter Kalyani Radhika devidasi."

    "Your Offering": "Dearest Gurudeva,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your ever-effulgent lotus feet. All glories to you.\n\nGurudeva, in my life, time and again I witness how fortunate I am to be under your shelter. Every moment living is fully a mercy for me; this I realized more in this year.\nBack in 2023 during Radhashtami, I got to know that you are in India. I came to the temple with a lot of questions, whether or not you are my spiritual master. Then, by Radharani's mercy, I got an opportunity to serve for designing her dupatta, and after that, I got very personal darshans of yours. At that moment, I decided you are my spiritual master, which got stronger by one of the lectures by Radharani mataji on your vyas puja. Gurudeva, after that day, I realized how important seva is. Throughout this journey, I got so much nourishment from all your senior disciples, which increased my faith and love for you. Gurudeva, I only pray that may I have the qualities of your sincere disciples who serve you without any ulterior motive and serve you with great love.\nThere were few reciprocations of devotees with you which was very personal; it was shared with me, and I was very happy for them, as the loving exchange was so pure and deep to the heart. The next day, I had a dream in which you told me two things:\n1. You already have it.\n2. Always prioritize others before you.\nThese two things I will never forget, Gurudeva, and always follow.\nThis year, after watching Mahavtar Narsimha, I realized a lot of things and can see the mood which you always share.\n\nashlishya va pada-ratam pinashtu mam\nadarshanan marma-hatam karotu va\nyatha tatha va vidadhatu lampato\nmat-prana-nathas tu sa eva naparaha\n\nMay I make this my life and soul.\nWhen you were in Italy, I started to read \"The Journey Home\" as a letter from you every day, and the reciprocations which you gave me were very personal. I felt deep separation from you at that time. In one of the lectures, one mataji told this: \"If you remember your guru, he will be right with you, and serving his instructions are like associating with him.\" Gurudeva, I really don't know what is my capacity to serve you, but I really want to serve all the Vaishnavas and you without any duplicity.\nThis year you called me to Vrindavan, Govardhan. The glories of Vrindavan are so amazing and mystical, and as Srila Prabhupada said, you can't go to Vrindavan just by booking a ticket. Gurudeva, I realized this; whatever happened in Govardhan was purely and purely your mercy.\nAfter returning, my life changed in a very different way which I never expected. I was able to survive this whole time only for you. Remembering you at all these hard phases and that assurance that you are there for me was my only hope.\nI always want to come to you in every situation because you are my only shelter.\nI always want to be attached to you, Gurudeva. I know you hold my hand so tightly; please let me not leave your hand in any situation.\nAnd finally, the day came when You returned to India. The day when everything was so magical and unreal. From morning 6 am, we all were engaged in decorating Radha Gopinath and shops.\nThe feeling of finally, after months, this separation is going to end, and the happiness of decorating our Home with all the devotees was so special. You were so happy after seeing all of this, and that glance of yours when I offered you a rose gave all the assurance whether you knew what all happened and how much I missed you.\nNext day, October 12th, in your Sunday class, this class was so personal to me, and you answered all my questions. The moment when you said paramtm is always with you, it is right beside you and will never leave you... and GURU IS THAT EXPANSION OF PARAMTM! You revealed this exactly what I wanted to hear. Your desperation to take me more close to Radha Gopinath and always serve the devotees are always a reminder for me to become better day by day. During Srila Prabhupada's disappearance day, I intensely prayed to him that you are very dear to Srila Prabhupada, and your commitment towards his instructions is so strong; may I also have the same commitment towards your instructions and make them my life and soul.\n\nThe love which you hold for all your God brothers and God sisters is so pure and unconditional; this increased my attachment towards all the Prabhupada disciples. Your Gauralila series is so filled with love and instructions; may I inculcate and understand the mood you hold. Hearing your lectures is like associating with you. I have taken some sankalpas for your vyas puja; bless me for properly fulfilling them, and this brings me more close to you and Radha Gopinath and serves all the devotees with great love.\n\nAfter experiencing many things in this year, I realized this is not the place where I actually belong to. Even in the devotee community, love and compassion are very much needed. The perspective which you gave me to hold the good things and leave the bad things back. Each and every individual is so special and dear to Radha Gopinath and you, whether they are connected to ISKCON or not. I'll always remember this and try to serve them to my fullest.\nGurudeva, may I always be attached to you and only you, expecting nothing from anyone. Please make me humble and compassionate for serving you and all the devotees.\n\nAspiring to be the servant of the servant,\n\nLakitha\n(Mumbai)"

We were going to perform a drama about the dacoits who attacked the Mayapur temple in earlier times. Just before the drama, I was distributing Mayapur Mahaprasad so that we all could be in the mood of Mayapur Dham while performing the drama. While distributing Mahaprasad, HH RNSM came in front of me, and I took the opportunity to give Mahaprasad to Maharaj. I was having a small packet of dry sweets, which are in the shape of a square (shakarpara). I took one piece to give to Maharaj, as the dry sweets were limited and devotees were many. But when I gave it to Maharaj, he did not accept the Mahaprasad and gestured with his hand to put that single piece back in the packet. So I did the same, and then Maharaj gestured with his hand to offer the whole packet to him, and I did what Maharaj was telling through direction. Now Maharaj took the lowest of all lowest particles from that Mahaprasad and ate it, and Maharaj left from there with a smiling face. I then continued to distribute Mahaprasad to other devotees.\n\nLater, after many months, I realized that Maharaj was telling me that whenever you offer anything to the guru, you should always offer 100% to the Guru. This teaching was given to me without speaking a single word, and that too in hardly a two-minute duration. So I feel that great souls can teach so many things if we take their association, either in vapu or vani, with proper consciousness.\n\nAll Glories to Guru Maharaj."

Maharaj says:\n\"\"Unless a person is happy within his own heart, no matter what he achieves, he cannot be truly happy.\"\"\n\nThe real treasure lies within us. Unfortunately, we have forgotten it. But once we rediscover it, we will never be unhappy again.\n\nSadly, even after coming to Krishna consciousness and practicing for years, we sometimes fail to experience that inner joy. This is why unfortunate situations arise where devotees struggle to harmonize with each other�whether in the community or within families.\n\nWhen we feel unfulfilled inside, we try to satisfy ourselves through external means�by accumulating wealth, material comforts, power, positions, fame, and recognition. But these cannot give us lasting happiness. In fact, they often become sources of suffering. No external method can ever satisfy the heart.\n\nIf we are joyful within, we will always remain content and spread happiness everywhere.\n\nOn this auspicious occasion of your 75th Vyasa Puja, I offer my heartfelt gratitude to my spiritual master, His Holiness Radhanath Swami Maharaj, for blessing me with the wealth of Krishna consciousness. I pray at your lotus feet for intelligence and determination to always follow your instructions and serve Krishna according to your desires, so that my human life becomes truly successful.\n\nYour insignificant servant,\nRadhageeta Devi Dasi (Nasik)"

Whatever spiritual direction or sincerity we possess has arisen only through your causeless mercy, spiritual teachings as well as personal example. Your life of humility, compassion, and unwavering dedication and sacrifice for uplifting everyone whom you touch continues to be the guiding light of our own faltering steps on this path.\n\nGuru Maharaj, my good wife and I are especially grateful for the invaluable opportunity you have given us to serve the Vaishnavas through our seva as ophthalmologists at Bhaktivedanta Hospital. By your grace, we are able to render service to so many devotees, including your dear Godbrothers, who carry Srila Prabhupada�s mission in their hearts. Being allowed to serve them, even in small ways, is the greatest blessing in our lives. It constantly reminds us that spiritual life is expressed through service, love, and respect for all those connected to you and the glorious mission of Srila Prabhupada. We are also extremely grateful for the opportunity to associate and learn from many of your senior disciples who are the founding members of Bhaktivedanta Hospital. We see the values and teachings instilled in them coming from you. Whenever we struggle or lose focus, your instructions and your example realign our hearts and give us renewed strength to carry on with our spiritual lives.\n\nOn this sacred day of your Vyas Puja, we pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinathji to bestow upon you a long life ahead filled with good health and vigour. Your presence on this planet is making it a better place in countless ways for numerous people all across the world.\n\nOn this sacred day, we also pray for the intelligence to follow your guidance, the strength to stick to the principles, the humility and sincere desire to serve the Vaishnavas, and the commitment to deepen our connection with the holy name. May we remain forever an instrument in your hands and in the hands of your representatives in our lives.\n\nYour insignificant servants,\nShyam Mohan Das, Dr. Suvarna Bhagde, Janhavi and Gaurang"

You are the embodiment of the mercy of Sri Sri RadhaGopinath, and it is only by Your causeless kindness that this desire to offer my heart has arisen.\n\nYour Instructions Are My Life\n\nYou have taught us that the instructions of the Guru are everything. I once foolishly thought that if I could only receive personal, direct instructions for every small step, the path of bhakti would be easy. But You, in Your infinite wisdom, showed me the truth in a way I could never forget.\n\nI remember the morning I was listening to your lecture, planning my day. I had chanted my rounds and thought, \"I will complete the rest on the train.\" It seemed like a perfect, sincere plan. But then, from your own lips, you spoke the words that shook my very soul: \"We shouldn't chant in the train.\"\n\nO Gurudev! In that moment, my heart stopped. You were not just speaking to a crowd; you were sitting right beside me, guiding me, correcting me. You revealed to me that you are always with me, watching over this struggling soul. You taught me that bhakti is not about convenience; it is about consciousness. It is about offering our full, undivided attention to the Holy Names. That day, you didn't just give an instruction; you gave me the profound realization of your ever-watchful presence. It is not easy to always follow, but by your mercy, everything is possible.\n\nMy Shelter and My Family\n\nWhere would I be without the shelter of your words Your lectures are my solace, my guiding light in the darkness of this age. And in your divine arrangement, you have given me another great gift: my senior godbrothers. Seeing their unwavering faith, their humility, and the way they carry you in their hearts is my constant inspiration. In their association, I feel I am always with you, for they are your true servants, fully surrendered to your mission. They are living proof of your transformative power.\n\nMy Humble Prayers\n\nMy only prayer, my dear Maharaj, is for your long, healthy life. Please stay with us for many, many years to come. Please continue to uplift us, to tolerate our mistakes, and to purify our duplicitous hearts. Our only responsibility is to be sincere and humble, and even that we borrow from you.\n\nI know I am the most fallen. I know I will always be the last in the queue of your followers.

Our hearts are nourished by your gentle instructions, love, and affection for our whole family for the last 30+ years.\n\nToday, I am appreciating the wisdom that you have shared with all of us. It is all in the scriptures, but so often we miss it, even though we read and understand the story or pastimes. I am meditating on this wisdom from our scriptures that makes not only human relations palatable, but it makes us humans. It is this wisdom that gives birth to loving relationships, not only among devotees but among all relationships, rather among all interactions. It is this mood of love and care that you have poured into the hearts of your followers. In that encounter with the border security officer of Ferozepur, you made that commitment to Officer Sardar ji that \"I promise to do something good for the people of India... please give me a chance.\" Now I am wondering if Lord Krishna put those words in your v and He also empowered you to execute your promise through the blessings of Lord you received on your head from the hands of Sardar ji. This year, I witnessed for many days the results of your compassion in Kumbh Mela by seeing how millions of devotees benefited by honoring super fresh and hot prasadam by Mega Kitchen. This year, I also noticed how much love and affection Vraj Basis have for you because of your long, loving reciprocations with them via eye camps, dental camps, and now the most needed Barsana Hospital. This year, I also witnessed in GEV thousands of pilgrims, including highly cultured, wonderful, and professional school children, coming and breathing fresh air and allowing the divine mercy of Sri Madan-Mohan ji to enter the depths of their hearts. So, the promise, Gurudev, you have made to Sardar ji on the border of India has been fulfilled a long time ago. My family is also one of the recipients of the prasad you have mercifully distributed, not only to Indians but much beyond the borders of India. We are eternally indebted to you.\n\nWe are praying to you on this auspicious day to bless us with the wisdom of your heart to serve your desire in service to your Gurudev, Srila Prabhupada.

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna dear Guru Maharaj\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet\nAll Glories to Srila Prabhupada and your Holiness.\n\nI�m very grateful and infinitely indebted to have your divine shelter in my life. As I look back into my life�s journey, it�s inconceivable how your compassion, your divine presence has transformed my life, the lives of my family members, and all of them whom I know. And yet, as a neophyte, I�m just starting to realize this aspect - considering what our incredible fortune has been in this life after traversing through 8.4 million species to connect with a bonafide Guru completely surrendered to Srila Prabhupada.\n\nGuru Maharaj, I want to offer my gratitude for so many things to you. Today I am reminded of an instance from 2020 when moments of your association changed our life. During this time, my wife, Anuradha Priya DD (not initiated then) was battling 4th stage cancer. None of the treatments were working. She was bedridden for 8 months and doctors felt she could pass away any moment. Under this critical situation of intense pain, battling life and death, her faith was very shaky and mostly down. With two children aged 5 and 13, she had constant anxiety of separation from children which could happen any moment. The devotees of the Michigan congregation were constantly serving us with counseling, prasadam, their intense prayers, taking care of our kids, grocery shopping, and so many other innumerable ways that are beyond our comprehension. However, since we had just stepped into Krishna consciousness, this reversal in life combined with no results from any treatment and our previous misguided association acted as a deterrent to Krishna consciousness for my wife. Needless to say, I was helpless, clueless, and could not be of any service other than praying for help. It was during this time that HG Yugal Kishore Prabhu kindly arranged for a disciple meeting with you for all the devotees in the Michigan congregation over Zoom. It was a very sweet meeting where all the devotees were offering their heartfelt gratitude and seeking your blessings, and it was as if you were distributing benedictions filled with enormous love. Just seeing the exchanges filled our hearts with gratitude. When my turn came, I was blank and couldn't speak anything. At this time, HG Yugal Kishore Prabhu kindly briefed you on our family situation and requested your prayers for my wife. During this time, you spoke to her for less than a minute. You affectionately spoke to her saying - Krishna is with her in this fight and she should do the needful. You also mentioned you will pray for her. That association of a few moments was transformatory for my wife and my entire family. The care, love, and affection that she experienced gave her strength, and you instilled her faith which didn't exist moments before. Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur sings - ohe vaishnava thakur, dayaro sagor��.krishna je tomar krishna dite paro, tomaro sakati aache. Lava matra sadhu sange sarva siddhi hoye. I could see a tremendous transformation in her from that moment. Because of the power of the prayers of a pure devotee as yourself, her health immediately in 2 weeks started improving radically and she regained very close to normal health. This reboosted her faith, and she was able to continue in Krishna consciousness, and her heart was filled with gratitude for what she received. During this time, she had expressed many times her desire to serve all the congregation devotees someday who were constantly serving us. After having a healthy life for about 2 years, the cancer was back, and her health began to deteriorate in 2022. During all this time, she had an intense desire to get initiation from you and get the beads from your divine lotus hands in person. As her health continued to deteriorate, I did not know how this would be practically feasible, and I suggested that she consider online initiation (as in my heart, I knew that time is running out). But she was persistent in her desire. Towards Nov 2022, we were notified about upcoming initiations in Ohio in the next few weeks. She was very excited about it, but I knew it had challenges because by this time, she had lost her mobility significantly. Just days before the initiation, as my anxiety grew (on how to carry her to Ohio), we were told that you were coming to ISKCON Farmington Hills for the initiation ceremony which was a 7-minute drive from our home. This overwhelmed us with joy, and we could understand immediately it was an immense shower of mercy from your Holiness. Even better, you were coming on the occasion of your divine appearance. It was on this occasion that she got initiated. Time flew quickly, and we were on the day of initiation. During initiation, as she was trying to somehow wobble and move towards you (due to low mobility), you noticed her approaching slowly, and the first thing you said on noticing her was, �I�m praying for you.� Visually, she looked way different from when you had seen her in 2020. This was due to the chemo treatment her looks had changed, but we understood - you could see the soul within and immediately identify. Guru Maharaj, this meant so much for us. After all, who are we We are just nobody, but your love is so unconditional. Your love towards us is non-different from the love that Krishna has (saksad hari twena samasta sastrair). And this is our hope, Guru Maharaj. We could be no one today, but if we could develop genuine sincere loving service towards you, then our this birth would be most successful. Going back to after initiation, 24 days after the initiation, your spiritual daughter, Anuradha Priya DD, left her body, surrounded by devotees with giriraj charanamrit, dust of Govardhan sprinkled on her body, maha garland of Sri Sri Radha Kunjabihari, Sri Sri Radha Gopijana Vallabh, and Sri Sri Radha Shyam Sundar. You were on the flight when all this was happening, but by your divine arrangement, there was HH Radha Govind Das Goswami Maharaj and HG Malati Prabhu and so many congregation devotees on a Zoom call chanting for her in the middle of the night. Our sincerest heartfelt gratitude for delivering Anuradha Priya, Guru Maharaj. As I look back, this is incomprehensible even today in my mind how this happened, but it's purely your causeless compassion by which there's a shower of unlimited mercy. Going back to the Zoom call of 2020, you showed by personal example what is actually compassion through your genuine care and affection. Having seen this, experiencing this, I realized that it's not just the words that made a difference, but your genuine pure devotion and your mood of servant of the servant in service to Srila Prabhupada. Guru Maharaj, at this point, I want to admit and beg you for something. I have to admit that I am totally unqualified to be your disciple as I don't have any devotion in my heart and I�m bereft of even a drop of the mood that you carry. I would humbly beg, clasping your lotus feet, to bestow your causeless mercy so that I can serve Srila Prabhupada�s movement birth after birth in the mood of servant of servant with genuine devotion. I want to please you, Guru Maharaj, by sincerely following your instructions. You had mentioned to senior devotees that the below five items would please you, and hence I humbly seek your blessings:\n- Going deep into hearing, chanting, and service\n- Cultivating the mood of pleasing Krishna\n- Striving to be united as a community\n- Practicing enthusiasm to share Bhakti (Krishna consciousness)\n- Never forgetting that Bhakti is not about quantity but about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n- Being a good example personally for the upbringing of children in a Krishna conscious way.\n\nI have so much to share because your causeless mercy is infinitely protecting and inspiring us, but I seek your blessings so that I can journal these going forward as my memory is fading away and I don't want to lose these moments.\n\nBefore concluding, I want to offer my highest gratitude to you for your causeless mercy:\n- Giving me devotees in my life, especially some devotees who are constantly sustaining me on a day-to-day basis\n- Reconnecting us always with Srila Prabhupada�s mission\n- Gifting with your classes - always stressing on pure devotional service, how we can please Krishna and his devotees (Vaishnav seva). In fact, your love for your God brothers and God sisters, Vrajavasis, and for all devotees in general is heart-melting and always reflects your love towards Srila Prabhupada.\n- Giving your invaluable association in Kartik yatra thru Hari Katha, Hari Kirtan, giving us the unlimited opportunity to get your divine association and the association of those whom you love, amidst your super busy schedule - you were cooking for us, you are making us realize how grateful we need to be to all those who are serving to making this yatra happen, you are showing us every moment how much you value your God brothers and God sisters and practically everyone around you.\n- Giving us unlimited opportunity to learn so much during Kartik yatra from the association of all exalted devotees around us.\n- Giving us a wonderful congregation in Michigan and enthusing us every moment.\n- Gifting us with your divine association during Sadhu Sanga this year.\n- And many more�.\n\nLast but not the least, Guru Maharaj, you�re giving us so much and in fact persistently giving yourself to us despite all odds. I beg for your blessings so that one day I understand your heart and can be a menial instrument to give you pleasure in each and every thing I do, every moment to moment. I offer my sincere prayers at the lotus feet of Sri Sri Radha Kunjabihari, Sri Sri Radha Gopijana Vallabh, Sri Sri Jagannath Baladev Mai Subhadra, Sri Sri Gaura Nitai, and Sri Sri Nitai Patita Pavan Gaurahari that they bestow you long life with good health so that you can deliver millions of souls for the pleasure of Srila Prabhupada.\n\nYour insignificant servant\nAnanta Vilas Das"

I was reciting Srimad Bhagavad Gita verses and also hearing Krishna's greatness in the discourses since childhood. However, my attraction for Krishna Katha and specially the sweetness of the Lord's pastimes primarily came through your merciful classes.\nHearing your classes kept me hooked to the movement. When I went to pursue MBA at IIM and a little away from Mumbai, I thought I might not be able to continue. Hearing your classes saved me there too. And after coming back, you formally accepted me as your disciple. I understand this debt can never be paid off to the Spiritual Master.\nThis year's Kartik Yatra at Govardhan was very special for various reasons. In my own little understanding, detailed Krishna Katha and especially Krishna's returning to Vrindavan pastimes amazed me. Your Srila Prabhupada consciousness throughout the Yatra, especially the evening Katha, compels me to think how one should always remember our Spiritual Master.\nI have heard so many times that Shravanam is an important limb of bhakti. And it should be processed through Mananam/Chintan to transform us for ultimate purification. With Krishna willing and your mercy, I pray to get strength to practice these principles in my life.\nys,\nmukunda sundara dasa"

    "Your Offering": "Dearest Gurudeva,\nPlease accept my humble obeisances at your ever effulgent lotus feet. All glories to you.\n\nGurudeva, in my life, time and again I witness how fortunate I am to be under your shelter. Every moment living is fully a mercy for me; this I realized more this year.\nBack in 2023, during Radhashtami, I got to know that you are in India. I came to the temple with a lot of questions: whether or not you are my spiritual master. Then, by Radharani's mercy, I got an opportunity to serve for designing her dupatta, and after that, I got very personal darshans of yours. At that moment, I decided you are my spiritual master, which got more strong by one of the lectures by Radharani mataji on your vyas puja. Gurudeva, after that day, I realized how important seva is. Throughout this journey, I got so much nourishing guidance from all your senior disciples, which increased my faith and love for you. Gurudeva, I only pray that may I have the qualities of your sincere disciples who serve you without any ulterior motive and serve you with great love.\nThere were few reciprocations of devotees with you which was very personal. It was shared with me, and I was very happy for them as the loving exchange was so pure and deep to the heart. The next day, I had a dream in which you told me two things:\n1. You already have it.\n2. Always prioritize others before you.\nThese two things I will never forget, Gurudeva, and always follow.\nWhen you were in Italy, I started to read \"The Journey Home\" as if it were a letter from you every day, and the reciprocations which you gave me were very personal. I felt deep separation from you at that time. In one of the lectures, one mataji told this: if you remember your guru, he will be right with you, and serving his instructions is like associating with him. Gurudeva, I really don't know what my capacity is to serve you, but I really want to serve all the Vaishnavas and you without any duplicity.\nThis year you called me to Vrindavan, to Govardhan. The glories of Vrindavan are so amazing and mystical, and as Srila Prabhupada said, you can't go to Vrindavan just by booking a ticket. Gurudeva, I realized this: whatever happened in Govardhan was purely and purely your mercy.\nAfter returning, my life changed in a very different way which I never expected. I was able to survive this whole time only because of you. Remembering you at all these hard phases and that assurance that you are there for me was my only hope.\nI always want to come to you in every situation because you are my only shelter.\nI always want to be attached to you, Gurudeva. I know you hold my hand so tightly; please let me not leave your hand in any situation.\nAnd finally, the day came when you returned to India. The day when everything was so magical and unreal. From morning 6 am, we all were engaged in decorating Radha-Gopinath and shops.\nThe feeling of that finally, after months, this separation is going to end, and the happiness of decorating our Home with all the devotees was so special. You were so happy after seeing all of this, and that glance of yours when I offered you a rose gave all the assurance whether you knew what all happened and how much I missed you.\nNext day, October 12th, in your Sunday class, this class was so personal to me, and you answered all my questions. The moment when you said Paramatma is always with you; it is right beside you and will never leave you. And Guru is that expansion of Paramatma! You revealed this exactly what I wanted to hear. Your desperation to take me more close to Radha-Gopinath and always serve the devotees are always a reminder for me to become better day by day. During Srila Prabhupada's disappearance day, I intensely prayed to him that you are very dear to Srila Prabhupada, and your commitment towards his instructions is so strong. May I also have the same commitment towards your instructions and make them my life and soul.\n\nThe love which you hold for all your God brothers and God sisters is so pure and unconditional. This increased my attachment towards all the Prabhupada disciples. Your Gaura Lila series is so filled with love and instructions. May I inculcate and understand the mood you hold. Hearing your lectures is like associating with you. I have taken some sankalpas for your vyas puja. Bless me for properly fulfilling them, and this brings me more close to you and Radha-Gopinath and allows me to serve all the devotees with great love.\n\nAfter experiencing many things this year, I realized this is not the place where I actually belong to. Even in the devotee community, love and compassion are very much needed. The perspective which you gave me to hold the good things and leave the bad things back. Each and every individual is so special and dear to Radha-Gopinath and you, whether they are connected to ISKCON or not. I will always remember this and try to serve them to my fullest.\nGurudeva, may I always be attached to you and only you, expecting nothing from anyone. Please make me humble and compassionate for serving you and all the devotees.\n\nAspiring to be the servant of the servant,\n\nLakitha\n(Mumbai)"

I also cherished how, in the first two days of the yatra, you emphasized that \"actual knowledge is when we get faith in the inconceivable pastimes of Krishna.\"\n\nMaharaj, you always set the perfect example of being a loyal follower of the Guru Parampara. Although you carry the simple and pure-hearted mood of a Brajwasi, for the pleasure of Srila Prabhupada you tirelessly go above and beyond�taking on various projects, meeting influential people, and guiding so many leaders with great care.\n\nMaharaj, please bless me and guide me so that I may become a loyal and valuable asset to our Guru Parampara.\n\nYour undeserving servant,\nVihari Govinda Das"

    "Your Offering": "o aj�na-timirndhasya j�n�jana-alkay\ncakur unmlita yena tasmai r-gurave nama\n\nDearest Gurudeva,\n\nMy heartfelt obeisances at your extraordinarily merciful lotus feet. Glories to Srila Prabhupada and his army of stalwart soldiers like yourself who are absolutely unreal. Majestic.\n\nThis year I find myself meditating on the meaning of \"lotus feet\". We read and hear about it so much and it is used so casually; it's a pet peeve to hear it being used loosely in conversation. A lotus, growing in the muck, rises gracefully and blooms, then sinks silently in the gloom, day after day. Its fragrance unaffected, its beauty unrestricted. The putrid slime rolls off it every dawn, the untainted, delicate wonder of nature. Its roots grow deep and hold the lotus strong�in that murky mess! Oh, why does the lotus not find another home, more suited to match its simple, pure self Rather, it anchors itself there, thriving, serving to purify the water and soil from excess nutrients and pollutants. It contributes in such a phenomenal way�by being there simply, and adding color and loveliness in an otherwise seemingly unattractive space. Isn't this how you have led your life from your very childhood You have seen the world, Srila Gurudeva, the great, terrible, and repulsive. The upside-down rainbow of your smile...so innocently charming and unlimitedly compassionate. You're that lotus, dearest Gurudeva.\n\nAnd your feet have traversed no-man's lands and badlands and lands that take away all the bads, the dhams. A man goes where his feet take him, and yours have been invariably attracted to r rpa ma�jar pada. You have put your unshakable faith and sought shelter in the line of impeccable cryas, and that very same sanctuary you have come to transparently extend to us here. Mind-bogglingly unfathomable, yet an irrevocable fact. Each word of the Guru Vandana prayer rings true, and when I can sing, it is a window into Srila Prabhupada's place in your heart and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's place in the heart of Srila Prabhupada and so on. Yours ARE lotus feet, dearest Gurudeva. I may never conceive the full meaning, though I say with absolute certainty that it is the most freeing truth. I pray to tightly grasp onto it and keep it close to my heart forever.\n----\nOver five millennia ago, our sweet Lord brought the Vrajavasis to Govardhan for seven days and nights. You also manifested a Yatra that brought us all together, from different corners of the world, for seven days and nights. All our eyes were on the look-out for you, searching, or on you whenever the opportunity would present itself. And you'd reciprocate with us all appropriately, like our sweet Lord did with the Vrajavasis. We've prayed deeply together and danced ecstatically in your offerings of kirtan. You have thoughtfully, prayerfully, and lovingly manifested the Govardhan Ecovillage as a service to our beloved Srila Prabhupada, the service from which I'm certain without a doubt, the universes are benefitting! HG Baladeva Prabhu had shared how the Yatra happening at Govardhan was nothing short of \"amazing,\" beginning with it being a long-standing desire of yours. My tiny heart had also been pining for that place with so much personality...and you're truly a desire tree. I'm reflecting on the Yatra that was, and it is bittersweet; I have such a longing to be back there...in the association of remarkable devotees from across the globe. Such a dream! Like bees drawn to the lotus�YOU drew us to you, sweetest Gurudeva.\n\nTo mark your diamond jubilee, my kind senior Godbrothers have made romantic efforts like doing a 75-day glorification countdown to your appearance day, and also 75 lessons to be learned from your life as cited in your autobiography, The Journey Home. All this, to please you of course, and more so to uplift those like myself who are incapable of even scratching the surface of the deep mysteries of your unbelievable magnanimity and spotless character. On this most auspicious and holiest of all days, I celebrate you with a prayerful, gratitude-filled heart. I gleefully rejoice that though you are not of this world, you have appeared at a time when I came to attend to some \"unfinished business\" on this planet�and by some stroke of luck, mostly your deep concern for aimlessly floating jiva-baddhas like myself, you have showered your benevolent glance at me and accepted me. To me, you're that treasure that has no bounds. I pray for your good health so you may continue to touch thousands upon thousands with your bottomless compassion and unmatched humility. I pray that I may get the eyes to appreciate a droplet of the love and dedication that you have for serving Srila Prabhupada in the mood of *dsa-anudsnudsa* eternally, and that I may experience even a fraction of that dedication towards you.\n\nYour servant and daughter,\nHladini-gopika devi dasi\nNew Remuna Dhama\nISKCON Toronto"

It is only by your sincere desire to please Srila Prabhupada, that our temple is one of the most looked upon temple in the ISKCON world for the devotional standards and practices to follow. You have so painstakingly worked day and night to ensure that our temple always maintains the highest standards in all fronts, be it Deity worship, Devotee Care, Varishata Vaisanav care, the care and love for your god brothers and Sisters, the care for the young generations and so many other fronts.

All our mistakes and offense are directly affecting to you but you are tolerating all these and still giving us the shelter and spiritual nourishment.\nWe shamelessly beg forgiveness from you for all our numerous offences committed towards you the Vaishnavas directly or indirectly in any way and request that please do not forgo us.

With whatever limited ability I have, I am trying to serve in one of your projects, while simultaneously striving to remain connected to your instructions and to remember and apply them as much as possible.\n\nIn one such class, you shared a profound lesson about the story of Kailash Baba in the Himalayas. Kailash Baba didn�t know a word of English, and you didn�t know Hindi � in fact, you didn�t even know which language he was speaking. Yet the communication between both of you was completely clear. You said, �Transmission of knowledge is not just based on words; it is based on the eagerness to learn and the compassion to give. Because he so deeply cared about me and I was so eager to learn, just by his pointing his fingers and moving his eyebrows, I could understand what he was saying. And I learned more from him than I ever learned in all the schools I went to in America � because real knowledge comes through grace.�\n\nI often introspect and wonder: where am I lacking When will I develop the eagerness to truly receive the transcendental message that is flowing through the parampara I am certain there is no lack of compassion in you and our acharyas. You, Srila Prabhupada, and all our previous acharyas have tirelessly worked to distribute the deepest wisdom of Krishna consciousness. Yet I feel that I am the one who lacks the sincerity and eagerness to properly receive this priceless gift. And thus I continue to remain on the mental platform, without coming to the right conclusions.\n\nSo, Maharaja, on this most auspicious day, my heartfelt prayer is that I may develop sincere longing and receptivity to receive the most compassionate knowledge that is coming from you � for it is the easiest and most sublime process to attain the highest perfection.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nYour servant,\nMukundamala Das"

Just taking a moment in remembering you fills the heart of everyone with great joy just as a spirit soul hankering for krsna�s love is at once completely satisfied. Because you carry Krsna in your heart very strongly and You carry pure devotees who carry krsna in their hearts like Srila Prabhupada. In the recent Govardhan Yatra I was just stunned to see your overwhelming gratitude for your Guru Maharaj, it was an incessant flow of love and gratitude outpouring from your heart in a genuine way. When will I develop such feelings for my spiritual master!!! Far way to go, yet you are so merciful. Although I keep forgetting time and again what I have received You always remind me through your lectures and example and through your true representatives. Your Vani and example are my only shelter. It is said the Instruction of a Spiritual master is the greatest form of mercy for a disciple, and those who follow them with their body mind words and their very lives always live with him. Thankyou so much Gurudev for bestowing us with your invaluable instructions. Its more than a lifetime project to follow your instructions to-to. Some of the senior devotees approached you to seek some instructions for all the disciples on this special 75th Vyaspuja, and You replied:\n1. Please go deep into hearing, chanting and service.\n2. Cultivate the mood of pleasing Krishna.\n3. Strive to be united as a community.\n4. Practice enthusiasm to share Bhakti - Krishna Consciousness.\n5. Never forget that Bhakti is not about quantity or numerical, but it is about pleasing Guru and Krishna.\n\"I will say the same whether it is 25th birthday or 50th or 75th.\"\nEach and every instruction I see is only to bring us more closer to eternal truth and nothing for your self. The 10 instructions that you have given for the Brahmacharis are so famous, I wish to strive my best to follow each of these to please you. One of the very important instructions is NEVER CRITICISE anyone no matter whatever or whoever they are!! I can personally observe this disease of criticism being deeply rooted in my heart, in my thoughts words and dealings. Very difficult to overcome this tendency no matter how many times I try. It is all because I�m not humble at all, I feel myself to be somewhere better. But Gurudev, You are expert in making anyone (whether it is your God brother or any insignificant being like a small calf) feel special by fanning their original identity (which is so great) and by your genuine appreciation. You emphasise in every lecture trinadapi sunicena�and you are a living example for it. That�s why you attract so many people�s love. Please give me strength Gurudev to become genuine and free from criticism for anyone.  \nIn this recent yatra You have given your fullest mercy to everyone. How you reciprocated with Brajvasis on the stage, with all the common devotees, with the senior devotees, and with all the sevaks at various levels is simply amazing. And especially your lectures were even more special, they were filled with many of the acharya�s and your�s vraja prema. Kirtans were filled with enthusiasm and eagerness to take shelter of Holy names deeply, it transported us to a different realm. A very special opportunity for unlimited seva for all sevaks to make tremendous advancement by serving 1000s of devotees at a time. Thank you so much Gurudev for everything. You boost us in the yatras and then again continue to do in the communities where we are sheltered by your decades of endeavor. I�m going on receiving so much but practically doing nothing to please you. \nThere are many devotees who follow your instructions with great care and attention (one Example is HG Vikram Gauranga Pr) free from criticism always with great maturity dealing with concern for everyone. Our communities have such shining examples to remind me constantly your mood and mission. Sometimes some of the newly upcoming devotees of our student center also are much better in this aspect. I have been given this exalted service to counsel and care for their krsna consciousness but I�m not qualified. Only to please my superiors I�m trying to render this service. My only hope is just help them take shelter of your vani and example and that will surely groom them to success on this path of krsna consciousness. Guru Maharaj, Please bless me that one day I become a worthy disciple of yours following the footsteps of your exemplary disciples, try to shoulder your burden instead of becoming a burden. \n\nYour insignificant Servant\nSharad Purnima Das"

    "Your Offering": "Yet, amidst all this transcendental grandeur, the one who quietly serves everyone, the humble servant of the servants, carrying their slippers on his head, attending to every need with love and devotion, that would be you, our dear Gurudev, rla Radhanath Swami.\n\nThe heart of our sampradya is the pastimes of Lord Chaitanya, something which was never revealed to the world until rla Krishna Dsa Kavirj Goswm revealed them. He saw himself as lower than a blade of grass and more fallen than a worm in stool, yet the most esoteric and confidential realities of the spiritual world were revealed in the form of r Chaitanya Charitmta and the most esoteric r Govinda-llmta.\n\nYou often remind us, Mahrj, that �the humble and meek shall inherit the kingdom of God.� The deepest truths descend only into a heart that is td api suncena. And if someone were to ask me where that quality has taken shelter in this age, I can only say with conviction that it shines in my Gurudev, rla Radhanath Swami.\n\nGurudev, I am an ocean of faults, salty and restless. But if even one drop of your compassion falls into this ocean, then the aquatic creature-like soul of my body can taste the nectar of rmat Rdhr�s lotus feet.\n\nPlease claim me as your own and cleanse me, just as a mother patiently cleans her mischievous child. I have nothing else, nowhere else, and no one else."

In interaction with all, your dealing  was very heart touching, personal and loving. Your offering of respect to them was the very much same, seeing them equally on spiritual platform. The qualities of humility, pridelessness, equanimity and respectfulness that we hear of so much are exemplified in your personality and touched our hearts.  The words of sastra prove to be theoretical until we don�t see such qualities practically in  living personalities.\nYour genuine concern for all categories of devotees - young, old, Matajis, children  over their Prasadam, seating arrangements, festivals, health, hearing arrangements etc. - shows your love and care for them. That inspired us in giving care to others. \nThank you guru Maharaj for lovingly  accepting the insignificant gift , this gesture of yours increased our enthusiasm in your Vani Seva. We always remain grateful to you for engaging us in Seva through your disciples. \n\nOn your 75th appearance day, we offer our heartfelt prayers for your good health to Sri Sri Radha Gopinathaji.\n\nHare Krishna. \nYours aspiring servants,\nSundari Vrindarani Devi Dasi\nBla Svarupa Dsa"

    "Your Offering": "Respected Guru Maharaj,\nPlease accept my prostrated obeisances at your lotus\nfeet. On this most auspicious occasion of your 75 th Vyas Puja day I feel gratitude filling in\nheart for all the mercy you have bestowed in my life. Gradually, I am realizing increasingly\nhow you have been always present in my life especially at difficulties and helped me\ncontinue the path of Krishna consciousness in the association of devotees.\nIn Srimad Bhagavatam Mother Devahuti prays to Lord Kapila:--\ntasya tva� tamaso &#39;ndhasya\ndu�p�rasy�dya p�ragam\nsac-cak�ur janman�m ante\nlabdha� me tvad-anugrah�t\nTranslation: --�Your Lordship is my only means of getting out of this darkest region of\nignorance because You are my transcendental eye, which, by Your mercy only, I have\nattained after many, many births.�\nAnd Srila Prabhupada Writes in purport: --&quot; By the instruction of the spiritual master, the\ndarkness of ignorance is removed, and thus the disciple is enabled to go to the side of\nfreedom.�.\nSimilarly in the next verse Srila Prabhupada writes: --&quot; Similarly, without the light of the\nSupreme Lord, or without the divine grace of the spiritual master, one cannot see things as\nthey are.�\nIt has been indeed your Vani which caused great attraction in my heart to take shelter of\nyour holy lotus feet and take to Krishna consciousness seriously by joining brahmacari\nashram. Your Vani is like very powerful sun which lights up the contaminated region of my\nheart and shows me the path back to Supreme Lord.\nI remember when I was in Kolkata back in 2014, as usual I was confused with so many\nthings going on in my life and even about some things I saw in association of devotees, and I\nhas asked in a long letter so many questions to one of your senior disciples. Later when you\ncame to Kolkata you had lectured on the section of Indra offends Brihaspati and you said\nhow when one offends spiritual master then the sad ripus take over the mind and sense s.\nIn a similar enlightening but deeply touching and yet illuminating note you said:� Even if one\ndrops atom bomb on your head, you will remain the servant of Krishna�.\nThis formed a deep samskara in my heart and the question of relationship of Jiva with\nsupreme Lord became crystal clear. Until then I had superficial understanding of how the\nJiva is a servant of servant Of lord but ten when I started reading Bhagavad git ai discovered\nso many sections where Srila Prabhupada emphasized the same point. Everywhere I read in\nSP books I found the same line.\nIn those times when you had visited Kolkata and gave that lecture, I was reading The\nBhagavad Gita 2 nd chapter that time and I found so many lines where SP emphasized it: --\nFor example, in BG 2.55 he wrote: --&quot; The highly developed soul always remains satisfied in\nhimself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord. Such a\ntranscendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism;\n\nrather, he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme\nLord.�.\nAnd in BG 2.66 SP writes� Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with\nKrishna is certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much he may make a\nshow of peace and spiritual advancement in life. Krishna consciousness is a self-manifested\npeaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with K�ishna.�\nIt was then I started to deeply reflect on the sambandha of the souls with the Lord which was\ncovered over by so many doubts, delusions and distractions.\nI could see how you were impacting on my consciousness at the relationship of soul and\nKrishna in my life not juts theoretically but at a consciousness level. Till then thinking of\nmyself to become a servant of others I theoretically accepted but on practical level I thought\nof better options otherwise.\nThus, not only have you clarified my Deep-seated doubts, but you have nourished my soul,\nprotected my bhakti and preserved me in the association of devotees.\nLater in 2022 when my mother was ill and I had to attend her, almost every day I found a\nmiracle, I could see your presence in my life, how you were working to uplift me by giving me\nvisions of Krishna�s arrangement and your blessings in my life. And in those periods the\nlectures of yours which I heard made perfect sense to me I terms of the situation I was in.\nIn that year 2022 during the health crisis of my parents, in many situations which were\nbeyond the scope of my mind you had helped me like: ----\n1.Local devotees helped me take my mother to hospital.\n2.While going to Bhubaneswar we were going in the car at 90 kmph and the front tyre burst,\nbut still we were saved.\n3.Although it seemed for time being my mother had lost mental balance later, she recovered\nquickly.\n4.When I wanted to show my mother to a famous heart surgeon, I came to know we can see\nhim after 6 months but in the next day we could meet him, because of some acquaintance.\n4.When I was in the car accident later and being taken to police station, I just tried to pray to\nyou and as soon as we reached the police station, we found an influential devotee just\nbeside it. He even gave his car that day to go ahead and later released our car from police\nstation.\nIt can be said these are all Krishna�s arrangement, but I would rather say it was all your\nbenediction by which this arrangement happened.\nAnd every time I Have tried to put my consciousness to serve I have found your physical\npresence whether be it in Pune, Mayapur or at Govardhan.\nYour Vani in different lectures has been slowly correcting my blindness although my\nblindness largely remains. Even after some years of slow and so-called practice of Krishna\nConsciousness I find myself at the same place where I Started years ago. Due to my\noffenses, laziness and neglectful sadhana I have not been able to work in the direction of\nyour expectations.\nTherefore, on this most auspicious day I beg at your lotus feet few benedictions. Let my life\nbe of some service at your lotus feet. Please give me strength to follow your instructions.\n\nPlease let me try to give me my offending and criticizing nature. Please let me do proper and\nattentive sadhana of hearing your lectures, reading Srila Prabhupada�s books and chanting\nas you have instructed. Let me remember all the mercy that has been gifted to me by you\nand many other Vaishnavas and let me remain grateful to them.\nYour servant,\nRama Vallabh das"

    "Your Offering": "Hare Krishna, Dear Gurudev,\nPlease accept my most humble obeisances.\nAll glories to Srila Prabhupada.\nAll glories to you on this most auspicious occasion of your divine appearance day.\nGurudev, I offer my deepest gratitude for accepting me and giving me shelter at your lotus feet. I beg forgiveness for not writing an offering for such a long time. When I look back at my life, I shudder to think what would have become of me had you not mercifully accepted me. I am such a fool, repeatedly making blunders that bring suffering to myself and my family. Yet, despite my ignorance, you continue to shower your compassion upon me.\nMany times, my only strength came from hearing your lectures and chanting the holy name. These two gifts kept me alive and gave me the courage to continue. Because of my entanglement in job and family responsibilities, I often feel I have failed to follow your instructions properly, and that has caused some spiritual weakness in me. Still, you never gave up on me.\nThe last four months were the most painful period of our lives. Everything seemed to collapse, and we shed tears almost daily. In those dark moments, only the holy name, Gaur-Nitai, and your instructions were our lifeline. By your mercy alone, the situation has now begun to improve, and we are hopeful that everything will soon be resolved.\nDuring those days, we were struggling just to survive in this material world, while also trying to hold on to devotional life. Whenever I felt helpless, I remembered your hardships and sacrifices in New Vrindavan. I remembered your profound words in your lectures, and the inspiring pastimes shared by devotees about your compassion and determination. These memories always relieved my heart and gave me new strength to continue.\nGurudev, we are not sincere devotees. We are fallen, inconsistent, and full of faults. But even so, we have only one prayer: please never abandon us. Please keep us always in your shelter. Without your guidance and mercy, we have no hope.\nOn this sacred day of your appearance, I sincerely pray to Sri Sri Radha Gopinath Jee that They bless you with strong health, protection, and spiritual strength so that we may receive your association for many, many years. May you continue to illuminate our hearts with your nectarean Krishna-katha and transform our lives with your divine presence.\nYour aspiring servant,\nRasik Raman Das, Rani Kumari, Ramya Kumari and Ragha Karn"

Earlier, I was not very regular or consistent in hearing your lectures. But since the last one year, I have been making a conscious effort to hear you every day. Most days, I am able to listen to a full lecture, and on days when I cannot, I at least hear a 10 to 15 minute clip so that I do not lose your shelter. This daily connection has helped me stay grounded and reminded me of my purpose.\n\nRecently, I also listened to The Journey Home in your divine voice. I had read it before, but hearing it from you, the author, was very special. It again revealed your adventure, sincerity, and seeker spirit. It showed me how Krishna has prepared you to uplift people across the world. The story itself is very inspiring.\n\nMaharaj, Krishna has given me all the required facilities and many opportunities to serve the mission of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Srila Prabhupada. The only thing lacking is my commitment.\n\nIn the last few years of practicing Bhakti, I have understood why you emphasize humility so much. I see that this bodily identification in me is still very strong. Even while performing devotional activities, I sometimes think of myself as someone special or capable. This tendency pulls me away from genuine surrender. Please help me overcome this, Maharaj, so I can truly surrender to Krishna and serve in the right mood.\n\nMaharaj, I also struggle with my chanting. It takes me a lot of time to complete my rounds, and I want to improve. I am ready to make whatever efforts are needed. Please bless me so that I can chant with sincerity, steadiness, and affection.\n\nThank you so much for everything, Maharaj.\n\nYour insignificant servant, Amit Joshi"
